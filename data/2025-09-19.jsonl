The East Pacific is characterized by bottom-heavy\nprofiles, while the West Pacific is characterized by top-heavy profiles.\nAlthough inter-basin differences in the horizontal SST gradient are known to be\nimportant, physical reasons for why these omega structure variants exist are\nnot fully understood. This question is addressed using a steady, linear model\non an $f$-plane with $n$ atmospheric layers. Convection and radiation are\nparameterized as linear responses to thermodynamic perturbations with\nconvective nonlinearity approximated by convection on/off regimes. The free (or\neigen) modes of the model yield vertical structures resembling the observed\nbaroclinic modes of the tropical atmosphere, with each mode associated with a\ncharacteristic horizontal scale (the eigenvalue). In the standard parameter\nregime, the first-baroclinic mode has a large spatial scale ($\\sim$ 1500 km)\nwhile the second-baroclinic mode has a smaller spatial scale ($\\sim$ 250 km).\nWhen the model is forced with a strong- and weak-gradient surface temperature\n($T_s$) patterns, the resulting omega profiles assume bottom- and top-heavy\nstructures respectively -- mimicking the observed differences between East and\nWest Pacific Oceans. Additional dependence on the magnitude of the Coriolis\nforce is also observed. The connection between the vertical structure and the\nhorizontal scale of the baroclinic modes explains why a strong-gradient $T_s$\nprofile projects strongly onto the second-baroclinic mode yielding bottom-heavy\nomega profiles in the eastern Pacific, while a weak-gradient $T_s$ profile\nprojects strongly onto the first-baroclinic mode, yielding top-heavy omega\nprofiles typical of the Western Pacific."}

While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise,\nthey struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of\n3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and\ninformation scarcity, we propose a novel method, \\textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that\nintegrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian\nSplatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh\nfaces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior\nsurface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage\nfoundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to\ncomplement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when\ndistilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting\noptimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct\nparameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training\nstrategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to\noptimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination\nof enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our\napproach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction.\nExperimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared\nto existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance\nfidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled\nprior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and\ntemporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses."}

To tackle this\nproblem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface\ndetection and fitting is proposed.

As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and\na long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with\ndiverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large\nviewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and\nreference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely\non 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification\nframework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D\nreasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the\nfirst stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for\ngenerating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then\nestimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,\npreventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When\ninvoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a\n3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a\nkeypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences\nbetween query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity\nscoring.

In this paper, we\nutilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot\nsolution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to\ndynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \\textit{grounding tokens},\nfor grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal\ngrounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query\n(\\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we\npropose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel\ndecomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented\nassembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH\nstrategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action\nsub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and\ntemporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to\nlearn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token\npredictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action\ncues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and\ntemporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the\nattribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS\nstrategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the\ntemporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We\nevaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods\non three common STVG benchmarks.\n  The code will be available at https://github.com/zaiquanyang/LLaVA_Next_STVG."}

We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image\ndataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season\ncrop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting\ndetermines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as\nreplanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and\nerror-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD\ncontains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse\ngrowth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles,\nand densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows\ndetection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among\ntested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for\nsingle plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall\nup to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity\nand irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further\nreduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11\nmaintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for\nsaving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that\nenhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time\ndecision-making.

We\nidentify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual\nsemantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency,\nand spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively\naddressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to\na novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models\n(ST-AR).
