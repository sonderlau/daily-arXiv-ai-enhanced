### [1] [Probabilistic Super-Resolution for Urban Micrometeorology via a Schrödinger Bridge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12148)
*Yuki Yasuda,Ryo Onishi*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究使用薛定谔桥模型进行城市2米温度的超分辨率重建，相比扩散模型，在保持相似精度的同时将计算成本降低到1/5，并展现出更好的不确定性量化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统扩散模型在超分辨率任务中计算成本高的问题，探索更高效的薛定谔桥模型用于实时集合微气象预测。

Method: 使用特定的薛定谔桥模型直接从低分辨率数据变换到高分辨率数据，而不是像扩散模型那样从高斯噪声生成数据。数据来自物理模型在不同分辨率下的数值模拟。

Result: 薛定谔桥模型达到与扩散模型相当的精度，但计算成本仅为1/5（10次神经网络评估vs 50次），生成样本方差更大，不确定性量化更优。

Conclusion: 薛定谔桥模型因其较低的计算成本，为实现基于超分辨率的实时集合微气象预测提供了可行性。

Abstract: This study employs a neural network that represents the solution to a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem to perform super-resolution of 2-m temperature in
an urban area. Schr\"odinger bridges generally describe transformations between
two data distributions based on diffusion processes. We use a specific
Schr\"odinger-bridge model (SM) that directly transforms low-resolution data
into high-resolution data, unlike denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(simply, diffusion models; DMs) that generate high-resolution data from
Gaussian noise. Low-resolution and high-resolution data were obtained from
separate numerical simulations with a physics-based model under common initial
and boundary conditions. Compared with a DM, the SM attains comparable accuracy
at one-fifth the computational cost, requiring 50 neural-network evaluations
per datum for the DM and only 10 for the SM. Furthermore, high-resolution
samples generated by the SM exhibit larger variance, implying superior
uncertainty quantification relative to the DM. Owing to the reduced
computational cost of the SM, our results suggest the feasibility of real-time
ensemble micrometeorological prediction using SM-based super-resolution.

### [2] [SpikePool: Event-driven Spiking Transformer with Pooling Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12102)
*Donghyun Lee,Alex Sima,Yuhang Li,Panos Stinis,Priyadarshini Panda*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文分析了脉冲变换器在频域中的行为，发现它们表现为高通滤波器，并提出SpikePool方法用最大池化注意力替代脉冲自注意力，实现选择性带通滤波效果，在事件视觉任务中取得竞争性结果并显著降低计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管脉冲变换器在事件视觉任务中表现出色，但其处理事件数据的基本机制尚不明确。当前方法主要关注架构修改，缺乏对底层信号处理特性的分析。

Method: 通过频域分析发现脉冲变换器表现为高通滤波器，提出SpikePool方法用最大池化注意力替代脉冲自注意力，创建选择性带通滤波效果。

Result: 在事件分类和目标检测任务中取得竞争性结果，训练时间减少42.5%，推理时间减少32.8%。

Conclusion: 频域分析揭示了脉冲变换器的高通滤波特性，SpikePool通过带通滤波平衡了高频信息保留和噪声抑制，为事件数据处理提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Building on the success of transformers, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have
increasingly been integrated with transformer architectures, leading to spiking
transformers that demonstrate promising performance on event-based vision
tasks. However, despite these empirical successes, there remains limited
understanding of how spiking transformers fundamentally process event-based
data. Current approaches primarily focus on architectural modifications without
analyzing the underlying signal processing characteristics. In this work, we
analyze spiking transformers through the frequency spectrum domain and discover
that they behave as high-pass filters, contrasting with Vision Transformers
(ViTs) that act as low-pass filters. This frequency domain analysis reveals why
certain designs work well for event-based data, which contains valuable
high-frequency information but is also sparse and noisy. Based on this
observation, we propose SpikePool, which replaces spike-based self-attention
with max pooling attention, a low-pass filtering operation, to create a
selective band-pass filtering effect. This design preserves meaningful
high-frequency content while capturing critical features and suppressing noise,
achieving a better balance for event-based data processing. Our approach
demonstrates competitive results on event-based datasets for both
classification and object detection tasks while significantly reducing training
and inference time by up to 42.5% and 32.8%, respectively.

### [3] [Enhancing the Quality of 3D Lunar Maps Using JAXA's Kaguya Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11817)
*Yumi Iwashita,Haakon Moe,Yang Cheng,Adnan Ansar,Georgios Georgakis,Adrian Stoica,Kazuto Nakashima,Ryo Kurazume,Jim Torresen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种改进Kaguya TC图像生成3D月球地图质量的方法，重点解决压缩引起的视差图噪声问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着月球探索任务增加，需要高质量3D月球地图，特别是长距离任务如NASA的Endurance任务。Kaguya TC图像虽然全球覆盖，但存在立体匹配误差和JPEG压缩伪影导致的海拔不准确问题

Method: 分析Kaguya TC图像的压缩行为，识别系统性视差噪声模式（特别是在暗区），提出通过减少压缩图像视差图中的残留噪声来增强3D地图质量的方法

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法有效减少了高程噪声

Conclusion: 该方法提高了地形数据的安全性和可靠性，对未来月球任务具有重要意义

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [4] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过控制实验比较CLIP和DINO作为视觉编码器的表现，发现CLIP在文本密集型任务中表现更好，而DINO在视觉中心任务中略胜一筹，揭示了语言监督对视觉编码器性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于自监督模型DINO的原因，是源于语言监督还是更大的训练数据，通过控制变量实验来解耦这两个因素。

Method: 在相同架构、数据集和训练配置下预训练CLIP和DINO，使其达到相似的ImageNet准确率，然后分析嵌入特征并集成到视觉语言模型中进行20个VQA基准测试。

Result: CLIP捕捉高层次语义（如对象类别、文本），DINO对低层特征（如颜色、风格）更敏感；在VQA任务中，CLIP在文本密集型任务中表现优异，DINO在视觉中心任务中略优；语言监督变体带来的增益有限。

Conclusion: 研究为视觉编码器设计及其对视觉语言模型性能影响提供了科学见解，强调了语言监督在特定任务中的重要性。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在通用领域已成功应用于视觉编码器训练，但在医学影像中由于数据有限和领域特定偏差而未被充分利用。

Method: 提出乳腺组织感知数据增强采样器用于图像级和补丁级监督，以及利用3D数字乳腺断层合成结构的跨切片对比学习目标。

Result: 在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中达到最先进性能，并在五个基准数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为乳腺X线摄影的多用途计算机辅助诊断工具提供了可扩展、无需标注的基础，有助于减轻放射科医生的工作负担并提高乳腺癌筛查的诊断效率。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通视频安全分析需要细粒度行为模式识别和全面描述生成，现有方法在处理captioning和VQA任务时存在任务干扰问题。

Method: 采用双模型框架，VideoLLaMA专门负责captioning任务，Qwen2.5-VL专门负责VQA任务，通过分离训练策略使每个模型更有效地专业化。

Result: VideoLLaMA在时间推理上表现优异(CIDEr=1.1001)，Qwen2.5-VL在视觉理解上表现突出(VQA准确率60.80%)，在AI City Challenge Track 2中S2得分45.7572，排名第10。

Conclusion: 分离训练策略优于联合训练，VQA准确率提升8.6%且保持captioning质量，证明了任务专业化在复杂视频理解中的有效性。

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PanoTPS-Net模型，通过CNN和TPS空间变换从单张全景图像估计3D房间布局，能有效处理立方体和非立方体布局


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计房间3D布局在计算机视觉中很重要，可用于机器人、增强现实和室内设计等领域

Method: 两阶段架构：1) CNN提取特征并学习TPS变换参数；2) TPS空间变换层基于预测参数将参考布局变形为目标布局

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优异，3DIoU值分别为：PanoContext 85.49、Stanford-2D3D 86.16、Matterport3DLayout 81.76、ZInD 91.98

Conclusion: 模型在房间布局估计中准确度高，TPS变换与全景图像兼容性好，能稳健处理立方体和非立方体布局

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

*Tanner Muturi,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Neema Jakisa Owor,Richard Dyzinela,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于仓库环境空间推理的专用框架，通过在输入提示中嵌入边界框坐标来增强空间理解，在AI City Challenge Track 3中获得了第4名的成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言系统在大规模3D仓库环境中面临场景杂乱、遮挡和需要精确空间理解的挑战，缺乏显式的空间基础，泛化能力不足。

Method: 在输入提示中嵌入掩码维度（边界框坐标），使模型能够推理对象几何和布局；针对四个问题类别进行微调：距离估计、对象计数、多选基础和空间关系推理；在训练集中向GPT响应添加规范化答案以提高一致性。

Result: 最终得分73.0606，在公共排行榜上排名第4。

Conclusion: 结构化提示丰富和针对性优化在推进现实工业环境空间推理方面是有效的。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [9] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略在医学影像中的可解释性，发现DINO结合Grad-CAM能提供最忠实和局部化的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中，模型决策的可解释性直接影响临床信任和采用。Vision Transformers虽然性能优异，但其复杂的注意力机制给可解释性带来挑战。

Method: 使用Gradient Attention Rollout和Grad-CAM评估ViT、DeiT、DINO和Swin Transformer等不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略，在血细胞分类和乳腺超声图像分类任务上进行定量和定性分析。

Result: DINO结合Grad-CAM在所有数据集中提供最忠实和局部化的解释。Grad-CAM始终产生类别区分性和空间精确的热力图，而Gradient Attention Rollout产生更分散的激活。即使在误分类情况下，DINO与Grad-CAM也能突出显示误导模型的临床相关形态特征。

Conclusion: 通过提高模型透明度，这项研究支持将Vision Transformers可靠且可解释地集成到关键的医学诊断工作流程中。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了APGNet网络，通过自适应先验引导机制解决水下伪装目标检测问题，在MAS数据集上优于15种现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像存在退化问题（低对比度、颜色失真）和海洋生物自然伪装，传统图像增强技术难以恢复关键特征，陆地场景的伪装目标检测方法无法适应水下光学特性

Method: 使用MSRCR算法进行数据增强生成光照不变图像；设计扩展感受野模块和多尺度渐进解码器捕获多尺度上下文信息；提出自适应先验引导机制，在高层特征嵌入空间注意力进行粗定位，在低层特征使用可变形卷积细化轮廓

Result: 在两个公共MAS数据集上的广泛实验表明，APGNet在常用评估指标上优于15种最先进方法

Conclusion: APGNet通过集成孪生架构和先验引导机制，有效解决了水下伪装目标检测的挑战，提高了鲁棒性和检测精度

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的视频编辑方法在结构保持任务上表现良好，但在结构可变编辑中存在时间不一致、主体身份漂移和需要人工干预等问题。

Method: 利用姿态和位置先验从源视频学习通用运动表示，实现运动保持的视频编辑。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VidMP3能够有效解决视频编辑中的运动保持问题，支持结构和语义的灵活编辑。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Conclusion: 领域自适应是解决计算机视觉中标注数据稀缺问题的有效方法

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

### [15] [An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098)
*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对QR码去模糊的自适应双网络方法，包括用于严重模糊的EG-Restormer和用于轻度模糊的LENet，通过EGAB模块显式嵌入边缘先验，显著提升解码率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法很少显式利用QR码高度结构化的边缘模式先验，而QR码去模糊的关键是确保成功解码而非感知质量。

Method: 提出EGAB模块将显式边缘先验嵌入Transformer架构，基于此开发EG-Restormer处理严重模糊，LENet处理轻度模糊，并集成到ADNet中根据模糊程度自适应选择网络。

Result: EG-Restormer和ADNet在严重模糊QR码上实现了最先进的解码性能，同时保持有竞争力的速度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式利用QR码的结构化边缘先验，有效提升了去模糊后的解码成功率，特别适合资源受限的移动设备应用。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用平面结构生成精确深度图的方法，通过几何引导改进3D场景重建，特别是在未观察区域，显著提升了重建质量和多视角一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏可靠的几何监督，难以在观察区域和未观察区域产生高质量重建，且缺乏有效机制来缓解生成图像中的多视角不一致问题。

Method: 利用平面结构生成精确度量尺度深度图，通过几何引导改进可见性掩码估计、指导新视角选择，并在使用视频扩散模型修复时增强多视角一致性。

Result: 在Replica、ScanNet++和DeepBlending数据集上的实验表明，该方法在几何和外观重建方面均优于现有基线方法，特别是在未观察区域。

Conclusion: 该方法支持单视图输入和无姿态视频，在室内外场景中具有强大的泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

*Jiawei Zhan,Jun Liu,Jinlong Peng,Xiaochen Chen,Bin-Bin Gao,Yong Liu,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DRL框架解决非排练类增量学习中的三个难题：模型复杂度增长、表示空间不连续变化、局部优化与全局推理不一致。通过轻量级IPA适配器和解耦锚点监督实现高效且有效的增量学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在类增量学习中面临的三个核心挑战：模型复杂度随增量阶段增长、表示空间在不同阶段间不连续变化、阶段局部优化与全局推理之间的不一致性。

Method: 1. 增量并行适配器(IPA)：在PTM基础上学习轻量级适配器，通过传输门实现与当前模型的并行连接，保证表示空间的平滑转移；2. 解耦锚点监督(DAS)：通过虚拟锚点分别约束正负样本，促进判别性表示学习并对齐不同阶段特征空间。

Result: 在六个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DRL在整个CIL过程中持续优于其他最先进方法，同时在训练和推理阶段都保持高效率。

Conclusion: DRL框架通过IPA适配器和DAS监督机制，有效解决了类增量学习中的关键挑战，实现了高效且性能优越的增量学习能力。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

TL;DR: SSDiff是一种自监督选择性引导扩散方法，用于老照片人脸修复，通过伪参考人脸实现区域特异性修复，在结构引导和颜色细化方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决老照片人脸修复中存在的复合退化问题，如破损、褪色和严重模糊，现有方法在处理局部伪影或人脸颜色方面存在困难。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型在弱引导下生成伪参考人脸，通过人脸解析图和划痕掩码选择性修复破损区域，采用分阶段监督：结构引导贯穿去噪过程，颜色细化在后期步骤进行。

Result: 在构建的VintageFace基准测试中，SSDiff在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面优于现有的GAN和扩散方法。

Conclusion: SSDiff通过自监督选择性引导扩散方法有效解决了老照片人脸修复的挑战，在多个评估指标上表现优异。

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强图像生成系统的广泛采用引发了未经授权使用私有图像数据集的担忧，传统数字水印方法在该系统中存在局限性

Method: 利用视觉语言模型合成与原始数据集视觉一致的哨兵图像，通过随机生成的字符序列作为检索密钥进行保护验证

Result: 实验结果表明ImageSentinel能有效检测未经授权的数据集使用，同时保持授权应用的生成质量

Conclusion: ImageSentinel为解决RAIG系统中视觉数据集保护问题提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于压缩单光子3D成像的约束优化方法，通过梯度下降联合优化照明和编码矩阵，在硬件约束下提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单光子相机在飞行时间3D成像中面临硬件限制（系统带宽、激光功率、传感器数据速率等），现有压缩直方图方法在真实世界照明硬件约束下表现不佳。

Method: 采用约束优化方法，通过梯度下降联合优化照明和编码矩阵，确保设计符合硬件约束条件。

Result: 在广泛模拟中，该方法在带宽和峰值功率约束下始终优于传统编码设计，特别是在峰值功率受限系统中优势明显，并能适应任意参数化脉冲响应。

Conclusion: 该方法为压缩单光子3D成像提供了实用的编码函数设计，能够有效应对真实世界的硬件约束挑战。

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Conclusion: CapFlow和MetaCaptioner为未来多模态研究提供了强大且成本效益高的视觉描述解决方案，有望推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Conclusion: FedHUG框架有效解决了联邦学习环境下的无监督域泛化问题，为隐私保护的远程生理测量提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

Motivation: 现有CTTA方法通过恢复初始模型或重用历史模型来减少灾难性遗忘，但通常伴随新知识学习不足和有害历史知识干扰，导致性能严重下降。

Method: 提出类感知领域知识融合与分裂方法KFF，包含知识分裂模块(KFI)从配对类感知域提示池中分离新领域知识，以及知识融合模块(KFU)将分裂的新知识以最小成本合并到现有知识池中。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上的大量实验验证了所提方法相对于其他方法的有效性。

Conclusion: KFF方法通过自适应扩展和合并类感知领域知识，能够动态积累判别性历史知识，有效解决持续测试时适应中的知识学习与遗忘问题。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL)框架，通过扩散模型将单样本原型建模为概率分布，生成多样化原型变体，解决医学图像分割中标注数据有限和解剖变异大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于原型的单样本分割方法使用确定性平均特征，无法捕捉类内多样性，导致泛化能力差。需要一种能从小样本中学习多样化原型表示的方法。

Method: DPL包含三个核心创新：扩散原型增强模块通过前向-反向扩散过程生成原型变体；空间感知条件机制利用原型特征统计的几何属性；保守融合策略在保持原型保真度的同时最大化表示多样性。

Result: 在腹部MRI和CT数据集上的广泛实验显示显著改进，建立了单样本医学图像分割的最新性能水平。

Conclusion: DPL通过将原型构建重新表述为基于扩散的特征空间探索，有效解决了单样本医学图像分割中的原型表示挑战，实现了更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练状态空间模型在视频分类中虽然效率高，但顺序压缩的视觉提示令牌无法有效捕获视频的时空上下文信息，限制了空间和时间信息的传播。

Method: 设计了帧内聚集（IFG）模块来聚合每帧内的空间关键信息，以及帧间传播（IFS）模块来传播不同帧间的判别性时空信息，通过自适应平衡和压缩帧内和帧间的关键时空信息来有效传播判别性信息。

Result: 在四个视频基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，SSP方法平均比现有SOTA方法提升了2.76%，同时减少了微调参数的开销。

Conclusion: SSP方法通过有效聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息，显著提升了视频理解性能，同时保持了参数效率。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and

on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEEP3D提出了一种端到端的3D实例分割方法，使用边界框标注作为弱监督信号，通过师生框架生成伪掩码，避免了传统两阶段方法的复杂性和训练时间问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全监督的3D实例分割需要密集的点级标注，成本高昂。边界框标注虽然更易获取，但在重叠区域存在模糊性。现有两阶段方法增加了训练复杂性和时间，需要端到端的解决方案。

Method: 采用师生框架，教师模型作为伪标签生成器，通过指数移动平均更新。引入基于实例中心的查询精化来提升定位精度，并设计了查询一致性损失和掩码特征一致性损失来对齐预测与伪掩码的语义和几何信号。

Conclusion: BEEP3D提供了一种有效的端到端解决方案，能够在降低标注成本的同时实现高质量的3D实例分割，为弱监督3D场景理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: CompoDistill通过注意力对齐有效解决了MLLM知识蒸馏中的视觉感知能力传递问题，具有良好的通用性。

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Conclusion: 基于视觉语言模型的分层推理是事故分析和更广泛理解安全关键交通事件的有前景方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

*Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Luu Tu Nguyen,Thi Bich Phuong Man,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DIANet双流框架，利用相位感知动态图像分别编码微表情的起始到顶点和顶点到结束阶段，通过交叉注意力融合模块整合特征，在三个基准数据集上优于传统单相位方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临面部线索细微短暂和标注数据有限的挑战。传统动态图像方法忽略了微表情不同时间阶段的独特特征，需要更精细的相位建模。

Method: DIANet双流框架：一个流编码起始到顶点阶段，另一个流捕获顶点到结束阶段。每个流使用专用CNN处理，通过交叉注意力融合模块自适应整合特征。

Result: 在CASME-II、SAMM和MMEW三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法持续优于传统单相位动态图像方法。

Conclusion: 明确建模时间相位信息对微表情识别至关重要，为推进MER提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在推理任务上表现出色，但构建高性能推理训练数据集的原则仍不清楚。本文旨在探索数据整理策略对VL推理能力的影响。

Method: 通过控制训练和评估设置，分析上下文来源的影响，实施有针对性的数据干预（如图像描述辅助信号、纯文本推理），并探索图像、问题和思维链解决方案的规模化扩展。

Result: 研究发现：上下文来源策略显著影响VLM性能；数据干预带来显著收益；扩展所有数据维度持续提升推理能力。基于此构建的HoneyBee数据集使3B参数模型在MathVerse上超越SOTA模型7.8%，基础模型24.8%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了改进的视觉语言推理数据集整理策略，通过大规模高质量数据集和测试时缩放策略，显著提升了模型性能并降低了推理成本。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

Motivation: 当前图像和视频生成模型面临推理效率挑战，多token并行预测虽然能大幅减少推理时间，但容易因token不兼容导致结构不一致，且传统方法无法回溯修正错误预测。

Method: 采用新颖的训练方案，在上下文中注入随机token以增强鲁棒性，并在采样过程中实现token修正，保持并行token预测效率的同时提升生成质量。

Conclusion: 该方法成功平衡了生成效率与质量，为高效图像和视频生成提供了可行的解决方案，在保持并行预测速度优势的同时显著提升了生成结果的准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Motivation: 解决红外小目标检测中跨域偏移和异方差噪声扰动的双重挑战，提升模型在真实应用场景中的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 小波引导的跨域合成生成目标域对齐的训练样本；2) 真实域噪声不变性学习，从目标域提取真实噪声特征构建动态噪声库，通过自监督损失学习噪声不变性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个定量指标上优于现有最先进方法，在跨域场景中表现出优异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ivan-ISTD框架有效解决了红外小目标检测中的跨域和噪声问题，创建了Dynamic-ISTD基准数据集，验证了方法的通用性。

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用时空一致的代理节点来表示视频中动态变化的对象/场景，克服传统像素级匹配和跟踪的不稳定性，支持复杂视频处理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频表示严重依赖不稳定且过于细粒度的运动和外观建模先验，如像素级匹配和跟踪。跟踪误差、遮挡和大运动会破坏视觉对象表示。

Method: 使用分层代理节点稳定表达视觉对象的多尺度结构，通过动态表示更新机制利用视频时空先验，并采用形状和纹理表示的分离编码方式。

Result: 实验表明该方法以更少参数实现高视频重建精度，支持视频修复和基于关键帧的时间一致性视频编辑等复杂任务。

Conclusion: 代理节点表示能够稳定处理跟踪误差、长期运动、遮挡和视角变化，同时提供可控的细粒度外观编辑能力。

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新型损失函数：乘法损失和置信度自适应乘法损失，用于医学和细胞图像的语义分割，在数据稀缺情况下表现优于传统损失函数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像面临数据稀缺问题（隐私、伦理、标注成本高），而常用的交叉熵和Dice损失的加法组合对超参数敏感且性能不佳，需要更鲁棒高效的训练目标

Method: 将交叉熵和Dice损失进行乘法组合，基于预测置信度动态调节梯度；置信度自适应版本进一步引入置信度驱动的指数缩放，强调困难样本

Result: 在细胞和医学分割基准测试中，该框架始终优于调优后的加法损失和现有损失函数

Conclusion: 该框架为在数据限制挑战下实现鲁棒分割提供了一种简单、有效且无需超参数调优的机制

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Motivation: 解决神经网络对OOD数据产生过度自信预测的问题，避免传统方法需要额外OOD数据集或生成伪OOD图像的高成本限制。

Method: 从ID图像中提取背景特征作为模拟的OOD视觉表示，基于卷积的局部不变性，通过优化降低这些背景特征的L2范数来训练模型。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效且低成本的OOD检测解决方案，能够显著缓解模型对OOD数据的过度自信问题。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Conclusion: AngularFuse框架通过同时考虑梯度幅度和方向，能够生成纹理强度保持良好且边缘方向正确的融合图像，展现出优越的融合能力。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

Conclusion: SpineBench揭示了当前MLLM在脊柱医学应用中的不足，为未来改进提供了指导方向。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

Motivation: 解决现有动态3D城市场景重建方法在保真度和计算成本之间的权衡问题，这些方法语义无关的设计导致资源分配不均

Method: 引入语义引导的剪枝和正则化策略，以及基于优先级的渲染流水线，通过混合重要性度量和深度预传递来优化资源分配

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现卓越的重建质量，特别是在安全关键对象上，同时显著减少训练时间并将渲染速度提升至350+ FPS

Conclusion: PAGS通过注入任务感知语义优先级，成功解决了动态3D重建中保真度与效率的权衡问题

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

TL;DR: 提出了DL-DKD++框架，通过动态知识蒸馏从大规模视觉语言预训练模型向轻量级PRVR网络迁移知识，解决部分相关视频检索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索方法假设视频经过预剪辑且仅包含文本相关内容，但实际中视频通常是未剪辑的长视频，包含更复杂的背景内容，因此需要处理部分相关视频检索这一更具挑战性的任务。

Method: 采用双学习框架与动态知识蒸馏，包含大型教师模型和紧凑的双分支学生网络。学生网络包括继承分支（吸收教师模型的可迁移知识）和探索分支（学习PRVR数据集的特定任务信息）。引入动态软目标构建机制，用自适应软目标替代硬目标监督。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet和Charades-STA数据集上的实验结果表明，所提模型在PRVR任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DL-DKD++框架通过动态知识蒸馏有效解决了部分相关视频检索问题，在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文研究了视觉语言模型(VLMs)在无文字logo上的品牌名称幻觉问题，发现模型倾向于依赖符号先验而非真实字形感知，并通过投影器维度分析提出了缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面取得显著进展，但仍然容易产生幻觉输出，特别是在logo识别中会生成不基于视觉证据的品牌名称或文本内容。

Method: 使用纯符号、混合和含文字logo的精选数据集，以及Hard-60子集，系统测量领先VLMs的幻觉现象；通过九种结构化扰动测试鲁棒性；对开源LLaVA进行嵌入级分析，识别与幻觉相关的投影器维度。

Result: 幻觉现象在强失真下仍然存在，遮挡暴露了最严重弱点；幻觉与投影器的小部分维度相关，针对性消融可显著减少错误同时保持OCR准确性；VLMs对标志性圆形logo特别依赖符号先验。

Conclusion: 投影器子空间在幻觉失败模式中起决定性作用，投影器解耦和OCR引导解码是构建更可信多模态系统的有前景方向。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Motivation: 解决街景新视角合成挑战，从车辆中心视角的训练轨迹生成不同轨迹（如不同车道或方向）的渲染图像。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 使用高斯泼溅进行3D场景重建并渲染目标相机视角；2) 使用专用单步扩散模型增强生成帧的质量。

Result: 在公开测试排行榜上获得综合得分0.432，总体排名第二。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合3D重建和生成增强在街景新视角合成任务中表现优异，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于单目图像的SSC方法缺乏显式运动推理，难以处理遮挡和噪声深度监督问题。

Method: 结合光流时序对齐与课程学习深度融合，使用多级融合策略对齐跨帧特征，并通过课程学习从稀疏LiDAR深度逐步过渡到密集立体深度。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI基准上达到16.9 mIoU，验证了运动引导和课程感知设计的有效性。

Conclusion: CurriFlow通过运动引导和课程感知设计，为基于相机的3D语义场景补全提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

TL;DR: 提出一种可学习的自适应子采样框架，通过注意力引导的动态采样机制减少深度神经网络的计算复杂度，特别适用于3D医学影像和超声视频分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络性能提升往往伴随计算复杂度增加，而3D体积或视频数据中存在冗余，并非所有切片或帧都必要。现有方法缺乏输入自适应性，采样机制在训练后保持静态，无法适应不同输入。

Method: 设计注意力引导的采样模块，克服子采样不可微问题，实现输入自适应采样。该框架可集成到任何神经网络架构中，在推理时也能动态调整采样策略。

Result: 在MedMNIST3D医学影像数据集和两个超声视频数据集（包括真实临床条件下收集的具有挑战性的内部数据集）上验证了方法的有效性，实现了性能提升和复杂度降低。

Conclusion: 提出的注意力引导自适应采样框架能够有效减少深度神经网络的计算负担，同时保持或提升性能，特别适用于存在数据冗余的3D和视频分类任务。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了STORM-PSR双流框架，通过结合空间和时间特征来改进过程步骤识别，特别针对部分遮挡情况下的鲁棒性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进模型仅依赖检测单个视频帧中的装配对象状态，忽略了时间特征，导致在物体部分遮挡时模型鲁棒性和准确性受限。

Method: STORM-PSR采用双流框架：装配状态检测流处理无遮挡对象视图，时空流通过空间编码器和基于transformer的时间编码器捕获时空特征，即使在部分遮挡下也能识别步骤完成。

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上评估，相比先前方法，将实际和预测装配步骤完成之间的平均延迟分别减少了11.2%和26.1%。

Conclusion: STORM-PSR通过时空流显著提升了过程步骤识别的性能，该流不依赖无遮挡对象视图来推断已完成的步骤。

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

Motivation: 当训练图像缺乏足够多视角约束时，现有的场景坐标回归模型会退化，需要引入先验知识来改善这一问题。

Method: 将场景坐标回归模型训练重新解释为概率问题，引入从简单深度分布先验到基于大规模室内扫描数据训练的3D点云扩散模型等多种先验，在训练过程中将预测的3D场景点推向更合理的几何结构。

Result: 在三个室内数据集上，该方法能够学习到更好的场景表示，产生更连贯的场景点云、更高的配准率和更好的相机位姿，对下游任务如新视角合成和相机重定位有积极影响。

Conclusion: 通过概率化重新解释和引入高级重建先验，可以有效改善场景坐标回归模型在训练数据约束不足时的性能退化问题，提升场景表示质量和下游任务表现。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI虽然成本低且便携，但信噪比低、诊断质量差，需要在不增加昂贵基础设施的情况下提升图像质量

Method: 使用条件流匹配方法，通过直接回归最优速度场来学习噪声分布到目标数据分布的连续流，避免传统生成模型的迭代采样或对抗目标

Result: CFM在低场MRI重建中达到最先进性能，对分布内和分布外数据都具有鲁棒性，且参数数量显著少于竞争方法

Conclusion: CFM是MRI重建的强大可扩展工具，特别适用于资源有限的临床环境

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

TL;DR: VideoLucy是一个基于深度记忆回溯的长视频理解框架，通过分层记忆结构和迭代回溯机制解决现有方法在时间上下文理解和关键信息保留方面的不足。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体系统在长视频理解中存在两个主要问题：1）在单帧上进行建模和推理，难以捕捉连续帧的时间上下文；2）采用稀疏帧采样来降低密集帧标注成本，但可能丢失关键信息。

Method: 提出VideoLucy框架，受人类从粗到细的回忆过程启发，采用分层记忆结构，明确定义不同层次深度的记忆细节水平和时间范围。通过基于智能体的迭代回溯机制，系统性地挖掘视频范围内与问题相关的深度记忆，直到收集到足够信息来提供可靠答案。

Conclusion: VideoLucy通过深度记忆回溯框架有效解决了长视频理解中的时间上下文理解和关键信息保留问题，在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Method: 第一阶段使用双流攻击模块：MNTD-PGD针对小扰动预算优化梯度计算，SG-PGD聚焦于视觉显著区域的扰动；第二阶段通过度量感知选择模块基于攻击成功率和结构相似性评估候选样本。

Result: 相比最先进的攻击方法，MS-GAGA在未见检测器上实现了高达27%更高的误分类率。

Conclusion: MS-GAGA通过两阶段设计和联合优化策略，有效提升了对抗样本在黑盒深度伪造检测器上的转移性和视觉不可察觉性。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly

Conclusion: BSGS框架能够有效解决运动模糊图像中的3D场景重建问题，通过双阶段优化和梯度聚合策略显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于分数扩散模型的人体运动生成方法，仅通过特征空间归一化和分析推导的损失权重，就能达到最先进的无条件运动生成效果，同时直接生成运动和形状，避免了缓慢的关节形状恢复过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体运动生成方法（如VAE、GAN、扩散模型）通常依赖过度参数化的输入特征和辅助损失来提升效果，但这些策略对于扩散模型来说并非必需。本文旨在证明通过精心设计的特征归一化和损失权重，扩散模型就能有效匹配人体运动分布。

Method: 采用基于分数的扩散模型，仅使用特征空间归一化和分析推导的L2分数匹配损失权重，直接生成运动和形状，避免了后处理形状恢复。方法逐步构建，每个组件都有明确的理论动机。

Result: 在无条件人体运动生成任务上达到了与最先进方法相当的结果，同时能够直接生成运动和形状，提高了效率。

Conclusion: 证明了精心设计的特征归一化和损失权重足以让扩散模型在人体运动生成任务上取得优异表现，无需复杂的辅助策略，同时实现了运动和形状的端到端生成。

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

TL;DR: 提出了CoIRL-AD框架，通过竞争机制结合模仿学习和强化学习，在自动驾驶任务中实现更好的泛化能力和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模仿学习在自动驾驶中泛化能力差，而强化学习存在样本效率低和收敛不稳定问题，需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 采用竞争性双策略框架，让IL和RL智能体在训练过程中交互，通过竞争机制促进知识交换并避免梯度冲突。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上实验显示碰撞率降低18%，在长尾场景中表现出更强的泛化能力和性能提升。

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD框架有效结合了IL和RL的优势，超越了传统的两阶段训练范式，在自动驾驶任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个无人机多光谱多目标跟踪基准MMOT，包含大规模数据集和新的多光谱方向感知跟踪方案，显著提升了小目标和密集场景的跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于无人机的多目标跟踪中因小目标、严重遮挡和杂乱背景带来的挑战，现有RGB跟踪算法依赖的空间外观线索在航拍视角下可靠性下降，而多光谱图像能提供增强目标区分度的光谱反射信息。

Method: 提出多光谱方向感知MOT方案：1) 轻量级Spectral 3D-Stem集成光谱特征并保持RGB预训练兼容性；2) 方向感知卡尔曼滤波器进行精确状态估计；3) 端到端方向自适应transformer。

Result: 在代表性跟踪器上的广泛实验表明，多光谱输入相比RGB基线显著提升了跟踪性能，特别是对小目标和密集堆叠物体的跟踪效果改善明显。

Conclusion: MMOT基准和提出的方法将推动无人机多光谱多目标跟踪研究的发展，相关数据集、代码和基准已公开。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出IVT-LR方法，通过隐式视觉-文本潜在推理解决多模态推理中的标注成本和推理延迟问题，在精度提升5.45%的同时实现5倍以上的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理方法依赖显式推理步骤，需要大量视觉-文本标注且引入显著推理延迟，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出IVT-LR方法，在潜在空间中结合潜在文本（前一步隐藏状态）和潜在视觉（选定图像嵌入）来表示推理步骤，采用渐进多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在M3CoT和ScienceQA数据集上，IVT-LR方法平均准确率提升5.45%，同时推理速度比现有方法快5倍以上。

Conclusion: IVT-LR通过潜在空间推理有效解决了多模态推理中的标注成本和延迟问题，实现了精度和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖交叉注意力机制融合条件和运动，但这种方法主要捕捉全局交互，难以保持逐步的时间对齐。

Method: 引入时序条件Mamba模型，将条件信息整合到Mamba块的循环动态中，实现更好的时间对齐运动生成。

Result: 在多种人体运动任务上的实验表明，该方法在时间对齐、运动真实性和条件一致性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的时序条件Mamba模型能够有效解决基于时间相关输入信号的人体运动生成任务中的时间对齐问题。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

TL;DR: 提出H-EGL框架，结合自监督和人工指导约束，提升医学影像中Transformer模型的注意力对齐和泛化能力，在胸部X光分类任务上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在医学影像中易学习虚假相关性，导致偏见和泛化能力受限，而人工-AI注意力对齐需要昂贵的监督成本。

Method: H-EGL框架结合自监督和人工指导约束，自监督组件利用类别区分性注意力，不依赖限制性先验，增强鲁棒性和灵活性。

Result: 在胸部X光分类任务中，H-EGL优于两种最先进的EGL方法，展现出更好的分类准确率和泛化能力，注意力图与人类专家知识更一致。

Conclusion: H-EGL框架有效提升了医学影像中Transformer模型的注意力对齐和泛化性能，无需昂贵的人工监督。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

TL;DR: 提出一种零样本农业图像分割方法，结合Plantnet植物分类模型、DinoV2骨干网络和Segment Anything Model (SAM)，无需收集新数据集即可实现植物区域分割。


<details>

Motivation: 解决农业图像分割中数据标注瓶颈问题，利用现有植物专用模型避免重新收集和标注数据集，适应复杂田间条件下的分割需求。

Method: 利用Plantnet的植物专用表示识别植物区域生成粗分割掩码，然后通过SAM进行精细化分割，结合Plantnet微调的DinoV2模型。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的评估显示，使用Plantnet微调的DinoV2相比基础DinoV2模型在Jaccard指数(IoU)上获得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型和植物专用模型可以有效缓解标注瓶颈，在多样化农业场景中实现有效的分割。

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

TL;DR: IRIS是一个评估多模态大语言模型在"与图像一起思考"范式下能力的基准，包含1204个跨5个领域的视觉任务，结果显示当前模型在整合视觉和通用工具方面表现不佳，最强模型仅达到18.68%通过率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准大多遵循"关于图像思考"的范式，将图像视为静态输入，而实际应用中用户提供的图像往往不完美，需要主动的图像操作来发现关键视觉线索。MLLMs需要能够动态转换视觉内容并与其他工具集成来解决复杂任务。

Method: 引入IRIS基准，包含1204个具有挑战性的开放式视觉任务（603个单轮，601个多轮），涵盖5个不同领域，每个任务都配有详细的评分标准以进行系统评估。

Result: 评估显示当前MLLMs在需要有效整合视觉和通用工具的任务上表现不佳，即使最强的GPT-5-think模型也仅达到18.68%的通过率。不同模型展现出不同的工具使用行为，OpenAI模型受益于多样化的图像操作，而Gemini-2.5-pro则没有改善。

Conclusion: IRIS作为首个专注于"与图像一起思考"的基准，为推进MLLMs的视觉智能提供了关键见解，揭示了当前模型在动态视觉推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

TL;DR: LayerSync是一种领域无关的方法，通过利用扩散模型自身中间表征的正则化来提高生成质量和训练效率，无需外部监督或预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明扩散模型的生成质量与学习到的表征相关，外部指导可以加速训练。本文重新思考这一范式，探索如何利用模型自身的中间表征进行正则化。

Method: 基于不同层表征质量存在差异的观察，让语义丰富的表征作为内在指导来正则化较弱表征。LayerSync是一种即插即用的自监督正则化项，不增加训练开销。

Result: 在图像生成上广泛评估，并扩展到音频、视频和运动生成等领域。例如，在ImageNet数据集上加速基于流的transformer训练8.75倍，生成质量提升23.6%。

Conclusion: LayerSync是一种通用、自给自足的正则化方法，能一致地提高扩散模型的生成质量和训练效率，适用于多种模态。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了VQArt-Bench，一个用于文化遗产领域的大规模视觉问答基准，通过多智能体管道生成复杂、多样的问题，评估多模态大语言模型在视觉艺术分析中的深层语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉问答基准在评估深层语义理解方面存在不足，特别是在视觉艺术分析等复杂领域。这些问题局限于简单句法结构和表面属性，无法捕捉人类视觉查询的多样性和深度，导致模型利用统计捷径而非进行视觉推理。

Method: 使用新颖的多智能体管道，让专门化的智能体协作生成经过验证的、语言多样且细致的问题，构建了一个结构化的基准，沿着相关视觉理解维度来探测模型解释符号意义、叙事和复杂视觉关系的能力。

Result: 对14个最先进的多模态大语言模型进行评估，揭示了当前模型的显著局限性，包括在简单计数任务中的意外弱点，以及专有模型和开源模型之间的明显性能差距。

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench基准填补了现有评估方法的空白，突显了当前多模态大语言模型在复杂视觉艺术理解方面的不足，为未来模型开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

Motivation: 像素空间生成模型通常比潜在空间模型更难训练且性能较差，存在持续的效率和性能差距。

Method: 两阶段训练框架：第一阶段预训练编码器捕获干净图像的语义信息并与确定性采样轨迹对齐；第二阶段将编码器与随机初始化解码器集成，对完整模型进行端到端微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上扩散模型达到FID 2.04，ImageNet-512上达到FID 2.35（75次函数评估）；一致性模型在单步采样中达到FID 8.82，显著超越潜在空间对应模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个成功直接在高分辨率图像上训练一致性模型的方法，无需依赖预训练的VAE或扩散模型，在生成质量和效率方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的动态高斯泼溅模型对所有高斯基元进行统一优化，忽略了它们是否被良好观测，导致在遮挡下出现运动漂移和在未见视角下合成质量下降。

Method: 引入时间变化的每个高斯不确定性估计，构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化，将可靠的运动线索传播到整个4D重建过程中。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，显式建模不确定性持续改进动态高斯泼溅模型，在遮挡下产生更稳定的几何结构，在极端视角下实现高质量合成。

Conclusion: 不确定性建模对于动态高斯泼溅至关重要，USplat4D通过不确定性感知优化显著提升了4D重建的稳定性和质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

<details>

Motivation: 传统创建逼真数字人虚拟形象的过程昂贵耗时，需要大型相机捕捉设备和专业3D艺术家。现有基于单张图像的方法虽然降低了门槛，但缺乏多视角信息约束，导致视角偏离时质量下降。

Method: 基于预训练的视频扩散模型，从单张参考图像和目标表情同时生成数百帧多视角视频，视角变化可达360度，然后将输出蒸馏成可实时渲染的4D虚拟形象。

Result: 相比之前的方法，显著提高了生成虚拟形象的逼真度、时间一致性和3D一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持易用性的同时，通过多视角视频生成和4D蒸馏技术，显著提升了数字人虚拟形象的视觉质量和3D一致性。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

Motivation: 现有方法往往忽略水下成像的物理原理，或简单将水下图像退化现象视为干扰因素，未能充分利用其中包含的有价值信息。

Method: 基于整流流的框架，将水下物理成像信息作为显式先验直接融入网络训练过程，并引入时间维度建模。

Result: 在USOD10K数据集上，WaterFlow在S_m指标上获得了0.072的提升。

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

*Kevin Li,Manuel Brack,Sudeep Katakol,Hareesh Ravi,Ajinkya Kale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFusion是一个基于扩散的生成模型，使用冻结的大型视觉语言模型作为统一多模态编码器，通过层注意力池化机制提取文本和视觉token的语义和细节信息，实现了跨模态推理和知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉生成架构通常使用独立的图像和文本编码器，限制了扩散模型的跨模态推理和知识迁移能力。现有方法需要大量计算资源和数据，限制了可访问性。

Method: 提出Layerwise Attention Pooling机制从冻结VLM中提取多层级信息；提出VERIFI方法，在推理时仅使用VLM生成的文本token进行条件生成；通过编辑任务微调实现知识迁移。

Result: LAP在文本-图像对齐方面优于其他浅层融合架构；模型在单图像编辑训练后能够零样本泛化到多图像参考；编辑任务微调不仅改善了生成对齐，还展现了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniFusion的统一编码器设计验证了跨模态知识迁移的有效性，为生成模型提供了更强的推理能力和灵活性。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于跨频一致性的零样本去噪方法ZSCFC，能够在单张噪声图像上训练和去噪，不依赖噪声分布假设，在计算效率和去噪性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本去噪方法训练时间长，且依赖噪声独立性和零均值假设，限制了在真实复杂噪声场景下的有效性。

Method: 利用图像纹理在不同频带具有位置相似性和内容一致性而噪声不具备的特性，开发了跨频一致性损失和超轻量网络实现图像去噪。

Result: 在多个真实世界图像数据集上的实验表明，ZSCFC在计算效率和去噪性能上优于其他最先进的零样本方法。

Conclusion: ZSCFC方法能够有效处理真实世界的复杂噪声，为单图像去噪提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

TL;DR: CuMPerLay是一个可微分的向量化层，将立方多参数持续性（CMP）集成到深度学习管道中，通过分解CMP为可学习的单参数持续性，在医学影像和计算机视觉任务中提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMP为图像拓扑分析提供了强大工具，但由于多过滤结构的复杂性和向量化困难，其应用受到限制。需要一种方法将CMP整合到深度学习框架中。

Method: 提出新算法向量化立方复形的多参数同调，将CMP分解为可学习的单参数持续性组合，联合学习双过滤函数，并确保可微分性。

Result: 在基准医学影像和计算机视觉数据集上，CuMPerLay在分类和分割任务中表现出性能提升，特别是在数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: CuMPerLay为将全局结构信息整合到深度网络中提供了有前景的方向，适用于结构化图像分析。

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了轻量级的人体网格恢复(HMR)和人体姿态估计(HPE)模型，通过利用分层视觉基础模型(VFMs)的早期阶段作为编码器，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的HMR方法依赖大型非分层视觉变换器作为编码器，计算成本高。研究发现分层VFMs的中间阶段能产生与非分层模型相当或更高分辨率的特征图，这为构建更高效的模型提供了机会。

Method: 首先构建了三个轻量级HMR2.0变体作为基线，然后提出使用Swin Transformer、GroupMixFormer和VMamba等分层VFMs的前两个或三个阶段作为编码器，共评估了27个基于分层VFM的HMR和HPE模型。

Result: 仅使用分层VFMs的前两到三个阶段就能达到与全阶段模型相当的性能，且截断模型在准确性和计算效率之间展现出比现有轻量级替代方案更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段足以实现高性能的HMR和HPE任务，这为开发计算效率更高的模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型存在监督不足问题：巨大的模型能力仅由稀疏的低维动作监督，导致其表示能力未被充分利用。

Method: 采用世界建模预测未来图像，为模型提供密集的自监督信号；为两种主要VLA架构分别实现自回归世界模型和扩散世界模型；引入轻量级动作专家解决实时部署的推理延迟。

Result: 在NAVSIM v1/v2基准测试和680倍更大的内部数据集上，DriveVLA-W0显著优于BEV和VLA基线方法，并放大了数据缩放定律，显示随着训练数据集增大性能提升加速。

Conclusion: 世界建模是增强VLA模型的有效训练范式，能够充分利用模型表示能力，提升驾驶智能的泛化性能。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

Motivation: 地球观测卫星产生大量多光谱图像时间序列数据，现有压缩方法存在存储传输挑战，学习型压缩缺乏公开预训练模型，且传统图像编解码器忽略时间冗余，视频编解码器的运动先验无法捕捉静态场景的辐射演化。

Method: 提出了TerraCodec系列算法，包括适应多光谱输入的高效图像变体和利用时间依赖性的时序Transformer模型(TEC-TT)，并引入Latent Repacking方法训练灵活码率的Transformer模型。

Result: 在Sentinel-2数据上，TerraCodec比传统编解码器在同等图像质量下实现3-10倍的压缩率提升，TEC-TT在AllClear基准测试中零样本云修复性能超过现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 专门定制的学习型压缩算法是地球观测领域有前景的方向，代码和模型权重将在宽松许可下发布。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Method: 集成空间感知特征编码器和跨智能体特征集成，引入高度感知特征缩减来紧凑表示场景信息，以及双掩码感知指导机制来自适应选择特征并减少通信开销。

Result: 在两个虚拟数据集（Air-to-Pred-Occ和UAV3D-Occ）和一个真实世界数据集（GauUScene-Occ）上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的准确性，显著优于现有协作方法，同时将通信开销减少到先前方法的一小部分。

Conclusion: 所提出的多无人机协作占用预测框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在保持高精度的同时大幅降低了通信需求，为无人机群协作感知提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

Conclusion: EReLiFM通过证据可靠性感知和残差流匹配有效解决了带噪声标签的开集域泛化问题，为现实应用提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗领域基础模型的联邦微调提供了一种有效的个性化解决方案，能够平衡数据利用和隐私保护的需求。

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: FlashVSR使基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率变得实用，实现了效率、可扩展性和实时性能的平衡，将为高效扩散VSR研究提供有力支持。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

TL;DR: 提出E-MoFlow框架，通过隐式时空和几何正则化联合优化事件相机的自运动和光流估计，无需监督即可实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机中缺乏鲁棒的数据关联使得单独解决自运动和光流估计成为不适定问题，现有方法存在偏差、计算开销或陷入局部最优的问题。

Method: 将相机自运动建模为连续样条，光流建模为隐式神经表示，通过微分几何约束引入结构和运动先验，避免显式深度估计。

Conclusion: E-MoFlow通过隐式正则化统一了自运动和光流估计，为事件相机提供了有效的无监督解决方案。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

Result: 在两个PET扫描仪和四种示踪剂上的评估显示，DL-HMC++优于现有数据驱动方法，生成的无运动图像与黄金标准硬件追踪结果难以区分，区域标准摄取值差异率分别为1.2±0.5%和0.5±0.2%。

Conclusion: DL-HMC++展示了数据驱动PET头部运动校正的潜力，能够消除对硬件运动追踪的依赖，使运动校正技术更广泛地应用于临床环境。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyUp是一种无需特定训练的特征上采样方法，适用于任何视觉特征和分辨率，解决了现有方法需要为每个特征提取器重新训练的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的特征上采样方法（如DINO或CLIP）需要为每个特征提取器重新训练，无法在推理时泛化到不同的特征类型。

Method: 提出了一种推理时的特征无关上采样架构，无需编码器特定训练，可应用于各种视觉特征。

Result: AnyUp在特征上采样方面达到了新的最先进水平，能够泛化到不同的特征类型，保持特征语义，且高效易用于各种下游任务。

Conclusion: AnyUp提供了一种通用、高效的特征上采样解决方案，突破了现有方法需要特定训练的限制。

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个高效感知超分辨率（EPSR）的全面研究和基准测试，旨在在严格效率约束下（最多5M参数和2000 GFLOPs）复制或改进Real-ESRGAN的感知质量结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然高效的PSNR导向超分辨率取得了显著进展，但专注于感知质量指标的方法仍然相对低效，存在这一研究空白。

Method: 在严格效率约束下（最大5M参数和2000 GFLOPs）开发解决方案，并在包含500张4K测试图像的新数据集上进行评估，这些图像使用多种退化类型进行退化处理。

Result: 表现最佳的方法在所有基准数据集上都优于Real-ESRGAN，证明了高效方法在感知领域的潜力。

Conclusion: 本文为高效感知超分辨率建立了现代基准。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

*Stefan Andreas Baumann,Nick Stracke,Timy Phan,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Flow Poke Transformer (FPT)框架，通过稀疏交互预测局部运动分布，提供可解释的多模态场景运动表示，在多个下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常只能密集采样单一场景动态实现，无法有效表示多模态场景运动及其对物理交互的依赖关系。

Method: 使用稀疏交互（称为"pokes"）作为条件，直接预测局部运动分布，提供可解释且可直接访问的多模态场景运动表示。

Result: 在密集面部运动生成任务中，通用预训练模型超越专用基线；在强分布外任务中微调后，在关节物体运动估计上显著优于域内方法；在基于pokes的运动部件分割任务中取得竞争性表现。

Conclusion: FPT框架能够直接预测显式运动分布，展示了其在多种任务中的灵活性和多功能性，为场景动态理解提供了新方法。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

TL;DR: SRUM是一个自奖励后训练框架，通过让统一多模态模型的理解模块作为内部评估器来指导生成模块，实现自我改进，无需额外人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型存在视觉理解能力无法有效迁移到视觉生成的问题，模型能正确理解图像却无法从文本提示生成忠实图像。

Method: 设计了全局-局部双奖励系统：全局奖励确保整体视觉语义和布局的正确性，局部奖励细化细粒度、对象级的保真度。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench上从82.18提升到88.37，在T2I-ReasonBench上从43.82提升到46.75，表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新范式，使统一多模态模型的理解模块能够通过自奖励来指导和增强自身的生成能力。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

### [88] [ViCO: A Training Strategy towards Semantic Aware Dynamic High-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12793)
*Long Cui,Weiyun Wang,Jie Shao,Zichen Wen,Gen Luo,Linfeng Zhang,Yanting Zhang,Yu Qiao,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViCO是一种训练算法，通过视觉一致性学习让多模态大语言模型根据图像语义复杂度自适应调整视觉token数量，减少推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs由于图像输入引入的额外视觉token导致推理成本增加，需要更高效的视觉表示方法。

Method: 使用多个不同压缩率的MLP连接器对视觉token进行下采样，训练时最小化不同连接器响应的KL散度，推理时通过视觉分辨率路由器自动选择压缩率。

Result: 实验表明该方法能减少最多50%的视觉token，同时保持模型的感知、推理和OCR能力。

Conclusion: ViCO方法为开发更高效的MLLMs做出了贡献，代码和模型将开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rex-Omni是一个3B规模的MLLM，通过特殊token表示量化坐标、多数据引擎生成高质量数据以及两阶段训练流程，在零样本设置下实现了与回归模型相当或更优的目标检测性能，并具备多种视觉感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统坐标回归模型主导目标检测，但MLLM方法面临召回率低、重复预测、坐标不对齐等问题。本文旨在弥合这一差距，开发更通用和语言感知的视觉感知系统。

Method: 1) 使用特殊token表示0-999的量化坐标；2) 构建多数据引擎生成高质量接地、参考和指向数据；3) 采用两阶段训练：在2200万数据上进行监督微调，然后进行基于GRPO的强化学习后训练。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS基准测试中，Rex-Omni在零样本设置下达到与回归模型（如DINO、Grounding DINO）相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: Rex-Omni为更通用和语言感知的视觉感知系统铺平了道路，展示了MLLM在目标检测任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

TL;DR: DeepMMSearch-R1是首个能够按需进行多轮网络搜索、动态构建图像和文本搜索查询的多模态大语言模型，通过两阶段训练和新型数据集解决现有搜索增强方法的低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法存在流程僵化、搜索调用过多、查询构建不佳等问题，导致效率低下和结果不理想。需要开发能够动态适应真实世界变化信息的多模态搜索模型。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：冷启动监督微调阶段和在线强化学习优化。引入DeepMMSearchVQA数据集，包含通过自动化流程创建的多跳查询，集成文本和视觉信息。模型能够基于输入图像的相关裁剪启动搜索，并迭代调整文本搜索查询。

Result: 在多个知识密集型基准测试上进行广泛实验，证明了该方法的优越性。模型能够有效进行按需搜索、动态查询构建和多模态推理。

Conclusion: DeepMMSearch-R1通过创新的训练方法和数据集，显著提升了多模态网络搜索的效率和效果，为推进多模态网络搜索提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

Motivation: 评估AI代理在具有文化意义的不完全信息多人纸牌游戏Dhumbal中的表现，为文化游戏的数字保存提供技术支持。

Method: 实现多种AI策略：基于规则的启发式方法、基于搜索的方法（MCTS、ISMCTS）和强化学习方法（DQN、PPO），通过锦标赛形式进行系统比较。

Result: 在1024轮模拟中，基于规则的激进代理获得最高胜率（88.3%），显著优于ISMCTS（9.0%）和PPO（1.5%），主要得益于有效利用Jhyap声明。

Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a
culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information,
through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights
into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code,
thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI库如PyTorch和TensorFlow缺乏自动推理和知识获取支持，而传统AI语言如LISP和Prolog缺乏可扩展性和学习支持，需要一种统一解决方案。

Method: 基于张量方程构建张量逻辑语言，将逻辑规则和爱因斯坦求和视为相同操作，实现神经、符号和统计AI的统一表达。

Result: 成功实现了变换器、形式推理、核机器和图模型等关键AI形式，并支持嵌入空间中的可靠推理。

Conclusion: 张量逻辑结合了神经网络的可扩展性和可学习性与符号推理的可靠性和透明性，为AI的广泛采用提供了潜在基础。

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文发现LLM作为评估器存在严重的正向偏见问题，提出了少数否决策略和基于回归的框架来缓解这一偏见，在代码反馈任务上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着新LLM模型频繁发布，开发者需要评估是否切换到新模型。虽然人类评估是黄金标准，但成本高且不可扩展。现有的LLM-as-a-judge方法存在严重正向偏见问题。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1) 少数否决策略，对缺失数据具有弹性；2) 基于回归的框架，使用少量人工标注数据直接建模验证器偏见。

Result: 在366个高中Python程序的代码反馈任务中，回归方法将最大绝对误差降至仅1.2%，比14个最先进LLM的最佳集成性能提升2倍。

Conclusion: LLM评估器存在系统性正向偏见，提出的回归框架能有效缓解这一问题，显著提高评估精度。

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体评估存在诸多挑战，影响了对智能体真实性能的理解，需要更全面和标准化的评估方法。

Method: 1. 标准化评估框架：在数百个虚拟机上进行并行评估，将评估时间从数周缩短到数小时；2. 三维分析：涵盖模型、框架和基准三个维度；3. LLM辅助日志检查：发现未报告的行为模式。

Result: 进行了21,730次智能体运行，涵盖9个模型和9个基准测试（编码、网页导航、科学和客户服务），总成本约4万美元。发现反直觉现象：更高推理努力在多数情况下会降低准确性。通过日志检查发现了智能体在任务解决中的异常行为。

Conclusion: 通过标准化智能体评估方法并解决常见评估陷阱，希望推动研究重点从基准测试优秀表现转向真实世界可靠性的智能体开发。

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates

*Owen Queen,Harrison G. Zhang,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CGBench是一个用于评估语言模型在科学文献解释能力的新基准，基于临床遗传学专家标注数据构建，测试模型在证据提取、强度判断和结果分类方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因和变异解释方法耗时费力，需要自动化工具加速临床转化。现有基准任务过于狭窄，无法反映真实研究需求。

Method: 基于ClinGen专家标注的临床遗传学文献构建CGBench基准，测试8种不同语言模型在证据提取、强度判断和结果分类三个维度的表现。

Result: 模型在文献解释方面表现出潜力但仍存在显著差距，推理模型在细粒度任务中表现更好，非推理模型在高层次解释中更优。模型常产生幻觉或误解结果。

Conclusion: CGBench揭示了语言模型在科学文献精确解释中的优势和局限，为AI在临床遗传学和科学领域的未来研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种训练LLMs生成顺序澄清问题的方法，通过前向过程添加“噪声”到用户画像，反向过程训练模型“去噪”并学习提问技巧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在用户历史有限的情况下，通过澄清问题获取用户偏好对个性化推荐至关重要，但生成有效的跨领域顺序澄清问题仍具挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：前向过程从用户画像生成澄清问题并逐步移除答案（添加噪声），反向过程训练模型通过提问来“去噪”用户画像。

Result: 该方法显著提高了LLMs在提出漏斗式问题和有效获取用户偏好方面的能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效训练LLMs生成顺序澄清问题，从而更好地揭示用户偏好。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalTrace是一个集成在工业CoPilot中的神经符号因果分析模块，通过数据驱动的因果分析结合工业本体和知识图谱，提供因果发现、反事实推理和根本原因分析等功能，实现透明可解释的决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造环境不仅需要准确预测，还需要对过程异常、根本原因和潜在干预提供可解释的见解。现有AI系统往往作为孤立的黑盒运行，缺乏预测、解释和因果推理的无缝集成，限制了在高风险工业环境中的可信度和实用性。

Method: CausalTrace是一个神经符号因果分析模块，集成在SmartPilot工业CoPilot中。它执行数据驱动的因果分析，并通过工业本体和知识图谱进行丰富，包括因果发现、反事实推理和根本原因分析等高级功能。支持实时操作员交互，旨在通过提供透明可解释的决策支持来补充现有代理。

Result: 在学术火箭组装测试平台上，CausalTrace与领域专家达成实质性一致（本体问答ROUGE-1：0.91），并表现出强大的根本原因分析性能（MAP@3：94%，PR@2：97%，MRR：0.92，Jaccard：0.92）。在C3AN评估中获得4.59/5分，展示了实时部署的精确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: CausalTrace成功地将神经符号因果分析集成到工业CoPilot中，提供了透明、可解释的决策支持，在高风险工业环境中表现出卓越的性能和可靠性，为实际部署做好了准备。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in
the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live
deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PACT是一个评估LLM生成代码契约遵循性的框架，通过扩展HumanEval+和MBPP+基准，提供系统化的契约违反测试套件和评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准主要关注功能正确性，忽略了真实软件中契约遵循的关键要求，无法评估模型生成代码的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Method: 构建专注于契约违反的测试套件，扩展现有基准；系统分析不同提示条件下的代码生成；引入契约遵循量化指标。

Result: 研究表明，在提示中加入契约违反测试用例能显著提升模型对契约的遵循能力，优于仅使用契约描述。

Conclusion: PACT通过揭示传统基准忽略的关键错误，为评估LLM生成代码的功能性和契约遵循性提供了严格可解释的指标。

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种地理空间感知层(GAL)，通过整合基础设施、人口、地形和天气等地理数据，增强LLM在灾害响应中的地理感知能力，从而提高资源分配建议的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统计方法缺乏语义上下文，跨事件泛化能力差，可解释性有限；而LLM虽然具有少样本泛化能力，但受限于文本且缺乏地理感知。

Method: 开发地理空间感知层(GAL)，从原始野火检测数据自动检索和整合基础设施、人口、地形、天气等地理数据库信息，生成带单位标注的感知脚本，为LLM代理提供丰富上下文。

Result: 在真实野火场景中评估，地理空间接地的代理能够超越基线方法，产生基于证据的资源分配建议。

Conclusion: 该框架能够泛化到洪水、飓风等其他灾害类型，为灾害响应提供了更准确和可解释的决策支持。

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkPilot是一个无需训练即可自动优化大型推理模型推理过程的框架，通过进化过程生成think-prefixes指令来引导模型实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然强大，但仍存在推理效率低下和偏离目标的问题。现有的免训练方法要么局限于僵化的启发式规则，要么只能提供描述性但不可操作的分析。

Method: 使用进化过程生成think-prefixes，这些指令在推理行为分类学的驱动下进化，引导模型实现更优性能。

Result: ThinkPilot显著改善了准确率-长度权衡，大幅提升安全性（如将DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B的StrongREJECT分数从27.0%降至0.7），并增强了指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: think-prefixes能够可靠地控制大型推理模型的推理行为，不同任务对特定行为分布有强烈偏好。ThinkPilot通过自动识别和激发这些行为，为将模型推理与任务需求对齐提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

TL;DR: 该论文重新诠释了AI智能体中的学习角色，将其视为具有计算能力的随机动力系统，强调时间在学习推理中的基础作用，并提出从归纳学习转向转导学习，关注算法结构而非数据分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI推理智能体是否具有通用性，能否解决任何可计算任务，以及学习推理的关键因素是什么——是模型大小还是训练数据规模。

Method: 将AI智能体重新定义为计算能力的随机动力系统，提出转导学习方法，关注从过去数据中捕捉算法结构以减少解决新任务所需时间。

Result: 理论推导出推理时间与训练时间之间的幂律缩放关系，并证明无限扩展模型大小可能导致智能体成为仅能暴力破解任务的"专家"而非真正智能。

Conclusion: 在扩展推理模型时，应优化的关键量是时间而非模型大小，时间在学习中的关键作用此前仅被间接考虑。

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

TL;DR: HiCoTraj是一个基于大语言模型的零样本人口统计推理框架，通过分层思维链提示从轨迹数据推断年龄、性别、收入等人口属性，无需标注训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于移动轨迹的人口统计推断方法依赖大规模标注数据，导致可解释性差且跨数据集泛化能力弱。HiCoTraj旨在解决标注数据稀缺问题，同时提供透明的推理过程。

Method: 将轨迹转换为语义丰富的自然语言表示（详细活动记录和多尺度访问摘要），然后使用分层思维链推理，分三个阶段：事实特征提取、行为模式分析和结构化输出的人口统计推断。

Result: 在真实世界轨迹数据上的实验表明，HiCoTraj在零样本场景下对多个人口统计属性实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: HiCoTraj框架利用LLM的零样本学习和语义理解能力，有效解决了人口统计推断中的标注数据稀缺问题，同时提供了可解释的推理过程。

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

Motivation: LLM虽然具有通用决策能力，但仅基于语言训练缺乏物理环境暴露，限制了其真正的具身理解。需要桥接这一差距。

Method: 构建EmboMatrix训练场，包含多智能体数据引擎生成大规模任务场景、分布式异构硬件系统实现可扩展模拟、多级奖励架构提供精确监督。

Result: 基于EmboMatrix训练的EmboBrain-7B模型在两个具身决策基准上超越671B的DeepSeek-R1基线9.5%。

Conclusion: 交互式、环境基础的学习对于构建真正智能的具身代理具有强大能力。

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测主要关注轨迹级分析，但在包含大量人口的数据集中检测个体级异常（即个人相对于自身历史模式的异常移动行为偏差）仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: BeSTAD学习语义丰富的移动表示，整合位置含义和时间模式，采用行为聚类感知建模机制构建个性化行为档案，并通过跨时期行为比较识别异常。

Result: 该方法能够检测行为转变和既定常规的偏差，并在大规模移动数据集中识别出表现出此类变化的个体。

Conclusion: 通过直接从无标签数据中学习个体行为，BeSTAD将异常检测推向个性化和可解释的移动分析。

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM技术的快速发展，许多应用需要处理随机性，但LLM在生成和使用随机数方面的能力尚不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，考虑外部工具访问、任务类型、模型状态和提示策略等因素，涵盖随机数生成、密码生成、项目洗牌等任务，并使用熵和NIST随机性测试套件评估随机性质量。

Result: LLM在随机性任务中的表现不一致，经常显著偏离预期行为，生成的随机性输出质量有限。

Conclusion: LLM在处理涉及随机性的任务时存在关键局限性，需要在多个方面进行改进才能有效处理这类任务。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

Conclusion: 为自主构建未知复杂环境的程序化世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent
condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials
discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and
extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.

*Rongzhi Zhang,Liqin Ye,Yuzhao Heng,Xiang Chen,Tong Yu,Lingkai Kong,Sudheer Chava,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种精确控制LLM输出属性强度的方法，通过目标达成问题重新定义、训练轻量级价值函数和基于梯度的隐藏表示干预，实现细粒度连续控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法只能提供方向性或开放式指导，无法可靠实现精确的属性强度控制，这限制了AI系统适应不同用户期望的能力。

Method: 1) 将精确属性强度控制重新定义为目标达成问题；2) 通过时序差分学习训练轻量级价值函数预测属性强度；3) 使用基于梯度的隐藏表示干预精确导航模型。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.2-3b和Phi-4-mini上的实验证实该方法能够以高精度将文本生成引导至用户指定的属性强度。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了超越简单方向对齐的细粒度连续控制，并在偏好数据合成、帕累托前沿近似和优化、对齐行为蒸馏等下游任务中展示了效率提升。

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

TL;DR: MatSciBench是一个包含1340个大学水平材料科学问题的综合基准，涵盖6个主要领域和31个子领域，具有三级难度分类和多模态推理能力。评估显示即使最佳模型准确率也不到80%，不同推理策略在不同场景下表现各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学推理方面表现出色，但在材料科学领域的推理能力尚未充分探索，需要建立专门的基准来评估和推动该领域的发展。

Method: 创建MatSciBench基准，包含1340个结构化分类的问题，采用三级难度分类，包含多模态推理元素，并评估了链式思维、工具增强和自我纠正等不同推理策略。

Result: 最佳模型Gemini-2.5-Pro在材料科学问题上的准确率低于80%，不同推理策略在不同场景下表现不一致，多模态推理任务存在挑战。

Conclusion: MatSciBench为评估和提升LLMs在材料科学领域的科学推理能力提供了全面可靠的基准，揭示了当前模型在该领域的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language
Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA
models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

We present ResearStudio, the first open-source framework that places real-time
human control at its core. The system follows a Collaborative Workshop design.
A hierarchical Planner-Executor writes every step to a live

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对65个评估可解释AI系统的用户研究进行了全面回顾，提出了以人为中心的XAI系统评估框架和设计目标，针对不同AI专业水平的用户（AI新手和数据专家）提供了定制化的设计指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，对既高性能又可理解的智能系统需求日益增长。当前XAI系统的评估过于技术化，缺乏对用户需求的关注，需要建立以人为中心的评估框架。

Method: 通过全面回顾65个XAI用户研究，分析XAI系统特性和评估指标，提出以人为中心的设计目标，并根据用户AI专业水平（AI新手和数据专家）进行目标适配。

Result: 区分了核心系统与XAI解释组件，将评估指标分为系统情感、认知、可用性、可解释性和解释指标，用户特征和行为也可评估。为AI新手提供负责任使用、接受度和可用性目标，为数据专家提供性能导向目标。

Conclusion: 提出了扩展的XAI评估和设计框架，强调根据用户专业水平定制设计目标，为XAI开发者提供了以人为中心的系统设计和评估指导。

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

TL;DR: GOAT是一个无需人工标注的训练框架，能够从API文档自动构建合成数据集，用于微调LLM代理处理目标导向的API执行任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在处理需要分解高级目标为多个相互依赖API调用的目标导向查询时能力有限，而开源模型在复杂工具使用方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出GOAT框架，从API文档自动构建合成数据集，训练LLM代理推理相互依赖的API调用并生成连贯响应。

Result: GOAT训练的代理在多个现有目标导向基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在新提出的GOATBench基准上也表现出色。

Conclusion: GOAT为构建能够进行复杂推理和工具使用的强大开源LLM代理提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedKGEval是一个基于结构化医学知识的多轮评估框架，用于评估临床大语言模型，通过知识图谱驱动的患者模拟和实时评估机制，能够发现传统评估方法忽略的细微行为缺陷和安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型医学评估方法主要依赖对话记录的事后审查，忽略了医疗对话的动态性和上下文敏感性，无法捕捉真实临床环境中复杂的医患多轮互动。

Method: 构建了基于知识图谱的患者模拟机制，通过控制模块从知识图谱中检索相关医学事实；开发了实时轮级评估框架，由评估代理使用细粒度指标评估每个模型响应的临床适当性、事实正确性和安全性；建立了多轮基准测试。

Result: 对八个最先进的大语言模型进行了全面评估，证明了MedKGEval能够识别传统评估管道经常忽略的细微行为缺陷和安全风险。

Conclusion: MedKGEval提供了一个有效的多轮评估框架，能够更准确地评估临床大语言模型，支持中英文应用并可扩展到其他语言。

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了PromptFlow框架，通过模块化设计和元学习自动优化提示工程，减少人工干预并提高LLM在特定领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在专业领域部署时，手动提示设计耗时且依赖专家经验的问题，以及现有自动提示工程方法缺乏动态策略选择和细粒度编辑能力。

Method: 提出PromptFlow模块化训练框架，包含元提示、操作符、优化器和评估器，采用基于梯度的元学习和强化学习来回收经验，自动探索最优提示优化路径。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了PromptFlow的有效性，能够以最少任务特定训练数据实现高性能。

Conclusion: PromptFlow为自动提示工程提供了灵活高效的解决方案，通过模块化设计和经验回收机制显著提升了LLM在专业任务中的适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了T³方法，通过检测信念偏差并截断训练轨迹来改善LLM主动推理中的信念跟踪问题，显著提升了训练稳定性、效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在主动推理中经常出现信念偏差问题，导致无法正确建模信念、丢失问题状态跟踪，陷入无信息或重复动作。一旦发生这种情况，错误会累积，强化学习训练无法正确归因关键探索步骤。

Method: 开发T³方法，跟踪模型信念偏差，检测过度的信念偏差并在训练期间截断轨迹以移除无信息尾部，从而保留信息前缀的信用。

Result: 在5个挑战性任务中，T³持续提升了训练稳定性、token效率和最终性能，实现了高达30%的性能增益，同时减少了约25%的rollout token。

Conclusion: 信念控制是开发鲁棒且可泛化的基于LLM的主动推理器的关键原则。

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

TL;DR: RAG-Anything是一个统一的多模态检索增强生成框架，能够处理文本、图像、表格和数学表达式等多种模态内容，解决了传统RAG仅限于文本的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界知识库本质上是多模态的，包含文本、视觉元素、结构化表格和数学表达式，但现有RAG框架仅限于文本内容，在处理多模态文档时存在根本性差距。

Method: 将多模态内容重新概念化为相互连接的知识实体，引入双图构建来捕捉跨模态关系和文本语义，开发跨模态混合检索结合结构知识导航和语义匹配。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多模态基准测试中表现出卓越性能，相比最先进方法有显著改进，在长文档处理上优势尤为明显。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态知识访问建立了新范式，消除了当前系统的架构碎片化约束。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在数学研究中验证困难的问题，证明虽然看起来合理但缺乏严格验证。Terry Tao等数学家认为AI工具在寻找合适的域分解方面对研究级渐近分析很有帮助。

Method: 使用LLM+CAS框架，通过符号反馈循环：LLM建议域分解，CAS（如Mathematica）对每个部分进行公理化验证，形成迭代改进过程。

Result: 该框架在提出合适的域分解方面表现出显著效果，能够回答Terry Tao提出的关于LLM与验证器结合能否证明复杂渐近不等式的问题。

Conclusion: LLM+CAS框架展示了AI可以超越竞赛数学，成为专业数学家的研究级工具，为数学研究提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次对基于大型语言模型的Vibe Coding范式进行了系统综述，通过分析1000多篇研究论文，建立了该领域的理论基础和实践框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的发展，编程范式从代码生成辅助转向自主编程代理，催生了"Vibe Coding"这种通过观察结果而非逐行代码理解来验证AI生成实现的新开发方法。但其有效性尚未得到充分探索，实证研究显示存在生产力损失和人类-AI协作挑战。

Method: 通过系统分析1000多篇研究论文，建立Vibe Coding的理论基础，将其形式化为约束马尔可夫决策过程，并综合现有实践归纳出五种开发模型。

Result: 提出了Vibe Coding作为正式学科的理论框架，识别了五种不同的开发模型，并发现成功Vibe Coding依赖于系统上下文工程、完善的开发环境和人机协作模型。

Conclusion: Vibe Coding的成功不仅取决于代理能力，更需要系统化的上下文工程、完善的开发环境以及有效的人类-代理协作开发模型。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

TL;DR: PricingLogic是首个评估大语言模型在旅游定价任务中可靠性的基准，包含300个基于真实定价政策的自然语言问题，测试结果显示LLMs在复杂定价场景中存在系统性失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游机构希望将容易出错的定价任务自动化给AI系统，但未经验证可靠性的LLMs部署可能导致重大财务损失和客户信任危机。

Method: 构建包含300个自然语言问题的基准数据集，基于42个真实定价政策，涵盖两个难度级别：基础客户类型定价和涉及交互折扣的捆绑旅游计算。

Result: 对一系列LLMs的评估显示，在更难的层级上性能急剧下降，暴露出规则解释和算术推理方面的系统性失败。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs具备通用能力，但在没有进一步保障措施或领域适应的情况下，当今的LLMs在收入关键应用中仍然不可靠。

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.

*Dingyi Zuo,Hongjie Zhang,Jie Ou,Chaosheng Feng,Shuwan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MTOS框架，将多主题环境与LLM结合，通过记忆机制、交互策略和信念衰减来模拟跨主题的观点演化，解决了现有单主题LLM研究和传统数值模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中的观点极化、信息隔离和认知偏见问题日益严重，现实网络中的信息往往涉及多个相关主题，需要能够模拟多主题交互的框架。现有LLM研究主要关注单主题，传统数值模型则简化了复杂的语言态度。

Method: MTOS框架整合LLM与短期/长期记忆，采用多种用户选择交互机制和动态主题选择策略，使用信念衰减机制实现跨主题观点更新。

Result: 多主题设置显著改变极化趋势：正相关主题放大回音室效应，负相关主题抑制回音室，无关主题通过资源竞争也能减轻回音室效应。相比数值模型，LLM智能体能更真实地模拟动态观点变化。

Conclusion: MTOS框架通过多主题设置和LLM集成，提高了社会模拟的逼真度和可解释性，能够捕捉复杂的人类推理过程，改善系统稳定性。

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的无信号交叉口决策框架，结合偏向注意力机制构建交通风险预测器，通过SAC算法实现主动安全控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无信号交叉口自动驾驶决策面临复杂动态交互和高冲突风险，需要实现主动安全控制。

Method: 基于Soft Actor-Critic算法，使用偏向注意力机制构建交通风险预测器，将碰撞风险转化为密集奖励信号指导决策。

Result: 仿真结果表明该方法有效提高了交叉口的交通效率和车辆安全性。

Conclusion: 该智能决策框架在复杂场景中具有有效性，证明了主动安全控制的可行性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is
available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了LLM作为评判员时的判断偏见问题，涵盖了11种偏见类型，发现现有LLM评判员对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，但微调会显著降低性能，并提出了四种缓解策略。


<details>

Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地用于自主评估通信系统内容质量，需要确保这些AI"评判员"的公正性，避免偏见影响评估结果和用户信任。

Method: 系统研究两种LLM评判模型在点式评分设置下的判断偏见，涵盖11种偏见类型，包括隐性和显性形式，分析偏见输入、评分标准、微调效果和任务难度的影响。

Result: 发现最先进的LLM评判员对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，通常给偏见样本较低分数；提供详细评分标准能增强鲁棒性；在偏见数据上微调会显著降低性能；评判分数与任务难度相关。

Conclusion: 提出了四种缓解策略，以确保在实际通信场景中实现公平可靠的AI评判。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

Motivation: 为医疗对话系统设计一个结构化的框架，能够有效整合临床指南，减少医生认知负担，并支持高效报告生成。

Method: 采用有向无环图结构，集成系统化管道将医疗算法转化为临床问题库，包含冷启动机制、扩展剪枝机制、终止逻辑和自动化报告合成。

Result: 患者应用获得低认知负荷(15.6)、高可用性(86)和强满意度(8.1/9)；医生应用获得中等认知负荷(26)、优秀可用性(88.5)和高满意度(8.3/9)。

Conclusion: 该框架成功集成到临床工作流中，降低了认知需求并支持高效报告生成，但存在系统延迟和小样本评估的局限性。

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

TL;DR: 提出了细胞状态潜在（CSL）视角，通过操作符语法组织学习，强调跨模态、尺度、情境和干预的决策对齐评估，以解决当前AI虚拟细胞模型在跨实验室迁移、数据泄露和剂量时间效应处理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI虚拟细胞模型虽然在单数据集验证中表现良好，但在跨实验室和平台迁移时效果有限，存在数据泄露和覆盖偏差问题，且剂量、时间和组合效应尚未系统处理。跨尺度耦合受限，分子、细胞和组织水平的锚点稀疏，与科学或临床读数的对齐不一致。

Method: 提出模型无关的细胞状态潜在（CSL）视角，通过操作符语法组织学习：测量、提升/投影用于跨尺度耦合，干预用于剂量和调度。强调操作符感知的数据设计、抗泄露分区以及透明校准和报告。

Result: 该方法促成了跨模态、尺度、情境和干预的决策对齐评估蓝图，强调功能空间读数如通路活性、空间邻域和临床相关终点。

Conclusion: CSL视角和操作符语法有助于实现可重复、同类比较的AI虚拟细胞模型，通过改进数据设计和评估方法提升模型的泛化能力和临床相关性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

TL;DR: ProtoSiTex是一个半可解释框架，用于细粒度多标签文本分类，通过双阶段交替训练策略学习语义连贯且多样化的原型，并在多个基准数据集上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户生成评论的激增需要可解释模型提供细粒度洞察。现有基于原型的模型通常只在粗粒度（句子或文档级别）操作，无法处理现实世界文本分类的多标签特性。

Method: 采用双阶段交替训练策略：无监督原型发现阶段学习语义连贯且多样化的原型，监督分类阶段将这些原型映射到类别标签。使用分层损失函数在子句、句子和文档级别强制一致性，通过自适应原型和多头注意力捕获重叠和冲突语义。

Result: 在酒店评论基准数据集和两个公共基准（二分类和多分类）上的实验表明，ProtoSiTex实现了最先进的性能，同时提供忠实、与人类对齐的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex是半可解释多标签文本分类的稳健解决方案，能够提供细粒度的可解释性，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

Motivation: 受自然选择中竞争与合作力量驱动智力进化的启发，旨在创建能产生更复杂社会动态和战略智能的多智能体系统。

Method: 采用基于基因型的多智能体强化学习框架，智能体共享遗传物质，奖励函数基于包容性适应度概念设计，在囚徒困境网络游戏中验证。

Result: 实验结果与生物学原理（如汉密尔顿法则）一致，展示了基于遗传相似性的合作谱系和独特的社会动态。

Conclusion: 基于包容性适应度的奖励机制为更高级战略智能和社会智能的出现提供了基础，可扩展到具有时空结构和有限资源的开放环境。

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注9x9数独等流行谜题，容易导致模型过拟合标准格式和记忆解法模式，掩盖了模型在理解新规则或适应新变体方面的缺陷。

Method: 通过三个维度系统性地转换标准谜题：增加复杂性(IC)、不常见元素(UE)和不可解谜题(UP)，减少对捷径记忆的依赖。

Result: 评估显示即使在其他基准上表现优异的模型也出现显著性能下降，表明模型严重依赖记忆的刻板模式。增加复杂性是主要困难来源，但模型在细微规则变化上也表现不佳。

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic揭示了当前大型推理模型的局限性，并为推进高级逻辑推理建立了基准。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

Conclusion: 将内存管理重构为可学习的内在能力，通过端到端强化学习联合优化，能够有效提升长视野任务中的性能表现和计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

Conclusion: ERA为可扩展的具身智能提供了实用路径，为未来具身AI系统提供了方法论见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论框架能有效提升LLM自动判断任务的性能，通过协作推理和智能停止机制实现准确性与效率的平衡。

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: 方法显示出有希望的结果，证明CAM数据确实可以支持车辆轨迹预测，但也发现了一些局限性。

Conclusion: CAM数据在车辆轨迹预测方面具有潜力，但需要进一步研究来解决现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =
0.99.

Conclusion: CLUTCH在JavaScript模糊测试中显著提高了效率，证明了深度组合多臂老虎机在突变目标选择问题上的有效性。

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

TL;DR: CTRL-Rec是一种通过自然语言控制推荐系统的方法，使用LLM模拟用户对推荐项目的判断，训练嵌入模型来近似这些判断，并将基于用户请求的预测集成到传统推荐系统的信号加权中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户对推荐系统不满意时，他们通常缺乏细粒度的控制来改变推荐结果。大语言模型(LLMs)通过允许用户使用自然语言请求来指导推荐，提供了一个解决方案。

Method: 在训练时，使用LLM模拟用户是否会根据语言请求批准项目，并训练嵌入模型来近似这些模拟判断。然后将基于用户请求的预测集成到传统推荐系统优化的标准信号加权中。在部署时，每个用户请求只需要一次LLM嵌入计算，实现实时推荐控制。

Result: 在MovieLens数据集上的实验表明，该方法在各种请求上都能实现细粒度控制。在19名Letterboxd用户的研究中，CTRL-Rec受到用户积极评价，与传统控制相比显著增强了用户的控制感和推荐满意度。

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec方法能够通过自然语言实现对传统推荐系统的实时控制，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升用户体验。

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

TL;DR: Ax-Prover是一个基于多智能体系统的自动定理证明器，使用Lean语言，能够跨领域解决科学问题，支持自主和协作两种工作模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学问题需要结合创造性推理和严格的形式化验证，传统专用证明器难以泛化到不同领域。

Method: 通过模型上下文协议（MCP）为大型语言模型配备Lean工具，结合LLM的知识推理能力和形式化验证工具的正确性保证。

Result: 在公开数学基准测试中与最先进证明器竞争，在新引入的抽象代数和量子理论基准测试中表现更优，并成功辅助数学家形式化复杂密码学定理证明。

Conclusion: 基于工具的智能体定理证明方法为跨领域形式化验证提供了可泛化的通用方法学。

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.
