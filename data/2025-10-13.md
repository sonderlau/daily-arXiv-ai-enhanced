### [1] [Project Severe Weather Archive of the Philippines (SWAP) Part 2: Baseline Climatology of Close Proximity Soundings in Hailstorm Environments across Luzon, Philippines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09530)
*Generich H. Capuli*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 分析了菲律宾吕宋岛171个冰雹雷暴环境的探空数据，发现该地区冰雹形成模式与其他地区不同：需要高CAPE条件但弱深层风切变，用云底到平衡层风切变替代传统0-6km风切变能更好预测冰雹概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究菲律宾吕宋岛冰雹雷暴环境的独特特征，因为现有全球严重天气气候学可能不适用于该地区，需要建立适合当地条件的预测参数。

Method: 使用2005-2024年171个近距离探空数据，计算不稳定度、垂直风结构和湿度参数，分析它们与冰雹形成的关系，并进行风矢端曲线分析。

Result: 吕宋岛冰雹环境具有高CAPE、充足边界层水分、陡峭中低层温度直减率和高抬升凝结高度特征，但深层风切变普遍较弱。云底到平衡层风切变能更好预测冰雹概率。

Conclusion: W_MAXSHEAR、W_MAXSHEAR_LCL-EL和BWD_LCL-EL等参数可作为区分普通和产生冰雹的严重雷暴的有效指标，识别出两种主要冰雹天气型：东风型（信风）和西风型（亚洲夏季风）。

Abstract: The environments of severe thunderstorms that produced hail were examined
using 171 proximity soundings (2005-2024) archived in the 3rd Data Release of
Project SWAP. These soundings were categorized based on their geographical
occurrence into three hail-prone environments across Luzon, Philippines. For
each case, key parameters describing instability, vertical wind structure, and
moisture were calculated to assess their relationship to hail formation. The
probability of hail occurrence, expressed as a function of W$_{\text{MAX}}$
($\sqrt{2 \times \text{CAPE}}$) and 0-6 km bulk shear (DLS), revealed patterns
distinct from those reported in other regions. Hail events in Luzon were most
likely under high CAPE conditions, where boundary-layer moisture was
sufficient, mid- and low-level lapse rates were steep, and lifting condensation
levels were high. Surprisingly, weak DLS was common across Luzon hail
environments, diverging from existing severe weather climatologies, yet large
DCAPE indicated environments conducive to damaging wind events. When DLS was
replaced with the shear magnitude between the cloud base and equilibrium level,
the probability of hail occurrence increased, better aligning with global
severe weather climatologies. This finding is supported by hodograph analyses,
which show largely unidirectional wind profiles: strong speed shear aloft but
weak directional shear in the low-levels. Parameters such as
W$_{\text{MAX}}$SHEAR, W$_{\text{MAX}}$SHEAR$_{\text{LCL-EL}}$, and
BWD$_{\text{LCL-EL}}$ emerge as potential discriminators between non-severe and
severe thunderstorms capable of producing hail, and as useful metrics for
assessing convective storm severity in Luzon and possibly countrywide. Finally,
two recurring severe setups conducive to hail were identified: (1) an easterly
regime associated with trade winds, and (2) a westerly regime linked to the
Asian summer monsoon.

### [2] [A Neural Surrogate-Enhanced Multi-Method Framework for Robust Wing Design Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08582)
*Arash Fath Lipaei,AmirHossein Ghaemi,Melika Sabzikari*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一个模块化、可扩展的机翼设计优化框架，通过多种优化算法和代理神经网络模型实现快速早期设计，同时确保气动稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在早期设计阶段实现更快的机翼设计过程，同时保证气动稳定性，需要开发一个高效的优化框架。

Method: 使用涡格法(VLM)评估气动性能，建立代理神经网络模型预测升力和阻力，集成多种优化算法(PSO、GA、梯度法、贝叶斯优化等)进行优化，通过固定控制面位置评估稳定性。

Result: 结果显示气动特性得到改善，具有稳健的稳定性特性，为机翼设计提供了高速和精确的机制。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了快速精确的机翼设计优化，完整实现已公开供社区使用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a modular and scalable design optimization framework
for the wing design process that enables faster early-phase design while
ensuring aerodynamic stability. The pipeline starts with the generation of
initial wing geometries and then proceeds to optimize the wing using several
algorithms. Aerodynamic performance is assessed using a Vortex Lattice Method
(VLM) applied to a carefully selected dataset of wing configurations. These
results are employed to develop surrogate neural network models, which can
predict lift and drag rapidly and accurately. The stability evaluation is
implemented by setting the control surfaces and components to fixed positions
in order to have realistic flight dynamics. The approach unifies and compares
several optimization techniques, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),
Genetic Algorithms (GA), gradient-based MultiStart methods, Bayesian
optimization, and Lipschitz optimization. Each method ensures constraint
management via adaptive strategies and penalty functions, where the targets for
lift and design feasibility are enforced. The progression of aerodynamic
characteristics and geometries over the optimization iterations will be
investigated in order to clarify each algorithm's convergence characteristics
and performance efficiency. Our results show improvement in aerodynamic
qualities and robust stability properties, offering a mechanism for wing design
at speed and precision. In the interest of reproducibility and community
development, the complete implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/AmirHosseinGhaemi2000/CHIMERA.

### [3] [Evolutionary Computation as Natural Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08590)
*Yaxin Shi,Abhishek Gupta,Ying Wu,Melvin Wong,Ivor Tsang,Thiago Rios,Stefan Menzel,Bernhard Sendhoff,Yaqing Hou,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文将进化计算重新定义为自然生成AI，提出进化计算通过探索性搜索和自然选择可以克服传统生成AI的局限性，实现更具创造性和多样性的生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成AI受限于有限训练数据的统计模型和局部梯度信号，容易产生衍生性而非真正创造性的结果。进化计算提供了超越数据限制的搜索驱动路径，能够探索未知解空间。

Method: 将进化计算重新定义为自然生成AI，分析经典进化计算与常规生成AI的对应关系，引入破坏性操作符实现结构化进化跳跃，利用进化多任务方法整合跨域重组和适度选择机制。

Result: 破坏性操作符能够在少数几代内生成分布外的人工产物，进化多任务方法能够促进持续创新，实现跨域特征的整合。

Conclusion: 通过将进化计算重新定义为自然生成AI，强调结构化破坏和选择压力调节是创造力的关键驱动力，扩展了生成范式的边界，使进化计算在生成AI时代对探索性设计、创新和科学发现至关重要。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has achieved remarkable success across a range of
domains, but its capabilities remain constrained to statistical models of
finite training sets and learning based on local gradient signals. This often
results in artifacts that are more derivative than genuinely generative. In
contrast, Evolutionary Computation (EC) offers a search-driven pathway to
greater diversity and creativity, expanding generative capabilities by
exploring uncharted solution spaces beyond the limits of available data. This
work establishes a fundamental connection between EC and GenAI, redefining EC
as Natural Generative AI (NatGenAI) -- a generative paradigm governed by
exploratory search under natural selection. We demonstrate that classical EC
with parent-centric operators mirrors conventional GenAI, while disruptive
operators enable structured evolutionary leaps, often within just a few
generations, to generate out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, the methods
of evolutionary multitasking provide an unparalleled means of integrating
disruptive EC (with cross-domain recombination of evolved features) and
moderated selection mechanisms (allowing novel solutions to survive), thereby
fostering sustained innovation. By reframing EC as NatGenAI, we emphasize
structured disruption and selection pressure moderation as essential drivers of
creativity. This perspective extends the generative paradigm beyond
conventional boundaries and positions EC as crucial to advancing exploratory
design, innovation, scientific discovery, and open-ended generation in the
GenAI era.

### [4] [The Enduring Dominance of Deep Neural Networks: A Critical Analysis of the Fundamental Limitations of Quantum Machine Learning and Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08591)
*Takehiro Ishikawa*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 量子机器学习和脉冲神经网络不太可能在短期内取代深度神经网络，DNNs凭借高效的反向传播、强大的正则化和推理时计算扩展等优势，仍然是AI发展的主导范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨量子机器学习和脉冲神经网络是否能够替代深度神经网络成为AI发展的主流范式，分析它们面临的技术挑战和局限性。

Method: 通过分析QML面临的幺正约束、状态坍缩、贫瘠高原、测量开销等量子硬件限制，以及SNN在表示带宽、长程依赖处理、语义编码等方面的局限性，对比DNNs在训练效率、正则化技术、推理时计算扩展等方面的优势。

Result: QML和SNN面临严重的技术障碍，而DNNs通过反向传播、正则化创新和推理时计算扩展等机制，在性能和效率上持续领先，如Grok-4 Heavy和gpt-oss-120b等模型证明了DNNs的优越性。

Conclusion: 量子机器学习和脉冲神经网络可能在某些特定混合应用中发挥作用，但深度神经网络仍然是AI进步的主导实用范式，具有不可替代的优势。

Abstract: Recent advancements in QML and SNNs have generated considerable excitement,
promising exponential speedups and brain-like energy efficiency to
revolutionize AI. However, this paper argues that they are unlikely to displace
DNNs in the near term. QML struggles with adapting backpropagation due to
unitary constraints, measurement-induced state collapse, barren plateaus, and
high measurement overheads, exacerbated by the limitations of current noisy
intermediate-scale quantum hardware, overfitting risks due to underdeveloped
regularization techniques, and a fundamental misalignment with machine
learning's generalization. SNNs face restricted representational bandwidth,
struggling with long-range dependencies and semantic encoding in language tasks
due to their discrete, spike-based processing. Furthermore, the goal of
faithfully emulating the brain might impose inherent inefficiencies like
cognitive biases, limited working memory, and slow learning speeds. Even their
touted energy-efficient advantages are overstated; optimized DNNs with
quantization can outperform SNNs in energy costs under realistic conditions.
Finally, SNN training incurs high computational overhead from temporal
unfolding. In contrast, DNNs leverage efficient backpropagation, robust
regularization, and innovations in LRMs that shift scaling to inference-time
compute, enabling self-improvement via RL and search algorithms like MCTS while
mitigating data scarcity. This superiority is evidenced by recent models such
as xAI's Grok-4 Heavy, which advances SOTA performance, and gpt-oss-120b, which
surpasses or approaches the performance of leading industry models despite its
modest 120-billion-parameter size deployable on a single 80GB GPU. Furthermore,
specialized ASICs amplify these efficiency gains. Ultimately, QML and SNNs may
serve niche hybrid roles, but DNNs remain the dominant, practical paradigm for
AI advancement.

### [5] [A Denoising Diffusion-Based Evolutionary Algorithm Framework: Application to the Maximum Independent Set Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08627)
*Joan Salvà Soler,Günther R. Raidl*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合去噪扩散模型和进化算法的混合框架DDEA，在组合优化问题上超越了现有扩散模型方法和传统求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去噪扩散模型在组合优化中缺乏传统元启发式算法（如进化算法）的强大探索能力，需要将两者优势结合。

Method: 使用预训练DDM进行高质量多样化种群初始化，并开发基于扩散的重组算子，通过模仿学习训练。

Result: 在最大独立集问题上，DDEA在相同时间预算下优于DIFUSCO，在更大图上超越Gurobi，解大小分别提高3.9%和7.5%。

Conclusion: DDM和EA的混合方法为复杂组合优化问题提供了有前景的机器学习求解器发展方向。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) offer a promising generative approach for
combinatorial optimization, yet they often lack the robust exploration
capabilities of traditional metaheuristics like evolutionary algorithms (EAs).
We propose a Denoising Diffusion-based Evolutionary Algorithm (DDEA) framework
that synergistically integrates these paradigms. It utilizes pre-trained DDMs
for both high-quality and diverse population initialization and a novel
diffusion-based recombination operator, trained via imitation learning against
an optimal demonstrator. Evaluating DDEA on the Maximum Independent Set problem
on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, we demonstrate notable improvements over DIFUSCO,
a leading DDM solver. DDEA consistently outperforms it given the same time
budget, and surpasses Gurobi on larger graphs under the same time limit, with
DDEA's solution sizes being 3.9% and 7.5% larger on the ER-300-400 and
ER-700-800 datasets, respectively. In out-of-distribution experiments, DDEA
provides solutions of 11.6% higher quality than DIFUSCO under the same time
limit. Ablation studies confirm that both diffusion initialization and
recombination are crucial. Our work highlights the potential of hybridizing
DDMs and EAs, offering a promising direction for the development of powerful
machine learning solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems.

### [6] [Fast and robust parametric and functional learning with Hybrid Genetic Optimisation (HyGO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09391)
*Isaac Robledo,Yiqing Li,Guy Y. Cornejo Maceda,Rodrigo Castellanos*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: HyGO是一个混合遗传优化框架，集成了进化算法的全局探索能力和加速局部搜索，支持参数和函数优化问题，在工程应用中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足对高效统一优化框架的需求，解决进化算法收敛速度慢的问题，特别是在复杂工程问题中同时支持参数和函数学习。

Method: 采用两阶段策略平衡探索和利用：对于参数问题，交替使用遗传算法和抗退化的下山单纯形法；对于函数优化，在遗传编程和DSM之间轮换。

Result: 在参数优化基准测试中比标准遗传算法收敛更快更稳健；在函数优化任务中成功控制阻尼Landau振荡器；在Ahmed车身气动减阻应用中实现超过20%的减阻效果。

Conclusion: HyGO是一个适用于广泛工程和科学问题的多功能混合优化框架，特别适合涉及参数和函数学习的复杂场景。

Abstract: The Hybrid Genetic Optimisation framework (HyGO) is introduced to meet the
pressing need for efficient and unified optimisation frameworks that support
both parametric and functional learning in complex engineering problems.
Evolutionary algorithms are widely employed as derivative-free global
optimisation methods but often suffer from slow convergence rates, especially
during late-stage learning. HyGO integrates the global exploration capabilities
of evolutionary algorithms with accelerated local search for robust solution
refinement. The key enabler is a two-stage strategy that balances exploration
and exploitation. For parametric problems, HyGO alternates between a genetic
algorithm and targeted improvement through a degradation-proof Dowhill Simplex
Method (DSM). For function optimisation tasks, HyGO rotates between genetic
programming and DSM. Validation is performed on (a) parametric optimisation
benchmarks, where HyGO demonstrates faster and more robust convergence than
standard genetic algorithms, and (b) function optimisation tasks, including
control of a damped Landau oscillator. Practical relevance is showcased through
aerodynamic drag reduction of an Ahmed body via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations, achieving consistently interpretable results and reductions
exceeding 20% by controlled jet injection in the back of the body for flow
reattachment and separation bubble reduction. Overall, HyGO emerges as a
versatile hybrid optimisation framework suitable for a broad spectrum of
engineering and scientific problems involving parametric and functional
learning.

### [7] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了传统CNN、零样本多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM在图像中人工文本叠加检测任务上的表现，发现LLM仅需少量数据微调即可显著提升性能，甚至超越需要大量数据的CNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中的潜力，特别是如何通过有限数据微调来充分发挥其能力，解决传统CNN模型需要大量数据的限制。

Method: 对传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM进行综合比较，重点研究LLM在少量数据（少于1000张图像）下的微调效果。

Result: LLM经过微调后准确率提升高达36%，能够匹配甚至超越需要大量数据的CNN基线模型，展示了出色的数据效率。

Conclusion: 多模态LLM在视觉任务中具有强大的适应性和数据效率，为低资源视觉环境下的跨模态学习提供了有效策略，证明了语言引导模型在精确视觉理解中的潜力。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

### [8] [Reproducible Evaluation of Data Augmentation and Loss Functions for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08617)
*Saumya B*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了U-Net在脑肿瘤MRI分割中的性能，使用focal loss和数据增强技术，达到了90%的精确度，并提供了可复现的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但类别不平衡和模型泛化能力有限等问题阻碍了进展。

Method: 在公开MRI数据集上使用U-Net进行分割实验，采用focal loss参数调优，并评估三种数据增强技术：水平翻转、旋转和缩放。

Result: 使用focal loss的U-Net达到了90%的精确度，与最先进结果相当。

Conclusion: 通过公开所有代码和结果，本研究建立了一个透明、可复现的基准，为未来脑肿瘤分割中的数据增强策略和损失函数设计提供指导。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [9] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出通过调整初始噪声来促进文本到图像扩散模型更早地逃离记忆化吸引盆，从而减少训练数据复制并保持图像-文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型经常记忆和复制训练数据，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有方法延迟应用分类器自由引导(CFG)来避免记忆化，但这会导致图像与输入提示对齐不佳。

Method: 提出两种缓解策略：1) 集体调整初始噪声；2) 个体调整初始噪声，寻找能促进更早逃离记忆化吸引盆的初始样本。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了记忆化，同时保持了图像-文本对齐。

Conclusion: 初始噪声样本在决定记忆化逃离时间中起关键作用，通过调整初始噪声可以有效缓解扩散模型的记忆化问题。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究测试了AI生成图像中的代表性偏见，发现DALL-E 3和Ideogram都强化了传统性别刻板印象，但程度不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注AI生成可视化内容的创作过程和质量，忽视了代表性偏见问题，特别是在职业场景中的性别刻板印象。

Method: 通过生成750多张职业相关的AI图像，使用主题分析方法评估DALL-E 3和Ideogram两个AI图像生成工具的表现。

Result: 研究发现两个AI工具都强化了传统性别刻板印象，在职业图像中表现出明显的性别偏见。

Conclusion: AI可视化工具存在强化狭隘代表性的风险，需要采取措施确保媒体和专业场景中的多样化代表性。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在视觉自回归模型(VAR)中引入动态混合专家路由器，通过尺度感知阈值实现计算量与质量的权衡，无需额外训练即可减少20% FLOPs、加速11%推理，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在生成高分辨率图像时存在计算冗余问题，因为Transformer需要在不断增加的分辨率上重复调用。

Method: 在VAR架构中集成动态混合专家路由器，采用基于令牌复杂度和分辨率的尺度感知阈值策略来平衡专家选择。

Result: 实现了20%的FLOPs减少、11%的推理加速，同时图像质量与密集基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了VAR模型的计算冗余问题，实现了计算效率与生成质量的良好平衡。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [12] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，通过分离认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，在LiDAR点云语义分割中显著提升了OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法通常依赖预测熵，但这种方法混淆了认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，容易将分布内模糊区域误分类为OOD。需要一种能够更好分离这两种不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用层次贝叶斯建模对深度神经网络特征空间中的高斯混合模型参数进行建模，从中提取认知不确定性用于OOD检测，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，相比基于预测熵的方法，AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95从76%降低到40%（减少36%）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过层次贝叶斯建模有效分离认知不确定性，在无监督OOD检测中显著优于现有不确定性方法，且无需额外数据或训练。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Hi-OSCAR：一种层次化开放集活动识别分类器，能够在保持最先进准确率的同时拒绝未知活动，并提供超越二元分类的层次化定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类活动识别中存在训练数据集活动范围与真实生活活动之间的巨大差距，且活动类别之间存在层次化关系，需要处理未知活动和类别相似性问题。

Method: 将活动类别组织成结构化层次，开发Hi-OSCAR层次化开放集分类器，能够识别已知活动并拒绝未知活动，同时将未知类别定位到最近的内部节点。

Result: 开发了新的数据集NFI_FARED，包含19种不同情境下的活动数据，完全公开可下载。提出的方法能够实现开放集分类并提供层次化洞察。

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR方法有效解决了HAR中的开放集问题，不仅提高了分类器的可靠性，还提供了超越简单二元分类的层次化定位能力。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频振荡是识别癫痫发作区的新生物标志物，但视觉识别耗时费力且主观，需要开发自动化检测方法用于研究和临床应用。

Method: 使用时频域S变换提取事件，采用无监督聚类技术将高频振荡事件与尖峰、背景活动和伪迹区分开来。

Result: 在受控数据集上达到97.67%灵敏度、98.57%精确度和97.78% F分数；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点的高频振荡率比值为0.73，与手术结果相关性更强。

Conclusion: 高频振荡是癫痫患者癫痫发生性的有前景生物标志物，切除高频振荡（特别是快速波纹）可导致无癫痫发作，而残留高频振荡则导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

*Thomas Fel,Binxu Wang,Michael A. Lepori,Matthew Kowal,Andrew Lee,Randall Balestriero,Sonia Joseph,Ekdeep S. Lubana,Talia Konkle,Demba Ba,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究分析了DINOv2视觉Transformer的内部表示机制，通过稀疏自编码器构建了32,000个概念词典，揭示了模型表示的部分密集性、几何结构和基于原型混合的表示机制，提出了Minkowski表示假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DINOv2被广泛用于物体、场景和动作识别，但其内部感知机制仍不明确。研究旨在理解视觉Transformer如何表示视觉概念及其几何组织方式。

Method: 采用线性表示假说作为基线，使用稀疏自编码器学习32,000个概念词典，分析不同下游任务如何利用这些概念，并研究表示的几何和统计特性。

Result: 发现分类任务利用'Elsewhere'概念实现学习否定；分割依赖边界检测器形成连贯子空间；深度估计使用三种单眼深度线索。表示部分密集而非严格稀疏，具有低维局部连接结构，基于原型凸组合形成。

Conclusion: 提出了Minkowski表示假说，认为token是由原型（如动物中的兔子、颜色中的棕色、纹理中的毛绒）的凸组合形成的，这种结构基于Gardenfors概念空间理论，为解释视觉Transformer表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

TL;DR: 提出PhyDAE方法，通过两阶段级联架构将退化信息从隐式特征转化为显式决策信号，能够精确识别和处理多种异构退化（雾霾、噪声、模糊、低光），在三个基准数据集上全面超越现有方法，同时显著降低参数数量和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化恢复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理的显式建模，难以处理遥感图像获取过程中复杂的异构退化问题。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，包含残差流形投影器(RMP)和频率感知退化分解器(FADD)进行退化特征分析，引入物理感知专家模块和温度控制稀疏激活策略。

Result: 在MD-RSID、MD-RRSHID和MDRS-Landsat三个数据集上的实验表明，PhyDAE在四种恢复任务中均取得最优性能，同时参数数量和计算复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: PhyDAE在性能和效率之间实现了最优平衡，为遥感图像退化恢复提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机中心的理解和生成是空间智能的两个基石，但通常被孤立研究。本文旨在开发一个统一的模型来弥合这一差距，扩展相机维度的空间感知能力。

Method: 提出将相机视为语言的新范式，训练在包含400万视觉-语言-相机三元组的大规模数据集Puffin-4M上，整合全局相机参数和像素级相机映射，结合语言回归和扩散生成方法。

Result: 实验表明Puffin在相机中心生成和理解任务上优于专用模型，通过指令调优能够泛化到空间想象、世界探索和摄影指导等多样化的跨视角任务。

Conclusion: Puffin通过统一的相机中心多模态方法，在空间智能研究中取得了显著进展，将发布代码、模型、数据集管道和基准以推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

TL;DR: 提出结构化输出正则化(SOR)框架，通过冻结内部网络结构并使用组套索和L1惩罚，在少样本医学影像分类任务中取得竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习冻结部分权重并添加任务特定层，虽然计算高效但限制了模型适应领域特定特征的能力，在数据有限时仍可能导致过拟合。

Method: SOR框架冻结内部网络结构(如卷积滤波器)，同时使用组套索和L1惩罚的组合，仅需最小额外参数即可定制模型。

Result: 在三个少样本医学影像分类任务中，使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4基础网络，相比已有基准取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: SOR是一个简单有效的框架，易于应用于各种网络组件，为迁移学习任务提供了广泛适用性。

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

Conclusion: BEAR基准测试揭示了多模态大语言模型在具身能力方面的不足，BEAR-Agent能有效增强这些能力，且改进具身能力有益于模拟环境中的具身任务。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出一种基于生物视觉机制（中央-外周处理、眼跳运动、皮层填充）的对抗防御框架，通过强化学习引导的眼跳选择性采样多视角图像，重构后进行分类，无需重新训练分类器即可提升系统鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗防御方法依赖计算密集型优化，而人类视觉系统通过进化机制天然具备对抗扰动的鲁棒性。假设注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码是这种鲁棒性的关键。

Method: 结合三种生物机制：中央-外周处理、眼跳运动和皮层填充。使用强化学习引导的眼跳选择性捕获多个中央-外周视角，将这些视角整合成重构图像后进行图像分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法能提升多种分类器和攻击类型下的系统鲁棒性，同时显著降低训练开销。

Conclusion: 生物启发的预处理方法能有效缓解对抗噪声，保持语义完整性，无需下游分类器的重新训练或微调，可与现有系统无缝集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

Motivation: 现有视频质量评估模型存在三个主要问题：(1) 在不同内容和任务间泛化能力差，包括用户生成内容、短视频和AI生成内容；(2) 可解释性有限；(3) 缺乏对新用例或内容类型的可扩展性。

Method: 提出Q-Router框架，集成多样化专家模型，使用视觉语言模型作为实时路由器，根据输入视频语义动态推理并集成最合适的专家模型。构建基于计算预算的多层级路由系统，最重层级包含特定的时空伪影定位以实现可解释性。

Conclusion: Q-Router通过智能设计结合了专业专家模型的互补优势，在异构视频源和任务中实现了灵活性和鲁棒性，有望成为下一代VQA系统的基础，并具有作为视频生成模型后训练奖励函数的潜力。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等广泛使用的Med-VQA数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一的模态对齐、有效的硬负样本处理和选择性知识融合，显著提升了Med-VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkipSR是一个加速视频超分辨率的方法，通过识别低细节区域并跳过这些区域的计算，只对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理，显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的超分辨率方法计算成本高且速度慢，限制了在高分辨率和长视频中的应用。许多视频区域本身细节较少，不需要精细处理，但现有方法对所有像素进行统一处理。

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，完全跳过这些区域的计算，只对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在标准SR基准测试中，该方法在720p视频上比现有模型端到端延迟减少高达60%，且没有可感知的质量损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR通过选择性处理策略有效加速视频超分辨率，在保持感知质量的同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

*Yiyang Huang,Yizhou Wang,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-CoDe是一个无需训练的视频大语言模型适配框架，通过动态压缩和问题分解解决图像VLMs扩展到视频领域时的感知瓶颈和token过载问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将图像预训练的视觉语言模型扩展到视频领域面临挑战，因为需要处理密集且时间延长的视觉输入，这超出了图像模型的能力。主要问题是感知瓶颈和token过载。

Method: 提出动态压缩（自适应选择代表性帧和内容感知的空间token聚合）来缓解感知瓶颈，同时使用问题分解（将原始查询重新表述为子问题）来减轻token过载。

Result: 实验表明D-CoDe在各种基准测试中有效提升了视频理解能力，在具有挑战性的长视频基准上表现出色，展示了处理复杂视频语言任务的潜力。

Conclusion: D-CoDe框架成功解决了视频大语言模型适配中的关键挑战，为图像VLMs扩展到视频领域提供了一种有效的无需训练解决方案。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

*Hongrui Wu,Zhicheng Gao,Jin Cao,Kelu Yao,Wen Shen,Zhihua Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FOLK方法，通过标签引导的知识蒸馏实现快速开放词汇3D实例分割，避免2D遮挡噪声并显著加速推理过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D实例映射到2D RGB-D图像，然后使用视觉语言模型进行分类，但这种方法会引入2D遮挡噪声，且在推理时产生大量计算和内存成本，降低推理速度

Method: 设计教师模型提取高质量实例嵌入，通过标签引导的蒸馏算法将开放词汇知识蒸馏到3D学生模型中，学生模型可直接从3D点云分类实例

Result: 在ScanNet200数据集上达到AP50 35.7的SOTA性能，推理速度比之前方法快6.0倍到152.2倍

Conclusion: FOLK方法通过知识蒸馏有效解决了开放词汇3D实例分割中的遮挡噪声和推理效率问题，实现了高性能和高效率的平衡

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自监督视觉变换器的作物生长监测方法，无需手动标注即可学习蔓越莓生长的时间演化特征，并能预测生长趋势和区分不同品种的时间差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蔓越莓种植中的变化监测通常需要人工完成，耗时且效率低。深度学习虽有潜力，但存在特征难以解释和需要大量标注数据的问题。

Method: 使用自监督方法微调视觉变换器，通过时间回归和类别预测的双重预训练任务学习植物和果实外观的时间演化潜在空间。

Result: 生成的2D时间轨迹提供了可解释的作物生长时间序列模型，能够预测生长趋势并区分不同蔓越莓品种的时间差异。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可应用于其他作物和场景，并提供了包含8个品种、52次观测的新时间序列数据集。

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

*Daiki Yoshikawa,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP提出了一种使用双曲空间ℓ₁-乘积度量的视觉语言模型，能够同时表达概念层次结构和跨概念组合性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型难以同时表达概念家族内的层次结构（如狗≤哺乳动物≤动物）和跨概念家族的组合性（如"车里的狗"≤狗、车），双曲空间虽能有效捕捉树状层次结构，但其对组合性的表达能力尚不明确。

Method: PHyCLIP在双曲因子的笛卡尔积上使用ℓ₁-乘积度量，概念家族内层次在单个双曲因子中形成，跨概念组合通过ℓ₁-乘积度量捕获，类似于布尔代数。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的实验表明，PHyCLIP优于现有的单空间方法，并在嵌入空间中提供了更可解释的结构。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP通过双曲空间的乘积度量成功解决了同时表达层次结构和组合性的难题，为多模态表示学习提供了更强大的框架。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegTrans是一种新颖的迁移攻击框架，通过将输入样本划分为多个局部区域并重新映射语义信息来生成增强样本，显著提高了分割模型间对抗样本的迁移成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分割模型在白盒设置下对对抗样本具有显著脆弱性，但现有攻击方法在不同分割模型间的迁移性较差。复杂的上下文依赖性和特征分布差距导致迁移成功率不理想。

Method: 将输入样本划分为多个局部区域，重新映射语义信息生成多样化增强样本，用这些增强样本替代原始样本进行扰动优化，仅保留局部语义信息而非全局信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes两个基准数据集、四种分割模型和三种骨干网络上，SegTrans显著提高了对抗迁移成功率，平均提升8.55%，计算效率提高超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans通过局部语义信息重映射有效解决了分割模型间对抗样本迁移性差的问题，在不增加计算开销的情况下显著提升了攻击成功率。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

### [33] [Defense against Unauthorized Distillation in Image Restoration via Feature Space Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08925)
*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ASVP方法，通过奇异值分解对教师模型的内部特征图进行结构化扰动，有效防御图像恢复模型的知识蒸馏攻击，在多个任务中显著降低学生模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要针对图像分类任务，难以扩展到图像恢复任务。图像恢复是生成任务，具有连续高维输出，需要空间一致性和细节保持，轻微扰动不足以阻止学生模型学习。

Method: ASVP方法在运行时对教师模型的内部特征图进行奇异值分解，放大前k个奇异值来注入结构化的高频扰动，破坏蒸馏所需的对齐关系，同时保持教师模型输出质量。

Result: 在超分辨率、低光增强、水下增强、去雾和去雨五个图像恢复任务中，ASVP将学生模型的PSNR降低高达4dB，SSIM降低60-75%，对教师模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ASVP为保护开源图像恢复模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏提供了实用解决方案，相比现有方法提供更强且更一致的防御效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解任务中表现出色，但其在面对被操纵视频内容时的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 创建Ro-Bench基准，包含通过编辑风格、物体、背景及其组合生成的高质量、多样且时间相关的反事实视频数据，评估了8个最新视频MLLM。

Result: 当前模型在反事实视频内容上表现出显著性能下降，但使用反事实数据微调后，在Ro-Bench上性能提升21.73%，在MVBench的20个任务上提升12.78%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据能有效增强MLLM的视频理解能力，强调了评估和改进模型鲁棒性的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

<details>

Motivation: 农业监测系统依赖多源数据，但无人机动物健康监测面临数据稀缺问题，传统迁移学习方法因缺乏反映特定农场条件的大型数据集而失效，需要针对动物监测的特定数据增强策略。

Method: 开发物体聚焦数据增强框架，从背景中分割动物，通过变换和基于扩散的合成技术创建真实多样的场景，增强动物检测和监测性能。

Result: 初步实验表明，增强后的数据集在动物检测任务上比基线模型表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成领域特定数据，即使在数据稀缺情况下也能支持实时动物健康监测解决方案，弥合有限数据与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)范式，通过鼓励丰富的token感知并将复杂感知问题分解为可处理的子问题，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型的视觉感知精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的推理时间缩放方法在提升LVLMs推理能力方面取得了成功，但其对视觉感知的影响尚不明确。研究发现LVLMs在视觉估计任务中精度有限，推理时间缩放仅带来边际收益。

Method: 提出Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)范式，通过token丰富的感知和问题分解，使感知与推理时间缩放对齐；结合强化学习技术进行优化。

Result: PTS显著提升了感知精度，在DisTANCE基准上的高精度性能从8.0%提升至64.7%，在领域外任务上泛化良好；即使使用纯合成数据，与数学推理数据结合也能在推理和真实世界感知基准上获得一致提升。

Conclusion: PTS范式通过增加感知相关token和提升模型对图像token的关注，有效解决了当前LVLMs快速感知范式的局限性，为视觉感知任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过为预训练的毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加关节描述符，显式估计关节被感知的可能性及其位置预测的可靠性，从而提高可解释性和下游任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波姿态估计中，稀疏信号和弱反射导致模型从统计先验而非传感器数据推断身体关节，这种对先验的过度依赖会降低手势和活动识别等下游任务的性能。

Method: 引入mmJoints框架，为预训练的黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器输出增强额外的关节描述符，显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测的可靠性。

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置中超过115,000个信号帧的评估显示，mmJoints描述符估计错误率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提升达12.5%，活动识别性能提升达16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过显式量化姿态估计中的偏差，有效提高了毫米波姿态估计的可解释性和下游任务性能。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: HiMIR是一个高效的多模态图像检索调度框架，通过分层检索和减少冗余计算，在提高准确性的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法在检索准确性上存在局限，现有的多向量检索方法虽然通过分解查询和图像分割提高了准确性，但仍面临对齐不足和冗余计算的问题。

Method: 提出分层检索范式，使用多个中间粒度处理不同图像对象以增强对齐；利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性减少冗余匹配计算；自动为不同数据集配置参数。

Result: HiMIR不仅显著提高了检索准确性，还将计算量减少了高达3.5倍。

Conclusion: HiMIR框架通过分层设计和冗余优化，在多模态图像检索中实现了准确性和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在复杂局部区域（特别是人手）的细节生成上存在困难，生成的手部常出现结构扭曲和不真实纹理，但手部质量评估研究仍被忽视。

Method: 构建HandPair数据集（48k高-低质量手部图像对），开发HandEval模型，结合多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力和手部关键点先验知识。

Result: HandEval在人工标注测试集上比现有SOTA方法更符合人类判断，在图像生成和AIGC检测应用中分别显著提升了手部真实性和检测准确率。

Conclusion: HandEval是首个专门针对生成手部质量评估的有效方法，在下游应用中展现出普遍有效性。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

TL;DR: 提出了首个防御性范例"不可着色样本"，通过在灰度图像中嵌入不可察觉的扰动来阻止未经授权的AI着色，保护版权内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI着色技术存在版权侵权风险，如未经授权对黑白漫画和电影进行着色并转售，但目前缺乏有效的防护方法。

Method: 提出PAChroma方法，使用拉普拉斯滤波器优化不可察觉的扰动以保持感知质量，并在优化过程中应用多样化的输入变换来增强跨模型迁移性和对后处理的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低着色质量，同时保持视觉外观。

Conclusion: 这是保护视觉内容免受非法AI着色的首个步骤，为生成媒体中的版权感知防御开辟了道路。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2)框架，通过将去噪过程融入Jacobi迭代，实现自回归模型的并行token生成，显著加速图像生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归文本到图像模型由于顺序token解码过程导致推理速度缓慢，通常需要数千次模型前向传递来生成单张图像，需要解决这种效率低下的问题。

Method: 引入下一干净token预测范式，使预训练自回归模型能够接受噪声扰动的token嵌入，通过低成本微调预测下一干净token。在推理时用高斯噪声初始化token序列，在嵌入空间进行迭代的下一干净token预测，使用概率准则并行验证和接受多个token。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够通过减少模型前向传递次数来加速生成，同时保持生成图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: SJD2框架成功地将去噪过程与Jacobi迭代相结合，实现了自回归模型的并行token生成，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了生成效率。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，即生成图像中不存在的物体描述。研究发现视觉编码器中不确定的视觉token是导致幻觉的关键因素。

Method: 提出对抗扰动方法识别不确定视觉token，并在视觉编码器的中间层自注意力过程中掩码这些token，抑制其对视觉编码的影响。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著减少了大视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉，并能与其他现有方法协同工作。

Conclusion: 通过修改视觉编码器来识别和掩码不确定视觉token，是缓解物体幻觉问题的简单有效策略。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

Motivation: 当前自回归图像生成模型存在采样问题，图像token相比文本token信息密度更低且空间分布不均匀，需要更高效的解码策略。

Method: 1) 基于token分布空间熵的动态温度控制，平衡内容多样性、对齐精度和结构连贯性；2) 推测解码中的熵感知接受规则，以约85%的推理成本实现近乎无损的生成。

Result: 在多个基准测试和多样化AR图像生成模型上的广泛实验证明了该方法在提升生成质量和采样速度方面的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 所提出的熵信息解码策略能够显著提升自回归图像生成的质量和效率，为AR图像生成提供了有效的优化方案。

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DGLSS-NL任务，即在噪声标签下的LiDAR语义分割领域泛化问题，并开发了DuNe双视图框架，通过强-弱分支特征一致性约束和置信度感知过滤，在多个数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR标注存在噪声问题，且在领域偏移下噪声影响会被放大，威胁自动驾驶系统的可靠性。现有噪声标签学习方法在3D LiDAR分割中的领域泛化应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出DuNe双视图框架，包含强分支和弱分支，通过特征级一致性约束和基于置信度过滤的交叉熵损失来处理噪声标签。

Result: 在10%对称标签噪声下，在SemanticKITTI上达到56.86% mIoU，nuScenes上42.28%，SemanticPOSS上52.58%，算术平均49.57%，调和平均48.50%。

Conclusion: DuNe框架在DGLSS-NL任务中表现出强大的领域泛化能力，为解决LiDAR语义分割中的噪声标签问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is
available on our project page.

Conclusion: 该后训练策略易于适配预训练模型，在医学图像转换任务中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效利用多模态知识提升单模态网络性能，无需在测试时使用多模态输入

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse

of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than
state-of-the-art SRC methods. The source code is available at:

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit通过有效的局部几何建模显著提升了点云法向量估计的性能，为细粒度几何理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

Result: 将大型扩散变换器转换为MoE结构，激活参数减少60%的同时保持原始性能，在广泛实验中超越基于剪枝的方法。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,

Result: 在10万张合成图像上训练的模型在检测和视觉定位任务上超越了GRIT(2000万)和V3Det(20万)等更大真实数据集，在LVIS检测上提升+10.9 AP，在gRefCOCO视觉定位上提升+8.4 N_Acc。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控数据集构建，在低数据和封闭词汇设置下均能提升泛化能力，为具有挑战性的类内视觉定位提供针对性数据生成能力。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多模态语义扩散模型MSDM，通过整合细胞核形态、颜色特征和元数据生成像素级精确的图像-掩码对，用于增强细胞和细胞核分割数据集的多样性，显著提升分割模型的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中标注数据稀缺，特别是罕见或非典型形态的细胞和细胞核，手动标注成本高昂，合成数据提供了一种经济有效的替代方案。

Method: 使用多模态语义扩散模型MSDM，通过水平/垂直映射图表示细胞核形态、RGB颜色特征和BERT编码的元数据，利用多头交叉注意力整合这些异质模态，生成具有所需形态特征的图像-掩码对。

Result: 合成图像与真实数据高度匹配，在匹配生物条件下生成图像与真实图像的嵌入具有低Wasserstein距离。添加合成样本（如柱状细胞）显著提高了分割模型在柱状细胞上的准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态扩散增强策略有效提升了细胞和细胞核分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为生成模型在计算病理学中的广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

*Satya P. Singh,Rashmi Chaudhry,Anand Srivastava,Jagath C. Rajapakse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSepT是一种可分离的正交变换，通过张量积构造DCT径向基和傅里叶谐波角向基，解决了极坐标中的不可分离性问题，显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的正交矩图像表示方法存在高计算复杂度和数值不稳定问题，特别是在大阶数时，Zernike和伪Zernike矩需要耦合的径向-角向处理，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出PSepT变换，通过张量积构造离散余弦变换径向基和傅里叶谐波角向基，实现完全核分解，支持独立的径向和角向处理。

Result: PSepT将计算复杂度降至O(N² log N)，内存需求降至O(N²)，条件数缩放降至O(√N)，相比多项式方法有指数级改进，具有更好的数值稳定性和计算效率。

Conclusion: PSepT的可分离框架使得之前经典方法无法实现的高阶矩分析成为可能，为稳健的图像分析应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性方法通常单独分析输入特征或训练样本影响，需要将两者结合研究以更好理解深度模型内部机制

Method: 训练特征归因方法，通过关联测试预测与特定训练图像的具体区域来分析模型行为

Result: 在视觉数据集上的实验表明，该方法能识别导致错误分类的有害样本，揭示传统归因方法无法发现的虚假相关性

Conclusion: 训练特征归因提供了细粒度、测试特定的解释，能够暴露模型中的捷径学习和虚假相关性

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

TL;DR: 提出基于图像的气管镜拓扑定位管道，无需患者CT扫描即可在手术中提供导航辅助，仅在虚拟数据上训练，在真实数据测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统气管镜导航依赖患者CT扫描和额外传感器，成本高且需要专门训练。拓扑定位相对于精确度量定位通常已足够，且能避免额外设置和扫描。

Method: 开发基于图像的气管镜拓扑定位管道，仅使用虚拟数据进行训练，无需真实患者CT扫描，通过图像分析实现支气管树中的位置识别。

Result: 该方法在真实数据测试序列中表现优异，超越了现有方法，展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的图像基气管镜拓扑定位方法有效降低了导航辅助的成本和复杂性，在虚拟数据训练下具有良好的实际应用性能。

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需真实图像、通过合成生成多样化对象实例的方法来解决实例级识别(ILR)中的数据标注难题，显著提升了跨多个领域的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实例级识别需要识别单个对象而非类别，但细粒度特性使得大规模标注数据集创建困难，限制了ILR在实际应用中的广泛使用。

Method: 通过合成方法从多个领域生成多样化对象实例，在不同条件和背景下形成大规模训练集，无需依赖任何真实图像，然后在基础视觉模型上进行微调。

Result: 在七个跨多个领域的ILR基准测试中，检索性能显著提升，为广泛的实际应用提供了新的可能性。

Conclusion: 该方法为ILR引入了一种新的范式，仅需目标领域名称作为输入，提供了一种高效且有效的替代广泛数据收集和整理的方法。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

### [59] [TARO: Toward Semantically Rich Open-World Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09173)
*Yuchen Zhang,Yao Lu,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO是一个新颖的开放世界目标检测框架，不仅能识别未知物体，还能将其分类到语义层次结构中的粗粒度父类别，相比传统方法仅标记为'Unknown'更具实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标检测器局限于'封闭世界'假设，只能识别预定义类别，在遇到真实世界中的未知物体时存在风险。传统开放集检测方法将所有未知物体统一标记为'Unknown'不够实用，特别是在安全关键场景中需要更细粒度的分类信息。

Method: TARO采用独特架构：基于sparsemax的头部建模物体性，层次引导的重标记组件提供辅助监督，分类模块学习层次关系。通过语义层次结构将未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度父类别。

Result: 实验表明TARO能将高达29.9%的未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度类别，显著减少未知与已知类别间的混淆，在未知召回率和已知mAP方面均取得竞争性性能。

Conclusion: TARO框架成功解决了开放世界目标检测中的细粒度未知物体分类问题，为安全关键应用提供了更实用的决策信息。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

TL;DR: 提出了在线视频深度估计方法oVDA，通过借鉴LLM的缓存和掩码技术，解决了VDA只能批量处理的问题，在精度和VRAM使用上优于现有在线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Video Depth Anything (VDA)方法虽然性能优秀，但依赖批量处理，无法应用于在线场景。需要开发能够在实时环境中运行的单目视频深度估计方法。

Method: 借鉴大型语言模型的技术，在推理时缓存潜在特征，在训练时使用帧掩码技术，实现高效的在线视频深度估计。

Result: oVDA在精度和VRAM使用上均优于所有竞争方法，在NVIDIA A100上达到42 FPS，在NVIDIA Jetson边缘设备上达到20 FPS。

Conclusion: oVDA成功实现了高效的在线视频深度估计，特别适合在VRAM受限的边缘设备上部署，为实时计算机视觉系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP是一个基于多模态深度学习框架的牛只行为识别系统，通过语义线索提升视频特征识别性能，在监督学习下达到96.1%的准确率，并在少样本场景中表现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 牛只行为是动物健康、生产力和整体福祉的重要指标。视频监测结合深度学习已成为动物生物识别的主流方法，但现有方法在数据稀缺的行为识别方面存在不足，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 基于大规模图像-语言模型CLIP进行适配，添加时间整合模块，采用定制化数据增强策略和专门设计的文本提示，以弥合预训练模型与真实牛只监控视频之间的领域差距。

Result: 在监督设置下，Cattle-CLIP在六种行为上达到96.1%的总体准确率，其中进食、饮水和站立反刍行为的召回率接近100%。在少样本场景中表现出稳健的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中具有巨大潜力，Cattle-CLIP为数据稀缺的行为识别提供了有效解决方案，并发布了CattleBehaviours6数据集以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，用于提升光子效率成像中的3D重建性能，包括LOS和NLOS成像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间分辨系统中由于传感器量子效率低和噪声水平高导致的3D重建挑战，特别是在长距离或复杂场景下。

Method: 设计了专门针对时空瞬态测量的注意力机制：时空自注意力编码器探索局部和全局相关性，时空交叉注意力解码器在token空间中整合局部和全局特征。

Result: 在合成数据和不同成像系统捕获的真实数据上，TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS都显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TRT架构有效提升了光子效率成像的3D重建性能，并贡献了大规模合成数据集和真实NLOS测量数据，促进了该领域的数据多样性。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are

Method: 提出混合运动视频诊断框架(HMVDx)，使用两个多模态大语言模型分别完成动作理解和疾病诊断任务，并引入基于医疗决策逻辑的可用性指标。

Result: HMVDx在肩关节损伤诊断中的准确率比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了低成本多模态大语言模型在医疗应用中的潜力，为未来医学视频理解研究做出重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

### [67] [Stable Video Infinity: Infinite-Length Video Generation with Error Recycling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09212)
*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Stable Video Infinity (SVI)方法，能够生成无限长度视频，具有高时间一致性、合理的场景转换和可控的流式故事情节。通过错误回收微调技术，让Diffusion Transformer从自身生成的错误中学习，解决了训练假设与自回归推理之间的差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法主要关注减轻累积误差，但仍局限于单一提示词外推，产生同质化场景和重复运动。核心挑战在于训练时使用干净数据与推理时依赖自生成误差输出之间的假设差距。

Method: 采用错误回收微调：1) 注入历史错误干预干净输入，模拟误差累积轨迹；2) 使用一步双向积分高效近似预测，通过残差计算误差；3) 动态将误差存入跨离散时间步的重放记忆库，供新输入重采样使用。

Result: SVI能够将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，无需额外推理成本，同时兼容多种条件（音频、骨骼、文本流）。在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和最先进性能。

Conclusion: SVI通过错误回收微调有效解决了长视频生成中的假设差距问题，实现了无限长度视频生成，在一致性、创意性和条件控制方面均表现出色。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

*Yuying Li,Siyi Qian,Hao Liang,Leqi Zheng,Ruichuan An,Yongzhen Guo,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CapGeo框架，通过将几何图形转换为文本描述来提升多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力，并创建CapGeo-Bench基准数据集进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的多模态大语言模型在几何推理方面表现不佳，瓶颈在于理解几何图形而非推理本身。由于几何图形可以用简洁文本描述，将视觉内容转换为标题是一个有前景的方向。

Method: 引入CapGeo框架，通过辅助标题连接视觉和文本模态。创建CapGeo-Bench数据集（4,641个图形-标题对）和基于关键点的评估指标来系统评估几何标题生成模型。

Result: 配备标题后模型性能显著提升：Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升到59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升到73.0%。关键点评估指标与下游CapGeo性能强相关。

Conclusion: CapGeo框架和基准为推进多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出TEMA-LLM框架，利用大语言模型生成语义标签，通过多注意力机制建模跨域用户偏好，在电商推荐系统中取得优异效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域序列推荐系统需要准确捕捉域内和跨域行为模式，以提供个性化消费体验。现有方法在语义理解和跨域建模方面存在局限。

Method: 使用LLM生成领域感知的语义标签，将标签嵌入与项目标识符、文本和视觉特征融合，构建增强的项目表示，并引入标签增强的多注意力机制联合建模域内和跨域用户偏好。

Result: 在四个大规模电商数据集上的实验表明，TEMA-LLM持续优于最先进的基线方法，验证了LLM语义标签和多注意力集成的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LLM在推进消费电子领域智能、用户中心服务方面的潜力，为跨域推荐系统提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 森林管理中的机器人技术面临复杂自然环境感知的挑战，现有数据集主要关注城市环境或物种数量有限，无法满足精确林业、生物多样性监测和林业设备自动化对先进感知能力的需求。

Method: 在加拿大魁北克的五个生物气候区域收集林下图像，由林业专家对1476棵树和24个物种进行标注，创建SilvaScenes数据集，并使用现代深度学习方法进行实例分割基准测试。

Result: 树木分割相对容易，最高平均精度(mAP)达到67.65%，但物种分类仍然具有挑战性，mAP仅为35.69%。

Conclusion: SilvaScenes数据集填补了森林环境感知数据集的空白，证明了树木分割的可行性，但树种分类仍需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

Method: 提出临床基础的评估任务和指标定义方法，构建标准化评估框架软件，评估最先进算法在异构复杂任务上的表现。

Result: 发现最小化交互信息损失对模型鲁棒性关键；自适应缩放提升鲁棒性和收敛速度；验证提示行为/预算与训练不一致时性能下降；2D方法在板状图像和粗目标表现好，3D上下文对大/不规则目标有帮助；非医学域模型在对比度差和复杂形状时性能下降。

Conclusion: 建立了临床现实的交互式分割评估标准，揭示了关键设计因素对模型性能的影响，为开发鲁棒、通用的医学图像分割算法提供了指导。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

TL;DR: StreamingVLM是一个为实时理解无限视觉输入而设计的视觉语言模型，通过统一的训练-推理对齐框架，使用KV缓存重用和注意力机制优化，在长视频处理中实现稳定实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理无限视频流时面临计算成本高、延迟大和内存使用激增的问题，需要一种能够实时稳定理解长视频的解决方案。

Method: 采用统一的训练-推理对齐框架，在推理时维护紧凑的KV缓存（重用注意力sink状态、近期视觉token和文本token），通过简单的监督微调策略在短重叠视频块上应用完整注意力来模拟推理时注意力模式。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中，StreamingVLM对GPT-4O mini的胜率达到66.18%，在单张NVIDIA H100上保持高达8 FPS的稳定实时性能，同时在LongVideoBench和OVOBench Realtime上分别提升4.30和5.96分。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM成功解决了长视频处理的实时性和稳定性问题，其SFT策略不仅提升了流式处理能力，还增强了通用VQA能力，为实时助手和自主代理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

TL;DR: 本文通过建立零样本基准测试，系统比较了大型视觉语言模型与专用模型在图像隐私预测任务上的表现，发现尽管VLMs资源消耗大，但在隐私预测准确率上仍落后于专用小模型，不过对图像扰动的鲁棒性更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献倾向于采用通用的大型视觉语言模型进行图像隐私预测，但缺乏系统评估，可能忽视了专用模型的性能上限。本文旨在通过公平比较来解决这一问题。

Method: 建立零样本图像隐私分类基准，使用任务对齐的提示词评估前3名开源VLMs，并将其性能、效率和鲁棒性与已建立的视觉专用和多模态方法进行对比。

Result: 反直觉地发现，尽管VLMs参数多、推理慢、资源密集，但在隐私预测准确率上仍落后于专用小模型；但VLMs对图像扰动表现出更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 大型视觉语言模型目前在图像隐私预测任务上尚未超越专用模型，但其在鲁棒性方面具有优势，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

TL;DR: 使用离散语义熵(DSE)检测和拒绝可能产生幻觉的问题，可以显著提高黑盒视觉语言模型在放射学图像视觉问答中的准确性。

Motivation: 解决黑盒视觉语言模型在放射学图像问答中产生幻觉的问题，提高诊断答案的可靠性。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和GPT-4.1模型，在温度1.0下对每个问题生成15次回答，通过双向蕴含检查将意义等价的回答分组，计算语义簇的相对频率得到DSE。过滤掉DSE高于0.3的问题后重新计算准确率。

Result: 在706个图像-问题对中，过滤高熵问题(DSE>0.3)后，GPT-4o的准确率从51.7%提升到76.3%(保留334个问题)，GPT-4.1从54.8%提升到63.8%(保留499个问题)，统计显著。

Conclusion: DSE通过量化语义不一致性，能够可靠地检测黑盒视觉语言模型中的幻觉，显著提高诊断答案准确性，为临床VLM应用提供有效的过滤策略。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Motivation: 现有LLM方法依赖手工启发式或外部关键帧模型，前者忽略时序线索，后者增加系统复杂性。需要更有效的时序推理和细粒度视觉理解方法。

Method: 1) 训练时使用专用[FIND]令牌进行关键时刻识别；2) 推理时采用Moment-Centric采样策略；3) 开发双向锚点更新传播机制提升跟踪稳定性。

Result: 提出的框架自然整合了关键时刻定位能力，避免了外部时间戳编码需求，同时保持了运动细节和全局上下文。

Conclusion: 该统一框架在RefVOS任务中实现了时序推理和视觉理解的更好结合，提供了更高效和稳定的分割解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Result: 在8个感知和推理基准测试中，VPPO相比领先的开源RL调优模型取得显著提升，在7B和32B模型规模上均验证了有效性

Conclusion: 为分析多模态RLVR建立了新的令牌级感知视角，并提出了一种新颖有效的优化策略来显著增强LVLMs的多模态推理能力

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

Motivation: 传统模型强调基于图像的显著性，但眼动的基本时空统计特性尚未充分探索。理解这些动态在注意力建模和视觉界面中有广泛应用。

Method: 进行大规模人类受试者实验，40名参与者观看50张多样化图像，使用高速眼动仪记录超过400万个注视点，分析注视轨迹统计特性，并训练CNN模型从图像输入预测注视热点图。

Result: 人类眼睛的注视轨迹遵循类似动物觅食的Levy行走模式，表明人类眼睛以最优效率方式寻找视觉信息。CNN模型能够准确再现新颖图像中的显著注视区域。

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循与自然觅食类似的统计规律，为通过生成和预测框架建模注视行为开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Hybrid-depth框架，通过整合CLIP和DINO基础模型来提升自监督单目深度估计性能，采用从粗到细的渐进学习策略，在KITTI基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法由于语义-空间知识提取不足而面临性能限制，需要更好的上下文信息提取方法。

Method: 1) 从CLIP和DINO聚合多粒度特征，在对比语言指导下设计代理任务进行深度感知特征对齐；2) 在粗特征基础上集成相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐来细化深度预测，可作为即插即用模块与现有MDE管道集成。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，该方法在所有指标上显著优于最先进方法，并有益于下游任务如BEV感知。

Conclusion: 通过语言指导聚合CLIP的语义上下文和DINO的空间细节，有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题，提升了自监督单目深度估计性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出IRCR-Net网络，通过实例感知一致性正则化机制改进半监督细胞核实例分割，解决标注数据稀缺和伪标签噪声问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像中细胞核实例分割对肿瘤微环境分析至关重要，但标注数据成本高且稀缺，现有半监督方法在实例级一致性正则化不足，缺乏病理结构先验知识利用，且训练中易引入噪声伪标签

Method: 提出匹配驱动实例感知一致性(MIAC)和先验驱动实例感知一致性(PIAC)机制，结合细胞核形态先验知识评估伪标签质量，丢弃低质量伪标签，增强高质量预测

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在多个公共数据集上显著提升半监督细胞核实例分割性能，在某些场景下甚至超越全监督方法

Conclusion: IRCR-Net通过实例感知一致性正则化和先验知识利用，有效解决了半监督细胞核分割中的伪标签噪声问题，实现了优异的性能表现

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为渐进提示融合网络（PPFN）的热红外图像增强方法，通过建立基于热成像过程的提示对来调制模型特征，结合选择性渐进训练机制处理单一或复合退化问题，并在新构建的高质量多场景红外基准上取得了显著性能提升。

Motivation: 现有红外图像增强方法主要针对单一退化问题，难以处理耦合退化；而通用增强方法由于成像模型差异在红外图像上效果有限。

Method: 提出渐进提示融合网络（PPFN），基于热成像过程建立提示对，通过融合相应提示对调制模型特征；引入选择性渐进训练（SPT）机制逐步优化模型对复合情况的处理。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能去除相机噪声并保留关键结构细节，还能增强热图像的整体对比度，在热红外图像增强任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出利用视觉语言模型进行多模态关键词预测，通过零样本、监督微调、Fine-tune-CoT和动态CoT策略来提升模型在复杂推理场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态方法在处理缺失和未见场景时存在显著局限性，现有基准测试因训练测试重叠度高而高估模型能力。

Method: 采用视觉语言模型，首先评估零样本和监督微调的性能下限，然后使用Fine-tune-CoT提升复杂推理能力，最后提出动态CoT策略解决"过度思考"问题。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的动态CoT策略能够有效提升视觉语言模型在多模态关键词预测任务中的性能，特别是在复杂推理场景下。

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLINK-Twice是一个视觉中心推理基准，专注于从纯视觉内容进行推理，超越了浅层感知，需要细粒度观察和分析推理。该基准包含七种视觉挑战、自然对抗图像对和带注释的推理链，对现有多模态大语言模型构成显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准主要评估基于语言的推理，将视觉输入视为可替换的上下文。为了填补这一空白，需要创建一个基于挑战性感知任务的视觉中心推理基准，要求模型仅从视觉内容进行推理。

Method: BLINK-Twice整合了三个核心组件：七种视觉挑战类型用于测试视觉推理、自然对抗图像对强制依赖视觉内容、带注释的推理链用于细粒度评估推理过程而非仅最终答案。评估了20个领先的MLLM，包括12个基础模型和8个推理增强模型。

Result: BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成显著挑战。现有的语言空间推理策略（如思维链或自我批评）可以提高性能，但往往导致不稳定和冗余的推理。重复图像观察能提高模型性能，像o3这样的模型展示的主动视觉交互突显了视觉推理新范式的需求。

Conclusion: BLINK-Twice基准揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在视觉推理方面的局限性，并强调了开发视觉推理新范式的必要性，特别是需要更有效的视觉交互和观察策略。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

TL;DR: VAD-GS是一个针对挑战性城市场景的3D高斯泼溅框架，通过体素化可见性推理、多样性感知视图选择和基于块匹配的多视图立体重建来恢复缺失的几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅的性能严重依赖于初始点云质量，在无边界动态城市场景中，由于观察视锥体不重叠，往往导致点云覆盖不均匀和不完整，从而产生失真和伪影。

Method: 通过体素化可见性推理识别不可靠几何结构，使用多样性感知视图选择信息丰富的支持视图，通过基于块匹配的多视图立体重建恢复缺失结构。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上的广泛实验表明，VAD-GS优于最先进的3DGS方法，显著提高了静态和动态对象重建几何的质量。

Conclusion: VAD-GS能够生成由可靠几何先验引导的新高斯基元，即使在缺乏初始点的区域也能有效恢复缺失结构，解决了现有3DGS方法在城市场景中的局限性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 准确的森林生物量量化对碳循环监测至关重要，但直接从LiDAR点云估计木质体积和地上生物量存在挑战，主要困难在于建模长程依赖关系以区分不同树木。

Method: 将Mamba模型的选择性状态空间模型集成到Minkowski网络中，有效编码全局上下文和长程依赖关系，并加入跳跃连接以增强特征和加速收敛。

Result: 在丹麦国家森林清单LiDAR数据上的评估显示，Minkowski-MambaNet显著优于现有最先进方法，提供更准确和稳健的估计。

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模森林生物量分析提供了强大工具，推进了基于LiDAR的森林清单技术，无需数字地形模型且对边界伪影具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的模型在视觉任务（如目标检测）中的推理效率仍然是一个挑战，特别是在DETR的MLP层中存在固有的稀疏性，需要开发方法来利用这种稀疏性而不需要重新训练整个模型。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1) SIBS：基于固定激活模式的启发式方法预测神经元不活跃性；2) MGS：在预训练DETR基础上训练的轻量级门控机制，使用小型线性层预测动态稀疏性。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的实验表明，MGS实现了85-95%的激活稀疏度，在保持或改进性能的同时显著减少了计算量。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，能够在不需要完整模型重新训练的情况下高效部署预训练的视觉Transformer。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Motivation: 从单目视频重建的4D场景基于文本提示进行编辑在内容创作和虚拟环境中具有广泛应用价值，但面临在复杂动态场景中实现语义精确编辑同时保持未编辑内容完整性的挑战。

Method: 使用量化CLIP特征增强3D高斯形成语言嵌入动态表示；提出两阶段点级定位策略：先通过CLIP相似度选择候选高斯，再精化空间范围；使用基于扩散的视频编辑模型进行目标编辑，通过流和涂鸦引导确保空间保真度和时间一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，Mono4DEditor能够在多样化场景和对象类型上实现高质量的文本驱动编辑，同时保持未编辑区域的外观和几何特性，在灵活性和视觉保真度方面超越先前方法。

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor框架成功解决了4D场景文本驱动编辑的挑战，实现了语义精确的局部编辑，同时保持场景的时空一致性，为动态场景编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用视觉状态空间块进行多帧对齐，恢复亮度、颜色和结构；第二阶段引入基于动态权重的时间聚合的循环细化模块，通过光流指导自适应平衡静态和动态区域。

Result: 在真实世界低光视频上的实验表明，DWTA-Net能有效抑制噪声和伪影，相比最先进方法提供更优的视觉质量。

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过联合利用短期和长期时间线索，在低光视频增强中取得了显著效果，特别是在噪声抑制和视觉质量提升方面。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Motivation: 虽然现代MLLMs在具身AI中利用其广泛常识进行高级规划，但它们对物理工具的真正理解程度尚未量化，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含1000多个图像-文本对的VQA数据集，评估32个MLLMs在三个难度层次上的表现：工具识别、工具理解和工具创造。

Conclusion: MLLMs在物理工具理解方面存在明显不足，需要进一步改进，作者提供了深入分析和初步解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 三星智能手机图像中的对角线伪影会影响PRNU相机源验证，但PRO模式下的RAW图像可避免此问题。这些伪影也可用于减少HDR误检和定位人像模式中的合成虚化区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究三星智能手机图像中的对角线伪影对PRNU相机源验证的影响，并探索这些伪影在法证应用中的潜在用途。

Method: 分析Galaxy S和A系列模型的图像伪影模式，比较普通图像和PRO模式RAW图像的PRNU验证效果。

Result: 发现某些Galaxy S系列模型存在导致指纹碰撞的共同模式，类似问题也出现在部分A系列中。RAW图像可避免伪影，但中端A系列不支持此功能。

Conclusion: 对角线伪影会影响PRNU验证，但RAW图像可解决此问题。这些伪影在法证应用中具有潜在价值，如减少HDR误检和定位合成虚化区域。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

*PeiHuang Zheng,Yunlong Zhao,Zheng Cui,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PRNet实时检测框架，通过渐进式细化模块和增强切片采样技术，有效解决航拍图像中小目标检测因特征提取过程中的信息退化问题，在多个数据集上实现优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航拍图像中的小目标检测由于像素表示有限，在特征提取过程中面临严重的信息退化问题。浅层空间细节无法与语义信息有效对齐，导致频繁漏检和误检。现有FPN方法通过后处理增强来缓解这些损失，但重建的细节往往偏离原始图像信息，阻碍与语义内容的融合。

Method: PRNet包含两个核心模块：渐进式细化颈部（PRN）通过骨干网络重用和迭代细化实现空间-语义对齐；增强切片采样（ESSamp）通过优化的重排和卷积操作在降采样过程中保留浅层信息。

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上的大量实验表明，PRNet在可比较的计算约束下优于最先进的方法，实现了优越的精度-效率权衡。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优先保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征，显著提升了小目标表示能力，为航拍图像中的小目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

TL;DR: FLOWING是一个基于微分向量流的形变框架，通过将形变建模为流构造来确保连续性、可逆性和时间一致性，在2D图像和3D形状形变中实现了最先进的形变质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多层感知机作为隐式神经表示进行形变建模时，需要昂贵的正则化，导致训练不稳定且难以有效对齐特征。

Method: 将形变重新定义为微分向量流的构造，将结构流属性直接编码到网络架构中，确保连续性、可逆性和时间一致性。

Result: 在面部和图像形变以及高斯泼溅形变等应用中，FLOWING实现了最先进的形变质量，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 基于流的形变方法能够产生原则性且稳定的变换，实现准确且结构保持的形变。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

*Minkyoung Cho,Ruben Ohana,Christian Jacobsen,Adityan Jothi,Min-Hung Chen,Z. Morley Mao,Ethem Can*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TC-LoRA是一种新的可控扩散模型范式，通过超网络动态生成LoRA适配器，在扩散过程的每个步骤中根据时间和用户条件调整模型权重，实现动态、上下文感知的控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可控扩散模型使用静态架构修改中间激活来注入新模态的指导，这种静态条件策略限制了模型在从粗结构到精细细节的生成过程中适应其响应的能力。

Method: 使用超网络实时生成LoRA适配器，为冻结的主干网络在每个扩散步骤中基于时间和用户条件定制权重修改，实现动态参数化控制。

Result: 在各种数据域的实验表明，这种动态参数化控制相比静态激活方法显著提高了生成保真度和空间条件遵循度。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA建立了一种替代方法，通过更深层次的权重功能适应来修改模型的条件策略，使控制能够与任务和生成阶段的动态需求保持一致。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSP-DETR是一个统一的生物医学检测框架，能够在单一模型中实现少样本检测、开放集识别和跨任务泛化，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学目标检测面临标注数据稀缺和新类别频繁出现的问题，现有方法通常孤立处理这些任务，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 基于类别无关的DETR骨干网络，通过原始支持图像构建类别原型，使用增强视图和轻量级transformer解码器学习嵌入空间，联合优化原型匹配损失、对齐分离损失和KL散度正则化。

Result: 在卵细胞、血细胞和疟疾检测任务上的广泛实验表明，FSP-DETR在少样本和开放集场景下显著优于现有方法，特别是在低样本情况下表现突出。

Conclusion: FSP-DETR提供了一个统一的检测框架，支持推理时的灵活性，能够识别未见类别、拒绝背景并实现跨任务适应，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Method: 对论文标题和摘要进行标准化处理，使用手工构建的词典匹配方法，分配最多35个主题标签，挖掘任务、架构、训练机制等细粒度线索。

Result: 发现多模态视觉-语言-LLM研究大幅增长，生成方法持续扩展，3D和视频研究保持活跃。参数高效适应和轻量级视觉-语言桥接成为主流，训练实践从零构建转向指令调优。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了计算机视觉和机器学习领域的重要趋势转变，多模态和生成方法成为主导，同时释放词典和方法论以支持审计和扩展。

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于蒸馏的框架，通过从预训练的小型动作模型转移知识，为视觉语言模型赋予动作执行能力，显著降低了训练成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言动作模型虽然能利用预训练视觉语言模型的感知能力，但从头训练成本高昂。本文旨在通过知识蒸馏方法，高效地为视觉语言模型添加动作执行能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：首先通过轻量级对齐将视觉语言模型的隐藏状态映射到小型动作模型的动作空间，然后选择性微调语言模型、状态编码器和动作模块。架构上仅添加动作令牌和状态编码器。

Result: 在LIBERO数据集上达到97.3%平均成功率（提升11.8%），在LIBERO-LONG上达到93.5%（提升24.5%）。在真实世界五个操作任务中达到82.0%成功率（提升17%），优于教师模型。

Conclusion: 动作蒸馏方法能有效使视觉语言模型生成精确动作，同时大幅降低训练成本，在模拟和真实环境中均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

Motivation: 大规模科学数据集为无特定研究问题的探索性发现创造了机会，需要支持在复杂假设空间中进行持续探索的框架

Method: 引入AScience框架，将发现建模为代理、网络和评估规范的交互，实现为ASCollab分布式系统，包含具有异质行为的LLM研究代理，这些代理自组织成演化网络，在共享评估标准下持续产生和同行评审发现

Result: 实验显示这种社交动态能够沿着多样性-质量-新颖性前沿积累专家评级结果，包括重新发现已建立的生物标志物、扩展已知通路以及提出新的治疗靶点

Conclusion: 虽然湿实验室验证仍然必不可少，但在癌症队列上的实验表明，社交结构化的代理网络可以大规模持续进行探索性假设搜索

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

Motivation: 印度电商市场快速增长，最后一公里配送占运营成本近一半，传统VRP求解器因非结构化地址、不完整地图和计算限制在现实场景中效果有限

Method: 使用大语言模型对VRP生成的路由进行政策标准评估，生成、标注和评估400个案例，比较开源和专有推理模型的性能

Result: 开源LLM识别路由问题准确率达79%，专有推理模型最高达86%，证明LLM评估VRP路线是有效且可扩展的方法

Conclusion: LLM为基础的VRP路线评估可超越传统距离和时间指标，提高成本效率、配送可靠性和可持续性，特别适用于印度等发展中国家

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模块化架构将导航规划与视觉世界建模分离，导致状态-动作不对齐，在动态场景中适应性有限。需要统一框架确保预测与控制紧密对齐。

Method: 提出UniWM统一模型，通过分层记忆机制整合短期感知线索和长期轨迹上下文，在单一多模态自回归主干中实现视觉预测和规划的统一。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，导航成功率提升高达30%，轨迹误差显著降低，在未见过的TartanDrive数据集上展现出优异的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM是实现统一、想象力驱动的具身导航的重要进展，证明了视觉预测与规划统一方法的有效性。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

Motivation: 现有使用LLM设计启发式方法的技术可能不够鲁棒，需要通过工具解释启发式方法表现不佳的原因并提供改进建议来增强其性能。

Method: 采用三种简单策略：(1)向LLM展示启发式方法表现不佳的实例；(2)解释这些表现不佳的原因；(3)针对输入空间的特定区域进行专门化设计。

Result: 与FunSearch相比，生成的启发式方法在最坏情况下性能提升约28倍，平均性能也有所改善，同时保持运行时间不变。

Conclusion: 通过向LLM提供失败案例分析和针对性设计，可以显著提升启发式方法的鲁棒性和性能表现。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个轻量级分层框架，通过将战术执行、战略监督和上下文管理分离为三个专门组件，解决了LLM代理在长时程任务中的上下文管理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程任务需要持续推理和多次工具交互，这对LLM代理具有挑战性：小错误会在步骤间累积，即使最先进的模型也经常产生幻觉或失去连贯性。上下文管理被识别为核心瓶颈。

Method: 提出COMPASS框架，包含三个专门组件：(1)主代理执行推理和工具使用，(2)元思考者监控进度并发出战略干预，(3)上下文管理器为不同推理阶段维护简洁相关的进度简报。

Result: 在GAIA、BrowseComp和Humanity's Last Exam三个具有挑战性的基准测试中，COMPASS相对于单代理和多代理基线准确率提高了高达20%。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过分层专业化组件有效解决了LLM代理在长时程任务中的上下文管理问题，并提供了测试时扩展和训练后流水线来进一步提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

TL;DR: 研究发现人类和AI在评估文学风格时都存在系统性偏见，AI比人类表现出更强的反AI偏见（2.5倍），这种偏见在不同AI架构间普遍存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作工具的普及，需要理解人类和机器如何评估文学风格这一主观领域，特别是关于作者归属的偏见问题。

Method: 使用雷蒙·格诺的《风格练习》进行对照实验，研究1比较人类参与者和AI模型在盲测、准确标注和反事实标注条件下的评估；研究2测试AI评估者和创作者之间的偏见泛化。

Result: 人类显示+13.7个百分点的偏见，AI模型显示+34.3个百分点的偏见（2.5倍更强）。AI系统在内容被标注为"AI生成"时系统性贬低创意内容，无论哪个AI创建。

Conclusion: AI模型在训练过程中吸收了人类对人工创造力的文化偏见，不仅复制而且放大了这种人类倾向，导致评估标准基于感知作者身份而颠倒。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

*Allison Sihan Jia,Daniel Huang,Nikhil Vytla,Nirvika Choudhury,John C Mitchell,Anupam Datta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Agent GPA评估框架，基于目标-计划-行动循环，包含五个评估指标：目标达成、逻辑一致性、执行效率、计划质量和计划遵循。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要系统化评估智能体性能，覆盖广泛的失败模式，支持错误定位和针对性改进。

Method: 开发基于目标-计划-行动循环的评估框架，包含五个评估指标，并在TRAIL/GAIA基准数据集和生产级数据智能体上进行实验验证。

Result: 框架能覆盖TRAIL/GAIA数据集中的所有智能体错误，LLM评估与人工标注高度一致（80%-95%），错误定位准确率达86%。

Conclusion: Agent GPA框架提供了系统化的智能体评估方法，能有效识别和定位智能体失败，支持性能改进。

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ReviewerToo框架，通过AI辅助同行评审来补充人类判断，在ICLR 2025数据集上达到81.8%的接受/拒绝分类准确率，接近人类评审员的83.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统同行评审存在的不一致性、评审员主观性和可扩展性挑战，通过AI辅助提高评审的系统性和一致性。

Method: 开发了模块化框架ReviewerToo，支持专门的评审员角色和结构化评估标准，可以部分或完全集成到真实会议工作流程中。

Result: 在ICLR 2025的1,963篇论文数据集上，AI评审员在事实核查、文献覆盖方面表现出色，但在评估方法新颖性和理论贡献方面仍有不足。AI生成的评审质量高于人类平均水平，但仍落后于最强专家。

Conclusion: AI可以增强评审的一致性、覆盖范围和公平性，但复杂评估仍需领域专家。为构建系统性混合同行评审系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

### [108] [GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872)
*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GTAlign框架，将博弈论决策整合到LLM的对齐过程中，通过构建收益矩阵和互惠奖励机制，使模型能够选择对用户和自身都有利的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法假设最大化模型奖励就能最大化用户福利，但实践中模型可能过度澄清或生成冗长推理，而用户更喜欢简洁答案，这类似于囚徒困境中的次优结果。

Method: 在推理阶段将用户-LLM交互视为策略博弈，构建收益矩阵评估双方福利；在训练阶段引入互惠奖励强化合作响应；还包含基于博弈论推理的动态适应技术。

Result: 广泛实验表明GTAlign相比基线方法显著提高了推理效率、答案质量和互惠福利。

Conclusion: GTAlign通过博弈论方法有效解决了LLM对齐中的互惠问题，实现了更好的用户-模型协作效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了LM Fight Arena框架，通过在格斗游戏《真人快打II》中让大型多模态模型相互对战，评估它们在实时对抗环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型基准测试往往无法捕捉它们在实时对抗环境中的真实性能，需要一种动态、可复现的评估方法。

Method: 在受控的锦标赛中测试六个领先的开源和闭源模型，每个模型控制相同角色以确保公平比较，通过解读游戏画面和状态数据来选择行动。

Result: LM Fight Arena提供了一个完全自动化、可复现且客观的评估框架，能够测试LMM在动态环境中的战略推理能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了一个具有挑战性和吸引力的基准测试，弥合了AI评估与互动娱乐之间的差距。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR是一个基于机制可解释性的框架，通过区分基于记忆和基于推理的模型响应来检测数据污染，在多样化评估集上达到93%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染对可靠的LLM评估构成重大挑战，模型可能通过记忆训练数据而非展示真正推理能力来获得高性能表现。

Method: RADAR提取37个特征，涵盖表面级置信度轨迹和深层机制特性（包括注意力专业化、电路动态和激活流模式），并使用这些特征训练的集成分类器。

Result: RADAR在多样化评估集上达到93%的准确率，在清晰案例上表现完美，在具有挑战性的模糊示例上达到76.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了机制可解释性在超越传统表面级指标的LLM评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估检索增强生成(RAG)管道的基准，包含多模态数据测试集、短语级召回指标、幻觉检测方法，并在开源和闭源系统上进行了比较评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注检索等特定方面，缺乏对RAG管道整体能力的评估，特别是在多模态信息处理方面的表现。

Method: 创建了93个多模态问题数据集，开发了短语级召回指标和基于最近邻嵌入的幻觉分类器，对2个开源和4个闭源系统进行了比较评估。

Result: 闭源管道在正确性和幻觉检测方面显著优于开源管道，特别是在多模态和跨文档问题上表现差距更大。人工评估显示指标与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: 该基准有效评估了RAG管道的整体能力，揭示了闭源系统在多模态信息处理上的优势，为未来RAG系统开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG是一个基于认知神经科学启发的实体中心知识图谱RAG框架，通过提取和存储核心实体及其元数据，在索引阶段减少94%的token消耗，并通过多跳关联检索和动态关系推断实现复杂问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类利用线索激活实体中心记忆痕迹进行复杂多跳回忆的认知神经机制启发，旨在开发更高效的RAG框架来处理复杂问答任务。

Method: 在索引阶段仅提取和存储核心实体及其元数据；检索时先提取查询中的线索实体，然后在知识图谱上进行可扩展的多跳关联搜索，动态推断实体间的隐式关系来填充上下文。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，将平均精确匹配(EM)分数从0.392提升到0.474，优于HippoRAG等强KG-RAG方法。

Conclusion: 实体-线索-多跳检索范式在复杂问答任务中具有显著效果，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualResearch是一个检索和融合框架，通过联合建模广度语义图和深度因果图来解决深度研究框架中的上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度研究框架虽然能协调外部工具进行复杂的多步骤科学推理，但仍存在上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱等问题。

Method: 提出DualResearch框架，联合建模两个互补图：编码稳定背景知识的广度语义图和捕获执行来源的深度因果图。每个图都有层原生相关性函数，广度图使用种子锚定语义扩散，深度图使用因果语义路径匹配和可靠性加权。通过熵门控规则在log空间融合答案分布。

Result: 在科学推理基准HLE和GPQA上取得有竞争力的性能。使用开源系统InternAgent的日志文件，在HLE上的准确率提高了7.7%，在GPQA上提高了6.06%。

Conclusion: DualResearch作为深度研究系统的补充，能够将冗长的多工具执行日志压缩为简洁的推理图，稳定有效地重建答案。

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT)方法，通过图神经网络提取语义条件并自适应融合知识，显著提升知识图谱补全任务的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前缀调优方法简单地将知识嵌入与文本输入拼接，忽略了知识图谱中丰富的语义关系，给大语言模型带来了隐式推理负担

Method: SCT包含两个关键模块：语义图模块使用图神经网络从局部图邻域中提取上下文感知的语义条件；条件自适应融合模块通过参数化投影器自适应地调节文本嵌入，实现深度、特征级的知识感知交互

Result: 在知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SCT显著优于前缀调优和其他强基线方法

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理前用语义图上下文调节输入表示，SCT提供了更直接和有效的信号，实现了更准确和鲁棒的知识推理

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

TL;DR: Tiny-R1V是一个轻量级3B参数的多模态大语言模型，通过两阶段优化实现更快的推理速度和更高的准确率，统一了多任务多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在推理效率方面面临模型尺寸大、过度思考、轻量级场景准确率低等挑战，而轻量级MLLMs的推理能力研究较为缺乏。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段引入LIPO强化学习方法，动态调整响应优势，鼓励生成更短更准确的响应；第二阶段提出AMM训练无关的模型融合方法，自适应调整任务向量权重并通过梯度投影正则化损失函数优化合并向量。

Result: 在十个广泛使用的推理基准测试（涵盖数学、结构化数据、OCR和通用能力）上表现出卓越性能，使轻量级模型在多样化多模态推理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V通过创新的两阶段优化方法，成功解决了轻量级MLLMs的推理效率问题，为轻量级多模态推理模型的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估LLMs旅行规划能力时，往往无法充分评估计划的可行性、可靠性和吸引力，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 开发了统一的旅行规划基准，将多个评估标准整合为单一奖励；创建了包含4870个查询的大规模数据集，其中219个是真实世界的自由形式请求；使用GRPO进行强化学习训练。

Result: 评估器与旅行专家标注达到了60.75%的一致性，优于多个LLM-as-judge基线；强化学习在基础模型上普遍提高了行程可行性，获得了更高的统一奖励分数。

Conclusion: 提出的基准能够有效评估旅行规划质量，强化学习方法在提升计划可行性方面表现出色，为旅行规划任务提供了更可靠的评估框架。

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了SOTA LLMs在证明评分方面的能力，发现虽然能可靠识别错误证明，但在部分学分分配上存在校准差距。为此提出了基于代理的工作流程，通过提取参考解和自动生成问题特定评分标准来改进评分过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在解决奥林匹克数学问题方面取得显著进展（如解决IMO 2025的大部分问题），需要评估这些模型在证明评分方面的能力，包括错误检测、严重性判断和公平评分。

Method: 使用包含90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成解的数据集（1-4分制）和MathArena的IMO/USAMO 2025解集（0-7分制）。引入代理工作流程，提取参考解并自动生成问题特定评分标准，进行多步骤评分过程。

Result: 模型能可靠标记错误（包括细微错误）证明，但在部分学分分配上存在校准差距。提出的工作流程在人类评分一致性和部分学分处理一致性方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 代理工作流程能显著提高LLMs在证明评分方面的表现，特别是在部分学分分配的一致性方面，为未来研究提供了代码、数据和提示/日志资源。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续记忆机制，通过VLM编码GUI轨迹为固定长度的连续嵌入，显著减少上下文成本并保留细粒度视觉信息，在长序列任务和分布偏移下提升GUI代理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理将历史轨迹压缩为文本标记，导致上下文长度膨胀且丢失关键视觉线索（如控件大小和位置），需要可扩展的记忆机制来泛化到陌生界面和长序列任务。

Method: 使用VLM作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，直接输入到骨干网络；引入自动扩展数据飞轮，通过搜索发现新环境、VLM合成任务、代理执行轨迹、VLM验证成功来低成本扩展记忆。

Result: 随着记忆大小和检索深度增加，性能单调提升；在真实GUI基准测试中，记忆增强代理在长序列和分布偏移下持续提高成功率；Qwen-2.5-VL-7B+连续记忆达到与GPT-4o、Claude-4等闭源模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 连续记忆机制能有效提升GUI代理的泛化能力，通过低成本数据收集和仅微调记忆编码器（1.2%参数），在真实场景中实现与顶级闭源模型竞争的性能。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究整合精神分析和MBTI人格理论构建人工意识模块，开发了三种意识（自我意识、潜意识、前意识）和16种MBTI人格角色，通过多维度评估验证了人工意识的人类认知相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型虽在多个领域取得进展，但由于幻觉问题难以模拟人类意识。本研究旨在通过结合精神分析和人格理论来构建更接近人类认知的人工意识系统。

Method: 基于精神分析理论开发三种人工意识模块，结合MBTI设计16种人格角色，创建10种不同情境进行评估，采用问卷调查、ChatGPT三级分类和定性分析三种评估方法。

Result: 定量和定性分析均表明人工意识具有高度模拟人类认知的可能性，尽管不同角色和意识之间的响应差异不够显著。

Conclusion: 整合精神分析和人格理论的模型能够构建更直观、适应性更强的人工意识系统，为改善AI在复杂认知情境中的交互开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

TL;DR: MEC³O是一个多专家共识系统，通过将LLM分配到不同复杂度类别并让它们进行结构化辩论，采用加权共识机制来预测代码时间复杂度，在CodeComplex数据集上显著优于开源基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在代码时间复杂度预测任务中表现不均衡，没有单一模型在所有复杂度类别上都表现优异，需要一种能够整合不同模型优势的方法。

Method: 提出MEC³O系统：1) 基于性能将LLM分配到不同复杂度类别；2) 为每个类别提供专业化指令；3) 专家模型进行结构化辩论；4) 通过加权共识机制整合预测结果。

Result: 在CodeComplex数据集上，MEC³O比开源基线模型准确率和macro-F1分数至少提高10%，在macro-F1上平均超过GPT-4o-mini，与GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini在F1分数上表现相当。

Conclusion: 多专家辩论和加权共识策略能有效生成最终预测，证明了该方法在代码复杂度预测任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、在推理时控制流式文本到图像模型的方法，通过特征空间目标和时间调度的随机扰动来增强生成多样性，同时保持图像质量和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，用户需要重复采样才能发现多样模式，这个过程成本高且效率低。

Method: 同时通过特征空间目标鼓励轨迹间的横向扩展，并通过时间调度的随机扰动重新引入不确定性。关键的是，该扰动被投影为与生成流正交，这种几何约束允许它在不降低图像细节或提示保真度的情况下增强变化。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续改进了Vendi Score和Brisque等多样性指标，同时保持了图像质量和对齐度。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种原理性解释，说明为何生成质量能够稳健保持，理论上显示能够单调增加体积代理，同时由于几何约束近似保持边际分布。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Method: 引入动态超图学习捕捉高阶非成对关系；提出物理数据双驱动动态预测模块，结合Koopman算子理论将非线性动力学微分方程转化为线性系统求解，利用物理信息神经微分方程确保动态演化符合物理规律。

Result: 在公共数据集和自建产业链网络数据集上的实验验证表明，该方法具有良好的预测准确性和长期预测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决复杂网络动态预测中的高阶关系捕捉和可解释性问题，实现了准确且可解释的长期动态预测。

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Stackelberg竞争理论的强化学习框架，用于训练LLM智能体在社交推理游戏中生成具有说服力的对话，显著提升了智能体的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在社交推理游戏中主要关注信息处理和策略选择，忽视了说服性沟通在影响其他玩家信念和反应方面的重要性。游戏成功不仅依赖正确推理，还需要说服他人按自己的意图行动。

Method: 将回合制对话形式化为Stackelberg竞争，当前玩家作为领导者战略性地影响跟随者的响应。基于此理论框架，提出了一个强化学习框架来训练智能体优化对话的说服力。

Result: 在三个不同的社交推理游戏中进行全面实验，证明该方法显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发具有战略性社会影响力AI智能体的重要进展，对需要说服性沟通的场景具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

Result: 在推理基准测试中，该方法能节省计算预算并控制用户指定的性能损失

Conclusion: PAC推理方法为高风险应用提供了具有统计保证的高效推理解决方案

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，需要评估这些模型是否会对不同社会群体产生偏见，以及这些偏见如何影响医疗建议的质量和公平性。

Method: 通过模拟不同性别、年龄和种族的患者档案，向LLMs提出一系列医学问题，比较生成回答的自然语言特征。

Result: LLMs生成的医疗建议在不同社会群体间存在系统性差异，原住民和双性人患者获得的建议可读性更差、更复杂，交叉群体的差异更为明显。

Conclusion: 需要提高AI素养，并呼吁AI开发者紧急调查和缓解这些系统性差异，确保患者支持的公平性。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型在需要透明度的监管领域中同时满足可解释性和高性能的需求，开发能够动态调整表示局部化程度的框架。

Method: 使用组稀疏惩罚、信息理论锚点设计和动态规则注入，通过可调节的局部化参数控制注意力的集中程度，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 提供了严格的数学证明，建立了明确的阈值条件，证明当组稀疏惩罚超过特定阈值时，注意力机制会集中在语义相关块上，实现低熵和高保真度。

Conclusion: 该框架使从业者能够在可解释和高性能模式之间连续插值，支持需要透明度和能力的监管领域应用。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in

small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the

modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于大语言模型（LLMs）的智能代理系统在放射学中的应用，重点分析了如何通过外部工具和反馈机制增强LLMs能力，实现从半自动化工作流到自适应代理的多种自主程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学具有多模态数据流和复杂工作流程的特点，适合引入能够适应上下文并自动化复杂任务的智能代理。虽然LLMs在放射学单个任务中已表现出色，但单独使用无法充分发挥其在多步骤工作流程中的潜力。

Method: 通过为LLMs配备外部工具和反馈机制，构建能够驱动系统的智能代理，这些系统展现出从半自动化工作流到自适应代理的不同自主程度。

Result: LLM驱动的智能代理系统在放射学中显示出应用潜力，能够处理复杂、多步骤的工作流程，其中决策依赖于来自多个信息源的动态上下文。

Conclusion: 本文综述了LLM驱动智能代理系统的设计、关键应用、评估方法，并指出了错误级联、工具使用效率和医疗IT集成等挑战。

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

*Jacopo Tagliabue,Ciro Greco*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在数据湖仓中如何通过API优先、可编程的方法实现安全的设计，使AI代理能够安全地操作生产数据，并通过概念验证展示了代理如何修复数据管道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据湖仓运行敏感工作负载，AI驱动的自动化引发了关于信任、正确性和治理的担忧。需要确保AI代理在操作生产数据时的安全性。

Method: 使用Bauplan作为案例研究，采用数据分支和声明性环境的方法，这些方法自然地扩展到代理，实现了可重现性和可观察性，同时减少了攻击面。提出了一个概念验证，其中代理使用受证明携带代码启发的正确性检查来修复数据管道。

Result: 原型演示表明，不受信任的AI代理可以安全地在生产数据上操作，并概述了实现完全代理化湖仓的路径。

Conclusion: API优先、可编程的湖仓为安全设计提供了正确的抽象，使代理化工作流程成为可能，同时确保数据操作的安全性和正确性。

Abstract: Data lakehouses run sensitive workloads, where AI-driven automation raises
concerns about trust, correctness, and governance. We argue that API-first,
programmable lakehouses provide the right abstractions for safe-by-design,
agentic workflows. Using Bauplan as a case study, we show how data branching
and declarative environments extend naturally to agents, enabling
reproducibility and observability while reducing the attack surface. We present
a proof-of-concept in which agents repair data pipelines using correctness
checks inspired by proof-carrying code. Our prototype demonstrates that
untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path
toward a fully agentic lakehouse.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphMERT是一个小型图形编码器模型，通过从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量知识图谱，解决了神经符号AI的可扩展性和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号AI领域近三十年来未能实现其潜力，主要因为现有框架难以扩展，且神经方法的隐式表示和近似推理限制了可解释性和可信度。知识图谱作为显式语义知识的黄金标准表示可以解决符号方面的问题，但从文本语料库自动推导可靠知识图谱仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 引入GraphMERT，一个微小的图形编码器模型，从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量知识图谱。GraphMERT与其等效知识图谱形成一个模块化神经符号堆栈：神经学习抽象；符号知识图谱用于可验证推理。

Result: 在PubMed糖尿病论文文本上，80M参数的GraphMERT生成的知识图谱达到69.8%的事实得分，而32B参数的基线LLM仅达到40.2%。GraphMERT知识图谱的有效性得分也更高，为68.8%，而LLM基线为43.0%。

Conclusion: GraphMERT + KG是第一个高效且可扩展的神经符号模型，在实现最先进基准精度的同时，相对于基线具有优越的符号表示能力。

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

TL;DR: LiveOIBench是一个包含403个奥林匹克级别编程竞赛题目的新基准测试，具有高质量测试用例和人类选手对比数据，评估显示GPT-5达到81.76百分位但仍落后于顶尖人类选手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前编程基准测试缺乏高难度问题、测试用例覆盖不足、依赖在线API导致可访问性差等问题。

Method: 从72个2023-2025年官方信息学奥林匹克竞赛中收集403个专家策划的题目，每个题目平均60个测试用例，集成精英选手表现数据，建立自包含评估系统。

Result: GPT-5达到81.76百分位，但落后于通常超过90百分位的顶尖人类选手；开源模型GPT-OSS-120B仅达60百分位，与前沿闭源模型存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 强大的推理模型应优先精确问题分析而非过度探索，未来模型应强调结构化分析并最小化不必要探索。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

TL;DR: 对Google Titans模型的轻量级重新实现和评估，发现该模型并不总是优于现有基线，但其神经记忆组件相比仅注意力模型能持续提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Google Titans模型缺乏公开代码且原始描述存在模糊性，阻碍了可复现性，因此需要重新实现并进行全面评估。

Method: 对Titans模型进行轻量级重新实现，并在掩码语言建模、时间序列预测和推荐任务上进行综合评估。

Result: Titans模型由于分块处理并不总是优于现有基线，但其神经记忆组件相比仅注意力模型能一致提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究证实了Titans模型的创新潜力，但也揭示了其实际局限性，为未来研究提出了问题。

Abstract: By the end of 2024, Google researchers introduced Titans: Learning at Test
Time, a neural memory model achieving strong empirical results across multiple
tasks. However, the lack of publicly available code and ambiguities in the
original description hinder reproducibility. In this work, we present a
lightweight reimplementation of Titans and conduct a comprehensive evaluation
on Masked Language Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and Recommendation tasks.
Our results reveal that Titans does not always outperform established baselines
due to chunking. However, its Neural Memory component consistently improves
performance compared to attention-only models. These findings confirm the
model's innovative potential while highlighting its practical limitations and
raising questions for future research.
