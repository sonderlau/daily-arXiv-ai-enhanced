The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined\nwith the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical\nterminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly\nchallenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be\neffectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in\nscenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this\nwork, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the\nadaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in\ndata-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images\nalongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation\nlearning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs\narchitectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we\nexplore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact\nmodel performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair\ncomparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,\naiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained\nmodels for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning\nthe VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with\nonly 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited\nsupervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained\nmedical image classification."}

Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an\nimportant role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low\ncost.

In this\npaper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular\nstructure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate\nexpert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent\nspecializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary\nroles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of\nstructure elucidation.

The enhanced voxel features\nproduced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or\nSSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,\nhighlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several\nbenchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based\nmodels.

However, existing methods still face significant challenges in\ngenerating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios\ninvolving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of\nfine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to\ncapture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional\nAttention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts\nlocalized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel\nregional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall\nvisually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in\nan image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted\nas region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided\nattention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly\nconsidered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions\nbetween unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,\nour approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image\ninformation, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional\nSISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nour approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic\nvisual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing\napproaches."}

Despite\npromising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high\ncomputational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their\ndeployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight\napproaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable\nconvolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,\nthese methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack\neffective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully\nleverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose\nGMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction\nand interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)\nmodules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature\nextraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further\nintegrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a\nparameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to\nenhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational\noverhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that\nGMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU\nand 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.\nAdditional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further\nconfirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its\npotential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect\ndetection.

We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach\ntailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR\nsensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor\nfusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar\nmodalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor\ndata through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement\non the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features\neffectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs\nmodalities based on distance and visibility.

In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an\nextension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,\nuncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder\nobtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a\nstate-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better\nunderstanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates\nadditional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via\nDensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more\ncomprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different\nheads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic\ninformation in 3D.

In this work, we investigate the\neffects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured\ndriving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity\nimproves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We\nattribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality\nand dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures\nwithin temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these\nobjectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive\nnature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant\nscene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic\nbehavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize\nsurface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this\nphenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay\nfrom diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial\naccuracy while maintaining strong visual quality."}
