### [1] [Detection of Temporal Variability in U.S. Climate Using Harmonic and Wavelet Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08627)
*Thomas Xiao*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 使用傅里叶和小波变换分析美国气候的周期性变化，发现年周期和2-7年ENSO周期是主要特征，谐波模型比线性趋势模型具有更好的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究美国气候的时间变异性，评估周期性成分在解释和预测气候观测变化中的解释力，比较谐波模型与线性回归趋势的表现。

Method: 使用傅里叶和小波变换对NOAA的nClimDiv数据集（1895-2024）中的月温度、降水和干旱指数数据进行谐波分解分析。

Result: 美国气候记录显示出以一年（季节性）和2-7年（与ENSO相关）为主的周期性，加入谐波项显著提高了大多数州和变量的模型性能。

Conclusion: 美国气候波动以准平稳振荡而非纯单调趋势为特征，频率感知模型比仅考虑趋势的方法具有更好的预测技能，应纳入季节展望、干旱监测和资源规划。

Abstract: This study investigates temporal variability in U.S. climate using harmonic decomposition techniques, specifically Fourier and wavelet transforms. Monthly temperature, precipitation, and drought index data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) U.S. Climate Divisional Dataset (nClimDiv, 1895--2024) were analyzed to detect periodic structures and their evolution over time. By comparing harmonic-based models with linear regression trends, this research evaluates the explanatory power of cyclic components in reproducing and predicting observed variability. Results show that U.S. climate records exhibit dominant periodicities near one year (seasonal) and 2--7 years (associated with the El Nino--Southern Oscillation, ENSO), and that incorporating harmonic terms significantly improves model performance across most states and variables. The findings indicate that U.S. climate fluctuations are characterized by quasi-stationary oscillations rather than purely monotonic trends. Overall, the main implication is that frequency-aware models provide measurably better predictive skill than trend-only approaches and should be incorporated into seasonal outlooks, drought monitoring, and resource planning.

### [2] [Resolving Thermospheric Vertical Wind Ambiguities and Energy Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08830)
*Jeffrey P. Thayer,Austin Coleman*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 本研究通过广义垂直坐标系和热力学控制体积分析，揭示了热层垂直运动能量传递过程的微妙差异，特别强调了高度坐标和压力坐标下垂直风分量的不同能量贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索热层垂直运动能量传递过程的细微解释差异，澄清高度坐标和压力坐标下垂直风分量对内部能量评估的不同贡献。

Method: 使用TIEGCM V3.0模型模拟，结合热力学控制体积分析，比较高度坐标和压力坐标下垂直风分量的能量贡献差异。

Result: 发现高度坐标下的垂直风变换到等压面时包含显著的抬升分量，且只有部分高度坐标下的垂直风贡献于绝热加热/冷却率。气辉观测推断的垂直风与压力/高度坐标定义的风存在不对齐。

Conclusion: 准确评估观测垂直风对内部能量的影响需要明确区分高度和压力面，气辉观测中的垂直风差异源于发射结构相对于压力/高度面的关系不明确。

Abstract: This study applies a generalized vertical coordinate system approach alongside thermodynamic control volume analysis to explore the nuanced interpretations of energy transfer processes associated with vertical motion in the thermosphere. Using simulations from the TIEGCM V3.0 model, a key finding reveals that transforming vertical winds in height coordinates onto constant pressure surfaces contain a substantial lifting component; an aspect often overlooked in previous research. This distinction is critical for internal energy assessments, as vertical winds defined in pressure coordinates directly contribute to the adiabatic heating or cooling rates while only a portion of the vertical wind in height coordinates contributes to these energy changes. These differences are demonstrated through schematic representations of thermodynamic control volumes that model a column of thermospheric gas undergoing various energy transfer processes. Accurately determining the portion of observed vertical winds that affect internal energy requires clear understanding between height and pressure surfaces; a nontrivial challenge in observational contexts. Furthermore, applying the generalized vertical coordinate framework to airglow emissions in the upper thermosphere uncovers an inherent ambiguity: vertical winds inferred from airglow observations may not align with those defined on pressure or altitude surfaces. This insight suggests that discrepancies in the behavior and magnitude of vertical winds derived from FPI observations of red-line emissions in the upper thermosphere are due to poorly known relations between the emission structure relative to pressure or height surfaces.

*Daoming Zhu,Xinghong Cheng,Yanbo Shen,Chunsong Lu,Duanyang Liu,Shuqi Yan,Naifu Shao,Zhongfeng Xu,Jida Peng,Bing Chen*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 使用WRF-Chem模型模拟中国2015-2060年高分辨率太阳辐射，评估光伏发电潜力，为双碳目标提供科学依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为支持中国在全球变暖情景下的双碳目标，需要高时空分辨率、准确的中长期预测数据。

Method: 使用WRF-Chem模型，基于偏差校正的CMIP数据集和未来排放清单，模拟中国2015-2060年每小时10km分辨率的太阳辐射，并改进评估模型计算月度光伏发电潜力。

Result: WRF-Chem模型能准确再现太阳辐射时空演变；中国GHI呈现明显西高东低梯度；主要光伏基地GHI年际波动小，主要受总云量主导；全国光伏发电量从2015年68.7TWh增长到2060年129.7TWh，翻了一番。

Conclusion: 该数据集为中国双碳战略下的可再生能源规划和电网安全提供了重要科学依据。

Abstract: A high spatiotemporal resolution and accurate middle-to-long-term prediction data is essential to support China's dual-carbon targets under global warming scenarios. In this study, we simulated hourly solar radiation at a 10 km* 10 km resolution in January, April, July, and October at five-year intervals from 2015 to 2060 across China using the WRF-Chem model driven by bias-corrected CMIP datasets and future emission inventories. We further calculated the monthly photovoltaic power potentials based on an improved assessment model. Results indicate that the WRF-Chem model can reproduce the spatiotemporal evolution of solar radiation with small simulation errors. GHI in 2030 and 2060 over China are characterized by a pronounced west-to-east gradient. The interannual fluctuations of GHI from 2015 to 2060 over China's major PV power generation bases are small, and the interannual variability of GHI is mainly dominated by TCC and the influence of AOD is limited. National averaged PV power generation in China shows a significant growth trend and increases from 68.7 TWh in 2015 to 129.7 TWh in 2060, which is approximately twice the 2015 value. The dataset will provide an important scientific basis for renewable energy planning and grid security under China's dual-carbon strategy.

### [4] [Stabilizing Direct Training of Spiking Neural Networks: Membrane Potential Initialization and Threshold-robust Surrogate Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08708)
*Hyunho Kook,Byeongho Yu,Jeong Min Oh,Eunhyeok Park*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出MP-Init和TrSG两种创新方法，解决SNN训练中的时间协变量偏移和梯度不稳定问题，在静态和动态图像数据集上实现最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN直接训练在早期时间步已能产生高质量输出，但非线性特性和时间依赖性导致时间协变量偏移和可学习神经元阈值带来的梯度不稳定问题。

Method: MP-Init通过将初始膜电位与其稳态分布对齐来解决TCS；TrSG在训练期间稳定阈值电压的梯度流。

Result: 在静态和动态图像数据集上达到最先进的准确率。

Conclusion: MP-Init和TrSG有效解决了SNN训练中的关键挑战，为高效能AI范式开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in the direct training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated high-quality outputs even at early timesteps, paving the way for novel energy-efficient AI paradigms. However, the inherent non-linearity and temporal dependencies in SNNs introduce persistent challenges, such as temporal covariate shift (TCS) and unstable gradient flow with learnable neuron thresholds. In this paper, we present two key innovations: MP-Init (Membrane Potential Initialization) and TrSG (Threshold-robust Surrogate Gradient). MP-Init addresses TCS by aligning the initial membrane potential with its stationary distribution, while TrSG stabilizes gradient flow with respect to threshold voltage during training. Extensive experiments validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on both static and dynamic image datasets. The code is available at: https://github.com/kookhh0827/SNN-MP-Init-TRSG

TL;DR: 本文开发了基于生成式AI的解决方案，用于自动化SNAM能源基础设施的工厂结构获取，通过OCR、视觉LLM、目标检测等技术从P&ID图纸中提取设计数据和层次结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能源转型需要数字化和创新技术，本文旨在设计基于AI的解决方案来自动化工厂数字化过程，简化MGM用户的日常工作

Method: 使用OCR、Vision LLM、目标检测、关系推理和优化算法，并扩展了最先进的场景图生成模型，引入新的Transformer架构来分析工厂组件间的复杂关系

Result: 文本信息提取准确率达91%，93%的组件被正确识别，层次结构提取准确率约80%

Conclusion: 协同使用多种AI技术成功克服了数据多样性带来的挑战，实现了有效的工厂数字化自动化解决方案

Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

### [6] [Token Is All You Need: Cognitive Planning through Belief-Intent Co-Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05540)
*Shiyao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 挑战传统自动驾驶需要详尽场景建模的假设，提出基于信念-意图协同进化的认知规划方法，在稀疏语义token上实现高性能端到端自动驾驶


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知科学启发，认为有效规划源于信念与意图在语义丰富token中的协同进化，而非详尽的世界重建

Method: 使用稀疏意图token进行规划，将轨迹解码条件化于预测的未来token，避免显式重建损失，实现信念-意图协同进化

Result: 在nuPlan基准测试中：仅稀疏意图token达到0.487m ADE；条件化轨迹解码将ADE降至0.382m（提升21.6%）；显式重建损失会降低性能

Conclusion: 智能不在于像素保真度，而在于信念与意图的token化二元性，将规划重新定义为理解而非反应，为具有前瞻性的智能体铺平道路

Abstract: We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Inspired by cognitive science, we propose that effective planning arises not from reconstructing the world, but from the co-evolution of belief and intent within a minimal set of semantically rich tokens. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, 11k+ samples) reveal three principles: (1) sparse intent tokens alone achieve 0.487 m ADE, demonstrating strong performance without future prediction; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.382 m, a 21.6% improvement, showing that performance emerges from cognitive planning; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss degrades performance, confirming that task-driven belief-intent co-evolution suffices under reliable perception inputs. Crucially, we observe the emergence of cognitive consistency: through prolonged training, the model spontaneously develops stable token dynamics that balance current perception (belief) and future goals (intent). This process, accompanied by "temporal fuzziness," enables robustness under uncertainty and continuous self-optimization. Our work establishes a new paradigm: intelligence lies not in pixel fidelity, but in the tokenized duality of belief and intent. By reframing planning as understanding rather than reaction, TIWM bridges the gap between world models and VLA systems, paving the way for foresightful agents that plan through imagination. Note: Numerical comparisons with methods reporting results on nuScenes are indicative only, as nuPlan presents a more challenging planning-focused evaluation.

### [7] [Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613)
*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出系统评估方法分析唇部泄漏问题，包括三种测试设置和衍生指标，为说话人脸生成建立更可靠基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于修复的说话人脸生成方法存在唇部泄漏问题，即生成的唇形受到参考图像影响而非仅由音频驱动，但传统指标难以检测此问题。

Method: 使用三种互补测试设置：静音输入生成、不匹配音视频配对、匹配音视频合成，并引入唇同步差异和静音音频唇同步分数等衍生指标。

Result: 建立了模型无关的评估框架，能够量化分析唇部泄漏问题，为参考图像设计提供见解。

Conclusion: 提出的系统评估方法为说话人脸生成研究建立了更可靠的基准，有助于未来研究的准确评估。

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MATRIX数据集和深度学习框架，解决多无人机动态监控中的行人检测与跟踪挑战，在复杂遮挡环境下保持约90%的检测跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理动态相机位置和复杂遮挡，多无人机监控系统需要更先进的技术来应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出MATRIX数据集（8个无人机同步视频）和深度学习框架，包含实时相机标定、基于特征的图像配准、鸟瞰图多视图特征融合。

Result: 在复杂环境下保持约90%检测跟踪精度，成功跟踪约80%轨迹，迁移学习表现优异，相机失效时性能优雅下降。

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和框架为动态多视图监控系统提供了重要基准，展示了在实际部署中的实用鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Grassmann流形的拓扑驱动多子空间融合框架，通过自适应子空间协作和Fréchet均值优化，在3D动作识别、EEG分类和图任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖静态单子空间表示，忽略了多子空间之间的动态交互对捕捉复杂几何结构的关键作用。

Method: 1) 基于Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理的自适应多子空间建模机制，通过拓扑收敛分析动态选择和加权任务相关子空间；2) 多子空间交互块，通过流形上的Fréchet均值优化融合异构几何表示。

Result: 在HDM05、FPHA等3D动作识别数据集、MAMEM-SSVEPII EEG分类和图任务上展示了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了几何深度学习，还将欧几里得网络中已验证的多通道交互原理成功适应到非欧几里得领域，实现了优越的判别性和可解释性。

Abstract: Grassmannian manifold offers a powerful carrier for geometric representation learning by modelling high-dimensional data as low-dimensional subspaces. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图像和文本的视频生成方法无法提供精确的运动控制，而需要模型特定微调的方法计算成本高且限制性强。

Method: 使用用户友好的操作（如剪切拖拽或深度重投影）获取粗参考动画作为运动线索，采用双时钟去噪策略在指定运动区域强制对齐，同时在其他区域保持灵活性。

Conclusion: TTM提供了一种轻量级的采样过程修改，无需额外训练成本，兼容任何骨干网络，并引入了通过像素级条件实现的精确外观控制能力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的持续异常检测框架，使用统一内存库而非任务特定的子内存库，通过核心集增量更新嵌入，在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于嵌入的持续异常检测方法需要为每个任务构建特定类别子内存库的限制，提高方法的灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 所有任务共享统一内存库，在固定大小的核心集中增量更新嵌入，通过最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。

Conclusion: 该方法在持续异常检测中表现出优越性能，验证了在实际场景中的鲁棒性，代码将在GitHub开源。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出统一框架，结合扩散去噪和时间感知的actor-critic模型，解决事故预测中的传感器噪声和及时可靠预警问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事故预测对主动安全驾驶至关重要，但面临传感器噪声和及时可靠预警的挑战

Method: 使用扩散模块重建抗噪声的图像和物体特征，结合actor-critic架构进行长时间推理和时间加权奖励

Result: 在三个基准数据集上达到最先进精度，显著提高平均事故时间，在噪声条件下保持鲁棒性能

Conclusion: 模型能产生更早、更稳定且与人类对齐的预测，具有实际部署潜力

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

### [13] [RS-Net: Context-Aware Relation Scoring for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08651)
*Hae-Won Jo,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net)，一个模块化框架，通过空间交互和长程时间上下文来评估对象对的上下文重要性，提升动态场景图生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态场景图生成方法仅在有标注的对象对上训练，缺乏对非相关对象对的指导，导致在推理时难以识别有意义的对象关系。

Method: RS-Net包含空间上下文编码器（带可学习上下文标记）和时间编码器（聚合视频级信息），通过关系评分机制增强关系预测，可无缝集成到现有DSGG模型中。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上的实验表明，RS-Net在多种基线模型上一致提升了召回率和精确率，在平均召回率上有显著提升，有效解决了关系的长尾分布问题。

Conclusion: RS-Net在保持竞争性效率的同时，实现了优于最先进方法的性能，为动态场景图生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在潜在空间中保护视频基础模型视觉隐私的新方法，通过轻量级匿名适配模块从视频特征中移除私人信息，同时保持通用任务效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型提取的时空特征在增强视频内容理解的同时，无意中泄露了敏感个人信息（如肤色、性别、服装等）。现有隐私保护方法需要重新训练整个模型，不适合视频基础模型。

Method: 引入轻量级匿名适配模块（AAM），采用三种新设计的训练目标：片段级自监督隐私目标、协同训练目标和潜在一致性损失，可在冻结的视频编码器上即插即用。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频基础模型提供了一种高效且通用的隐私保护解决方案，在不牺牲任务性能的前提下有效保护敏感信息。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了自回归逐像素预测的扩展特性，发现在固定32x32分辨率下，图像分类和图像生成的最优扩展策略存在分歧，生成任务需要数据量以3-5倍更快的速度增长。随着分辨率提高，模型规模需要比数据量增长更快，计算能力是主要瓶颈而非训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归逐像素预测这一简单但未被充分研究的统一视觉模型框架的扩展特性，了解不同视觉任务（分类和生成）在扩展过程中的最优策略差异。

Method: 使用IsoFlops配置文件训练一系列Transformer模型，计算预算高达7e19 FLOPs，在32x32分辨率下评估三个目标指标：逐像素预测目标、ImageNet分类准确率和Fréchet距离衡量的生成质量。

Result: 1) 在固定32x32分辨率下，图像分类和图像生成的最优扩展策略不同，生成任务需要数据量以3-5倍更快的速度增长；2) 分辨率提高时，模型规模需要比数据量增长更快；3) 主要瓶颈是计算能力而非训练数据量。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现预测，随着计算能力每年增长4-5倍，未来五年内实现逐像素图像建模是可行的，计算能力是限制因素而非数据量。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用扩散模型微调技术（如LoRA和DreamBooth）来生成平衡的训练数据，以解决图像分类中的群体偏见问题。通过聚类和多个DreamBooth模型的方法，能够更准确地表示每个训练群体，并在多个基准测试中取得了优于原始Stable Diffusion和可与最先进去偏技术相媲美的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类系统常因训练数据中群体代表性不均而继承偏见，例如人脸数据集中金发与女性的过度关联会强化刻板印象。现有方法使用Stable Diffusion生成平衡数据，但难以保持原始数据分布。

Method: 探索多种扩散模型微调技术（LoRA和DreamBooth），在每个群体内对图像进行聚类并为每个聚类训练一个DreamBooth模型，以防止单个模型被过多的组内变化所淹没。使用这些模型生成群体平衡数据进行预训练，然后在真实数据上进行微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，所研究的微调方法平均优于原始Stable Diffusion，且与最先进的去偏技术（如Group-DRO）结果相当，随着数据集偏见严重程度的增加，表现甚至超过这些技术。

Conclusion: 扩散模型微调技术能够有效生成平衡的训练数据，缓解图像分类中的群体偏见问题，特别是在偏见严重的数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

*Abu Taib Mohammed Shahjahan,A. Ben Hamza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PoseKAN框架，将KAN扩展到基于图的学习中，用于从单张图像进行2D到3D姿态提升。相比传统GCN，PoseKAN使用可学习函数增强模型适应性和表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GCN方法在3D人体姿态估计中存在局部感受野限制，难以捕捉长距离依赖关系来处理遮挡和深度模糊问题，且存在频谱偏差，优先处理低频分量而难以建模高频细节。

Method: PoseKAN采用自适应图KAN框架，在图边上使用可学习函数实现数据驱动的自适应特征变换。包含多跳特征聚合、残差PoseKAN块和全局响应归一化。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型在性能上与最先进方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: PoseKAN通过可学习的边函数和多跳特征聚合，有效提升了3D人体姿态估计的性能，特别是在处理复杂姿态变化和空间感知方面表现出色。

Abstract: Graph convolutional network (GCN)-based methods have shown strong performance in 3D human pose estimation by leveraging the natural graph structure of the human skeleton. However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 初步结果表明，该方法能有效提升视觉模型对基于梯度的白盒对抗攻击的鲁棒性，且仅导致清洁准确率轻微下降。

Conclusion: SIFT-Graph框架通过结构特征聚合成功增强了传统视觉模型的对抗鲁棒性，为防御对抗攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks expose a fundamental vulnerability in modern deep vision models by exploiting their dependence on dense, pixel-level representations that are highly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations. Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy.

Conclusion: DT-NVS在真实世界未对齐数据集上成功训练，能够从单张图像生成多样化的自然场景新视角，突破了现有方法的限制。

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

TL;DR: 提出Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF)和Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv)来解决3D点云旋转不变学习中的全局姿态信息丢失问题，通过引入'影子'参考点来增强局部特征的空间区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的旋转不变学习方法使用手工设计的RI特征替代原始坐标，虽然保证了旋转不变性，但丢失了全局姿态信息，无法区分几何相似但空间位置不同的结构（如飞机的左右机翼）。

Method: 1. 提出SiPF特征，通过学习的共享旋转生成全局一致的参考点（影子）来增强局部RI描述符；2. 设计RIAttnConv注意力卷积算子，将SiPF集成到特征聚合过程中；3. 基于Bingham分布的任务自适应影子定位模块，动态学习最优全局旋转。

Conclusion: 通过引入全局一致的参考点和注意力机制，该方法在保持旋转不变性的同时有效解决了对称结构区分问题，提升了3D点云分析的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

TL;DR: 提出了SAS-SSM模型，通过结构感知的时空卷积和基于步长的扫描策略，在保持线性计算复杂度的同时有效建模3D人体姿态的局部和全局依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于状态空间模型的3D人体姿态估计方法通常使用手动设计的扫描操作将2D姿态序列展平为纯时间序列，这会破坏人体姿态的固有空间结构并纠缠时空特征，难以捕捉复杂的姿态依赖关系。

Method: 提出Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM)，首先使用结构感知的时空卷积动态捕捉关节间的局部交互，然后应用基于步长的扫描策略构建多尺度全局结构表示。

Result: 基于SAS-SSM的SasMamba模型在3D姿态估计中取得了有竞争力的性能，且参数数量显著少于现有的混合模型。

Conclusion: SAS-SSM能够灵活建模局部和全局姿态信息，同时保持线性计算复杂度，为3D人体姿态估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, the Mamba architecture based on State Space Models (SSMs) has gained attention in 3D human pose estimation due to its linear complexity and strong global modeling capability. However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

Result: 在七个公共数据集上的实验表明，MFAVBs作为对比聚类骨干网络在聚类性能上优于最先进技术。

Conclusion: 提出的MFAVBs方法通过显式特征融合和增强，有效提升了对比学习在图像聚类中的性能。

Abstract: In the field of image clustering, the widely used contrastive learning networks improve clustering performance by maximizing the similarity between positive pairs and the dissimilarity of negative pairs of the inputs. Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model. Our experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that MFAVBs serving as the backbone for contrastive clustering outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of clustering performance.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

Abstract: Object recognition plays a fundamental role in how biological organisms perceive and interact with their environment. While the human visual system performs this task with remarkable efficiency, reproducing similar capabilities in artificial systems remains challenging. This study investigates VisNet, a biologically inspired neural network model, and several enhanced variants incorporating radial basis function neurons, Mahalanobis distance based learning, and retinal like preprocessing for both general object recognition and symmetry classification. By leveraging principles of Hebbian learning and temporal continuity associating temporally adjacent views to build invariant representations. VisNet and its extensions capture robust and transformation invariant features. Experimental results across multiple datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and custom symmetric object sets, show that these enhanced VisNet variants substantially improve recognition accuracy compared with the baseline model. These findings underscore the adaptability and biological relevance of VisNet inspired architectures, offering a powerful and interpretable framework for visual recognition in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

Result: 在6种不同模型架构和多个数据集上，与7种现有方法相比，该框架实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SemBridge框架有效解决了弱语义一致性下的跨模态知识传输问题，在遥感场景分类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

Abstract: Unsupervised remote sensing change detection aims to monitor and analyze changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images in the same geometric region at different times, without the need for labeled training data. Previous unsupervised methods attempt to achieve style transfer across multi-temporal remote sensing images through reconstruction by a generator network, and then capture the unreconstructable areas as the changed regions. However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a Cycle Consistency (CC) module to reduce the overfitting issues in the generator-based reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a Semantic Consistency (SC) module to enable detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN目标检测的形状依赖性缺陷，特别是在训练数据中未包含的姿势下性能下降的问题。

Method: 利用服装的光谱反射特性，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现形状无关的人员检测。

Result: 处理速度达到23.2 fps，在模拟搜救场景中平均精度达93.5%，远超CNN模型的最佳精度53.8%，且误报率极低。

Conclusion: HitoMi-Cam不是要替代CNN检测器，而是在特定条件下作为补充工具，在形状不可预测的真实环境中具有实用价值。

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

Motivation: 解决纯文本训练在零样本图像描述中的跨域泛化问题，避免检索方法可能加剧幻觉的局限性

Conclusion: NES方法有效解决了零样本图像描述中的幻觉问题，通过负实体抑制机制显著提升了跨域泛化性能

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/antgroup/SPEED-Q.

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

Conclusion: 这是首次探索集成非注意力在提升跨架构可迁移性方面的能力，为发起集成攻击提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Ensemble attacks integrate the outputs of surrogate models with diverse architectures, which can be combined with various gradient-based attacks to improve adversarial transferability. However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks.

Conclusion: 通过更高效的运动和上下文处理，BRHVC能够有效协调双向参考帧，为神经B帧视频压缩提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Conclusion: 这是首次将HD引入FGM的工作，有效提升了生成输出的多样性，并为FGM发展提供了理论贡献。

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

Conclusion: AuthSig成功地将认证信息绑定到签名图像中，为静态电子签名提供了可靠的安全保障，解决了传统静态签名易被复制和重用的安全问题。

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

TL;DR: T-Rex-Omni是一个开放集目标检测框架，通过引入负视觉提示来抑制视觉相似但语义不同的干扰物，解决了现有方法仅依赖正提示的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开放集目标检测器仅依赖基于文本描述或视觉示例的正提示，在面对视觉相似但语义不同的干扰物时存在脆弱性。

Method: 提出统一视觉提示编码器处理正负提示，训练免费的否定负计算模块动态抑制负响应，以及否定负铰链损失增强正负嵌入的区分度。

Result: 在零样本检测中表现出色，显著缩小了视觉提示与文本提示方法的性能差距，在长尾场景中表现尤为突出（LVIS-minival上51.2 AP_r）。

Conclusion: 负提示成为推进开放集视觉识别系统的关键新维度。

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

TL;DR: Owl是一个基于因果推理的双模态注意力重加权框架，通过建模视觉和文本注意力的交互来缓解大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法独立调节视觉或文本注意力，忽视了它们作为两个关键因果因素的交互作用，无法有效解决物体幻觉问题。

Method: 提出VTACR指标量化模态贡献不平衡，设计细粒度注意力干预机制动态调整token和layer级注意力，并采用双路径对比解码策略。

Result: 在POPE和CHAIR基准测试中，Owl显著减少了幻觉，在保持视觉语言理解能力的同时实现了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: Owl通过建模视觉-文本注意力交互和对比解码策略，有效缓解了物体幻觉问题，为LVLMs的可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

It takes into account the correlations between cross-scale features to decrease the alignment difficulty. Our model supports flexible trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency by adjusting the number of scales utilized. Additionally, we introduce a fully spatial correlation module to further improve accuracy while maintaining low computational costs. We incorporate the just noticeable difference to encourage our model to focus on image regions more sensitive to distortions, eliminating noticeable alignment errors. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: USF-Net是一个统一的时空融合网络，用于地面遥感云图像序列外推，通过自适应大核卷积和低复杂度注意力机制解决现有方法的局限性，在预测精度和计算效率之间实现优越平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有云图像序列外推方法存在三个主要问题：(1)依赖静态核增强特征信息，缺乏动态提取多分辨率特征的自适应机制；(2)时间引导不足，导致长程时空依赖建模不理想；(3)注意力机制的二次计算成本被忽视，限制了实际部署效率。

Method: 提出USF-Net网络，集成自适应大核卷积和低复杂度注意力机制，在编码器-解码器框架中结合时间流信息。编码器使用三个基础层提取特征，USTM模块包含SiB（配备SSM动态捕获多尺度上下文信息）和TiB（配备TAM高效建模长程时间依赖）。引入DSM和TGM统一建模时间引导的时空依赖。解码器使用DUM解决"重影效应"，利用初始时间状态作为注意力算子保留关键运动特征。

Conclusion: USF-Net通过创新的自适应大核卷积和低复杂度注意力机制，有效解决了现有云图像序列外推方法的局限性，为光伏发电系统开发提供了更高效的解决方案，并发布了ASI-CIS数据集促进相关研究。

Abstract: Ground-based remote sensing cloud image sequence extrapolation is a key research area in the development of photovoltaic power systems. However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common "ghosting effect." It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures. As a key contribution, we also introduce and release the ASI-CIS dataset. Extensive experiments on ASI-CIS demonstrate that USF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a superior balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for ground-based cloud extrapolation. The dataset and source code will be available at https://github.com/she1110/ASI-CIS.

Abstract: Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image dehazing faces challenges such as limited scene adaptability in prior-based methods and high computational complexity with color distortion in deep learning approaches. To address these issues, we propose 4KDehazeFlow, a novel method based on Flow Matching and the Haze-Aware vector field. This method models the dehazing process as a progressive optimization of continuous vector field flow, providing efficient data-driven adaptive nonlinear color transformation for high-quality dehazing. Specifically, our method has the following advantages: 1) 4KDehazeFlow is a general method compatible with various deep learning networks, without relying on any specific network architecture. 2) We propose a learnable 3D lookup table (LUT) that encodes haze transformation parameters into a compact 3D mapping matrix, enabling efficient inference through precomputed mappings. 3) We utilize a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver to stably solve the dehazing flow field through an accurate step-by-step iterative method, effectively suppressing artifacts. Extensive experiments show that 4KDehazeFlow exceeds seven state-of-the-art methods. It delivers a 2dB PSNR increase and better performance in dense haze and color fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏因果控制、交互性和长视野一致性，而现有世界模型往往局限于特定领域且泛化能力有限。需要开发一个能跨领域泛化、支持自然语言动作控制的世界模型。

Method: 采用生成潜在预测(GLP)架构，结合基于大语言模型的自回归潜在动态骨干网络（支持语言动作条件）和视频扩散解码器（重建视觉观察），在多样化视频-动作对数据上训练。

Result: 在动作条件世界模拟、长视野预测和模拟推理方面表现优异，相比其他视频生成器和世界模型具有更强性能。

Conclusion: PAN向通用世界模型迈进一步，能够为推理和行动提供未来世界状态的预测模拟。

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

Conclusion: VietMEAgent框架支持教育和文化保护，强调可解释性和文化敏感性，为文化AI提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Contemporary Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems remain constrained when confronted with culturally specific content, largely because cultural knowledge is under-represented in training corpora and the reasoning process is not rendered interpretable to end users. This paper introduces VietMEAgent, a multimodal explainable framework engineered for Vietnamese cultural understanding. The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled. A curated knowledge base of Vietnamese cultural entities serves as an explicit source of background information, while a dual-modality explanation module combines attention-based visual evidence with structured, human-readable textual rationales. We further construct a Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset sourced from public repositories and use it to demonstrate the practicality of programming-based methodologies for cultural AI. The resulting system provides transparent explanations that disclose both the computational rationale and the underlying cultural context, supporting education and cultural preservation with an emphasis on interpretability and cultural sensitivity.

Method: 提出方向正交对抗攻击(DOC)，结合正交梯度方向和动量更新来扩展对抗攻击空间探索，增加扰动多样性，同时基于平均余弦相似度提出方向敏感度评分来提升样本区分度和自适应调节对抗攻击强度

Result: 在16个数据集上的广泛实验表明，DOC在各种攻击下提高了对抗鲁棒性，同时保持了竞争力的干净准确率

Conclusion: 增强对抗攻击的多样性和覆盖范围对于提高测试时防御的对抗鲁棒性至关重要，DOC方法通过正交梯度方向和动量更新有效实现了这一目标

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Conclusion: CompIL框架能够有效支持组合增量学习，逐步提升模型的组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: UL-TTA是一种无需训练和反向传播的轻量级测试时适应方法，通过在线EM过程调整logit级参数（类别原型、先验和温度），在领域偏移下显著提升CLIP等视觉语言模型的准确性和校准性。

Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法需要反向传播、协方差估计或大量内存，不适用于流式和边缘场景。VLMs在领域偏移下存在特征漂移、类别先验不匹配和严重校准不足问题。

Method: 冻结主干网络，仅在线调整logit级参数：使用选择性样本过滤、贝叶斯更新原型和先验、解耦预测与校准温度、轻量防护机制防止长期漂移。

Result: 在多个大规模跨域和OOD基准测试中，相比零样本CLIP平均提升4.7%的top-1准确率，ECE降低20-30%，延迟开销小于8%，在20万样本的长流实验中无崩溃。

Conclusion: logit级贝叶斯适应足以在领域偏移下为VLMs获得最先进的准确率-校准权衡，无需更新任何主干参数。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition by comparing image embeddings to text-derived class prototypes. However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse. Our results demonstrate that logit-level Bayesian adaptation is sufficient to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy-calibration trade-offs for VLMs under domain shift, without updating any backbone parameters.

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Abstract: Flood mapping is crucial for assessing and mitigating flood impacts, yet traditional methods like numerical modeling and aerial photography face limitations in efficiency and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose PIFF, a physics-informed, flow-based generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation. Built on an image-to-image generative framework, it efficiently maps Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to flood depth predictions. The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps. Using a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios ranging from 24 mm to 720 mm over 24 hours, our results demonstrate that PIFF offers an effective, data-driven alternative for flood prediction and response.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Abstract: Hundreds of benchmarks dedicated to evaluating large models from multiple perspectives have been presented over the past few years. Albeit substantial efforts, most of them remain closed-ended and are prone to overfitting due to the potential data contamination in the ever-growing training corpus of large models, thereby undermining the credibility of the evaluation. Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies. We hope that MACEval can broaden future directions of large model evaluation.

Motivation: 解决支气管镜术中定位的挑战，包括呼吸运动、解剖变异和CT与身体差异导致的变形和对齐问题，现有方法难以跨域泛化。

Method: 使用模态和域不变编码器计算内窥镜RGB帧与CT渲染深度图的相似度，通过可微分渲染模块迭代优化相机位姿，仅使用合成数据进行训练。

Result: 在合成基准数据集上达到平均平移误差2.65mm和旋转误差0.19rad，在真实患者数据上表现出强跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过迭代视觉优化实现了鲁棒的域不变定位，新基准数据集为支气管镜导航的标准化进展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖几何线索并独立预测每个3D姿态，无法有效解决模糊运动和在真实场景中的泛化问题。受人类理解和预测运动方式的启发，需要结合动作感知和时间连贯性。

Method: 1) 使用从2D姿态序列提取的任务相关动作提示动态调节去噪过程；2) 引入表示编码器，在注意力机制中融入运动学关节亲和度；3) 使用幻觉姿态解码器在训练期间预测时间连贯的3D姿态序列。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-3DHP基准数据集上所有指标均达到最先进性能。在广播棒球数据集上，即使面对模糊和噪声的2D输入，也能保持强健性能，有效处理时间一致性和意图驱动的运动变化。

Conclusion: DreamPose3D通过结合动作感知推理和时间想象，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在处理模糊运动和真实场景方面表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型反演的潜在空间动态分析为AI生成视频检测提供了有效方法，能够在单生成器训练下实现跨生成器的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型越来越多地用于直接从图像生成皮肤病诊断叙述，但可靠的评估仍然是临床负责任部署的主要瓶颈。

Method: 构建DermBench基准（包含4000个真实皮肤病图像和专家认证的诊断叙述），并使用基于LLM的评判器对候选叙述进行评分；训练DermEval评估器（无需参考的多模态评估器），根据图像和生成叙述产生结构化批评和评分。

Conclusion: DermBench和DermEval提供了可靠的诊断能力和可信度测量，能够对不同多模态LLM进行一致和全面的评估。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型经常出现对象存在、属性或关系方面的幻觉错误，这削弱了其可靠性，需要一种简单有效的方法来缓解这些问题。

Method: TACO将回答分解为原子查询，通过改写来减少对措辞的敏感性，使用自一致性（黑盒）或自置信度（灰盒）聚合来估计置信度，最后用语言模型精炼答案。

Result: 在五个基准测试（POPE、MME、HallusionBench、AMBER和MM-Hal Bench）上，使用两个MLLM（LLaVA-1.5-7B和CogVLM2）的实验表明，TACO始终优于直接提示和视觉对比解码，减少了系统偏差，并改善了置信度校准。

Conclusion: TACO框架有效增强了多模态大语言模型的忠实度，通过自验证和置信度校准显著减少了幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

Motivation: 深度神经网络通常学习空间纠缠的表征，将判别性前景特征与虚假背景相关性混在一起，这削弱了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 从信息论角度证明VJP构成输入特征关于类别标签的最小充分统计量，提出编码-解码视角：前向传播将输入编码到类别空间，反向传播中的VJP将此编码解码回特征空间。通过最大化前景VJP与输入的互信息，同时最小化背景区域的互信息，实现空间信息流解耦。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在六种解释方法上均实现了普遍改进，获得了更好的前景集中和背景抑制效果，且无需方法特定调优，同时分类准确率也有稳定提升。

Conclusion: S-IB框架通过直接优化训练过程中VJP的空间结构，能够有效提升各种解释范式的可视化质量，实现特征空间解耦，增强模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically learn spatially entangled representations that conflate discriminative foreground features with spurious background correlations, thereby undermining model interpretability and robustness. We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.

Abstract: The Animation-based Generative Codec (AGC) is an emerging paradigm for talking-face video compression. However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design. The hardware processing unit comprises engines such as convolution, grid sampling, upsample, etc. Parallelization optimization strategies like double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling are employed to fully exploit the resources of FPGA. Ultimately, we establish an AGC FPGA prototype on the PYNQ-Z1 platform using the proposed scheme, achieving \textbf{24.9$\times$} and \textbf{4.1$\times$} higher energy efficiency against commercial Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), respectively. Specifically, only \textbf{11.7} microjoules ($\upmu$J) are required for one pixel reconstructed by this FPGA system.

Abstract: Energy expenditure estimation aims to infer human metabolic rate from physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or accelerometer data, and has been studied primarily with classical regression methods. The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors. Finally, subject-level analysis highlights strong inter-individual variability, motivating the need for adaptive modeling strategies. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/Sarvibabakhani/deeplearning-biosignals-ee .

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

*Jiangyong Yu,Changyong Shu,Sifan Zhou,Zichen Yu,Xing Hu,Yan Chen,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FQ-PETR是一个针对PETR系列3D检测模型的完全量化框架，通过量化友好的位置嵌入、双查找表和非线性算子优化，在W8A8量化下实现接近浮点精度（仅1%性能下降）和75%延迟降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PETR系列模型在3D检测基准上表现出色，但存在高计算成本和内存占用问题，直接应用现有量化方法会导致严重精度下降，主要由于多模态特征间的幅度差异和非线性算子量化困难。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1) QFPE位置嵌入，用LiDAR先验引导的单点采样替代多点采样；2) DULUT双查找表，用两个级联线性查找表近似复杂非线性函数；3) QANS量化后数值稳定化，在softmax数值稳定化后执行量化。

Result: 在PETR、StreamPETR、PETRv2、MV2d等模型上，FQ-PETR在W8A8量化下达到接近浮点精度（仅1%性能下降），同时减少延迟高达75%，显著优于现有PTQ和QAT基线方法。

Conclusion: FQ-PETR成功解决了PETR系列模型量化中的关键挑战，实现了高效且准确的量化部署，为自动驾驶系统中的3D检测模型提供了实用的压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

*Houzhang Fang,Shukai Guo,Qiuhuan Chen,Yi Chang,Luxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的运动红外小目标检测网络TDCNet，通过时间差分卷积重参数化模块和多尺度运动上下文特征提取，结合TDC引导的时空注意力机制，在复杂背景下实现准确的目标检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动红外小目标检测在实际应用中至关重要，但由于目标特征弱和背景干扰复杂，仍然极具挑战性。现有方法中，时间差分能利用运动线索但空间特征提取能力有限，而3D卷积能有效表示时空特征但缺乏对时间维度运动动态的显式感知。

Method: 提出了TDCNet网络，包含时间差分卷积重参数化模块（三个并行TDC块捕获不同时间范围的上下文依赖）和TDC引导的时空注意力机制（在TDC主干和并行3D主干之间进行交叉注意力建模全局语义依赖）。

Result: 在IRSTD-UAV和公共红外数据集上的大量实验表明，TDCNet在运动目标检测中达到了最先进的检测性能。

Conclusion: TDCNet通过有效提取和增强时空特征，在复杂背景下显著提高了检测性能，为运动红外小目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a critical role in practical applications, such as surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and UAV-based search system. Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Flora方法解决零样本骨架动作识别问题，通过灵活邻居感知语义调整和开放形式分布感知流分类器，解决了现有方法中的点对点对齐脆弱性和分类器决策边界僵化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本骨架动作识别方法存在两个基本问题：(1)由于不完美语义导致的脆弱点对点对齐；(2)静态决策边界和粗粒度锚点限制的僵化分类器。

Method: Flora方法包含两个核心组件：1）灵活邻居感知语义调整，通过融入相邻类间上下文线索形成方向感知区域语义，结合跨模态几何一致性目标确保稳定的点对区域对齐；2）开放形式分布感知流分类器，使用无噪声流匹配弥合语义和骨架潜在嵌入之间的模态分布差距，同时通过无条件对比正则化增强可区分性。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，即使在仅使用10%可见数据训练时也表现出色。

Conclusion: Flora方法通过创新的语义调整和流分类器设计，有效解决了零样本骨架动作识别中的关键挑战，在多个数据集上取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OUGS框架，通过基于3D高斯基元物理参数的显式不确定性建模，结合语义分割实现对象感知的主动重建，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅在复杂场景中特定对象重建的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动重建方法依赖场景级不确定性度量，容易受到无关背景干扰，导致对象中心任务中的视图选择效率低下。需要更原则性的不确定性建模来提升特定对象的重建效果。

Method: 从3D高斯基元的物理参数（位置、尺度、旋转）直接推导不确定性，通过渲染雅可比矩阵传播协方差，建立可解释的不确定性模型。结合语义分割掩码生成对象感知的不确定性评分，实现针对性的主动视图选择。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了3DGS重建过程的效率，相比现有最先进方法在目标对象上实现了更高质量的重建，同时作为全局场景的鲁棒不确定性估计器。

Conclusion: OUGS框架通过物理基础的不确定性建模和对象感知策略，有效解决了复杂场景中特定对象高效重建的挑战，为3D高斯泼溅提供了更精确和高效的重建能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美式足球运动员跟踪面临频繁遮挡和身体接触等挑战，但缺乏标准化数据集，难以公平比较不同方法。

Method: 构建首个美式足球运动员检测与跟踪数据集，比较评估多种检测和跟踪方法，包括微调检测模型和集成重识别模型。

Result: 在拥挤场景中实现了准确检测和跟踪，微调检测模型性能优于预训练模型，集成微调检测器和重识别模型显著提升了跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 这项工作使得在传统方法难以应对的高密度挑战性场景中，能够实现鲁棒的美式足球运动员检测与跟踪。

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双教师知识蒸馏框架，利用ViT和CNN教师协同指导轻量CNN学生，通过差异感知教师加权和结构差异感知蒸馏策略，在视频动作识别任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有跨架构知识蒸馏方法中存在的架构不匹配问题，同时充分利用同构CNN教师的价值，以提升轻量CNN在视频动作识别中的性能。

Method: 1. 差异感知教师加权：基于教师置信度和与学生预测差异动态融合ViT和CNN教师的预测；2. 结构差异感知蒸馏：通过轻量辅助分支学习ViT与CNN教师间的残差特征，专注可转移的架构差异。

Result: 在HMDB51、EPIC-KITCHENS-100和Kinetics-400基准测试中一致优于最先进蒸馏方法，在HMDB51上最高获得5.95%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 双教师知识蒸馏框架有效解决了架构不匹配问题，通过协同利用异构和同构教师，显著提升了轻量CNN在视频动作识别中的性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

TL;DR: vMFCoOp是一个在超球面流形上使用冯·米塞斯-费希尔分布来对齐LLM和CLIP语义偏差的框架，通过统一语义锚点实现稳健的生物医学提示学习和优越的小样本分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM和CLIP变体之间由于训练语料和模型架构差异导致的语义错位问题，以及传统欧几里得空间优化在多模态对齐中缺乏统一表示能力和局部几何约束能力的问题。

Method: 在共享超球面流形上逆估计冯·米塞斯-费希尔分布，通过统一语义锚点对齐任意LLM和CLIP骨干网络的语义偏差，基于三个互补约束实现稳健的生物医学提示学习。

Result: 在14个医疗数据集、12种医学成像模态和13个解剖区域上表现一致改进，在准确性、泛化性和临床适用性方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: vMFCoOp框架通过超球面流形上的分布估计有效解决了生物医学视觉语言模型中的语义对齐问题，为小样本适应提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in context optimization (CoOp) guided by large language model (LLM)-distilled medical semantic priors offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering and full fine-tuning for adapting biomedical CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs). However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability. This work will be continuously expanded to encompass more downstream applications, and the corresponding resources are intended to be shared through https://github.com/VinyehShaw/UniEqui.

*Isaac Robinson,Peter Robicheaux,Matvei Popov,Deva Ramanan,Neehar Peri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RF-DETR是一个轻量级的目标检测器，通过神经架构搜索发现任意目标数据集的精度-延迟Pareto曲线，在COCO和Roboflow100-VL数据集上显著优于现有实时检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇检测器在COCO上表现良好，但在包含预训练中未见类别的真实世界数据集上泛化能力不足。作者希望避免直接微调大型视觉语言模型，而是开发轻量级专用检测器。

Method: 提出RF-DETR，基于预训练基础网络在目标数据集上微调，通过权重共享神经架构搜索评估数千种网络配置的精度-延迟权衡，无需重新训练。重新审视NAS的"可调旋钮"以提升DETR在不同目标域的迁移性。

Result: RF-DETR在COCO上达到48.0 AP，比D-FINE(nano)高5.3 AP且延迟相近；在Roboflow100-VL上比GroundingDINO(tiny)高1.2 AP且快20倍。RF-DETR(2x-large)是首个在COCO上超过60 AP的实时检测器。

Conclusion: RF-DETR通过轻量级设计和神经架构搜索，在多个数据集上实现了精度和速度的最佳平衡，为实时目标检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary detectors achieve impressive performance on COCO, but often fail to generalize to real-world datasets with out-of-distribution classes not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the "tunable knobs" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves on prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast. To the best of our knowledge, RF-DETR (2x-large) is the first real-time detector to surpass 60 AP on COCO. Our code is at https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用LLM和AMR图将英语翻译成ASP程序的新方法，用于解决逻辑谜题，相比现有方法减少了LLM的使用范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP是一种强大的组合问题求解工具，但需要学习语法。随着非程序员与代码交互的需求增加，需要让不熟悉编程语言的人也能使用ASP。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，然后通过AMR图解析简化语言并系统生成ASP约束，最终创建完整的ASP程序。

Result: 系统成功创建了完整的ASP程序来解决组合逻辑问题，展示了该方法的能力。

Conclusion: 这是创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言到复杂逻辑问题求解系统的重要第一步。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Motivation: ARC-AGI是人类轻松解决但对AI系统极其困难的流体智力基准，受神经科学和心理学中人类智能建模方法的启发，旨在开发认知合理的求解器。

Method: 使用基于向量符号代数的神经符号方法，整合系统1直觉和系统2推理，通过面向对象的程序合成实现高效可解释的过程。

Conclusion: 这是首个将VSA应用于ARC-AGI的方法，开发了迄今为止最认知合理的ARC-AGI求解器，代码已开源。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

TL;DR: 提出了QDIN架构，将RL系统设计为可回答多种环境查询的推理引擎，而非仅专注于奖励最大化。研究发现推理准确性与控制性能存在解耦现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统RL仅关注奖励最大化的范式，探索将RL系统构建为能够回答环境多样性查询的推理引擎，以暴露环境知识（可达性、距离、价值、动态等）。

Method: 引入QDIN架构，将不同查询类型（策略、可达性、路径、比较）作为一等公民，为每种推理模式优化专门的神经模块。

Result: 发现推理准确性与控制性能存在根本性解耦：推理准确率可达近完美水平（99%可达性IoU），而控制性能仍保持次优（31%回报）。专门化架构在推理任务上优于统一模型和后验提取方法，同时保持竞争力控制性能。

Conclusion: 为RL系统确立了新的研究议程，即从设计之初就构建为可查询知识库，对可解释性、验证和人机协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为神经价值迭代的新POMDP规划算法，用神经网络替代传统的α向量来表示价值函数，解决了大规模POMDP问题的计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于α向量的POMDP求解器在大规模问题上计算成本过高，因为每个α向量都是|S|维的，贝尔曼备份操作变得难以处理。

Method: 利用PWLC特性，将POMDP价值函数表示为有限个神经网络的集合，结合神经网络的泛化能力和经典价值迭代框架。

Result: 在现有离线求解器无法处理的大规模POMDP中获得了接近最优的解。

Conclusion: 神经网络表示为大规模POMDP规划提供了可行的解决方案，结合了神经网络的泛化优势和传统价值迭代的框架。

Abstract: The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $α$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在教学中只能学习表面教学模式，缺乏动态适应能力；现有强化学习方法无法区分学生是否真正理解，也不能感知学生实时认知状态变化。

Method: UCO方法采用多轮交互强化学习范式，包含两个协同奖励函数：Progress Reward评估学生从困惑到理解的认知进步，Scaffold Reward动态识别学生的最近发展区。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试中，UCO模型优于所有同等规模的基线模型，性能可与先进闭源模型相媲美。

Conclusion: UCO方法通过认知优化有效提升了LLM作为智能导师的教学适应能力，解决了现有方法在认知状态感知和动态教学调整方面的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

Motivation: 开发能够在复杂3D开放世界中完成长时间复杂任务的通用智能体，统一感知、推理和行动过程，实现人类级别的任务完成效率。

Method: 采用端到端的视觉语言模型，以5Hz处理原始像素，生成30Hz的键盘鼠标动作，仅在必要时进行推理，在《原神》中进行训练。

Result: 成功完成《原神》5小时蒙德主线剧情，效率达到人类水平；在《鸣潮》中完成100分钟任务，在《崩坏：星穹铁道》中完成5小时第一章剧情，均无需微调。

Conclusion: Lumine在开放世界环境中展现出强大的跨游戏泛化能力，为通用智能体的发展迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

Motivation: 探讨AI系统作为递归认知代理如何处理其他物种的递归通信过程，以及这种相遇可能如何系统性地模糊或扭曲物种间的通信结构。

Method: 基于哲学家Yuk Hui关于递归性和偶然性的工作，分析AI系统与物种通信之间的双重偶然性问题。

Result: 发现AI系统不是中立的模式检测器，而是递归认知代理，其信息处理可能系统性地遮蔽或扭曲其他物种的通信结构。

Conclusion: 需要将生物声学AI从通用模式识别重新概念化为不同形式递归认知之间的外交性相遇，这对模型设计、评估框架和研究方法都有影响。

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

Motivation: 当前时间序列预测方法缺乏人类专家的交互、推理和适应能力，限制了在复杂现实环境中的实用性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1)自动化预测准备，构建多源认知基础；2)生成式推理和反射优化，通过元推理循环进行持续自校正和策略优化。

Result: 在短期和长期数据集上的广泛实验表明，AlphaCast在预测准确性方面持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过人类智慧与LLM智能的协同推理，重新定义了时间序列预测为交互式过程，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于图神经网络的方法来近似计算ABA框架中的可信接受度，通过两种GNN架构在ICCMA基准上取得了优于现有方法的性能，并开发了多项式时间的扩展重构算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于假设的论证(ABA)是强大的结构化论证形式，但在稳定语义下精确计算扩展对于大型框架是难解的，需要可扩展的近似推理方法。

Method: 将ABA框架建模为依赖图，编码假设、声明和规则作为节点，使用异构边标签区分支持、推导和攻击关系。提出了ABAGCN和ABAGAT两种GNN架构，分别使用残差异构卷积层和注意力层来学习节点嵌入。

Result: ABAGCN和ABAGAT在ICCMA基准上优于最先进的GNN基线，节点级F1得分最高达0.71。扩展重构算法在小ABAF上F1超过0.85，在大型框架上保持约0.58的F1。

Conclusion: 这项工作为结构化论证中的可扩展近似推理开辟了新途径，证明了GNN在ABA框架近似计算中的有效性。

Abstract: Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型表现出卓越的流畅性，但研究者仍在努力从中提取更强的推理能力。基于搜索的LLM计算解释，本文旨在建立一个系统框架来理解LLM推理和优化。

Method: 设计了一个实验，比较简单线性管道与包含递归精炼层的复杂结构化管道。多智能体模型基于三位美国开国元勋的历史人物构建，使用RAG增强语料库，并生成对三个当代政治议题的回应。

Result: 复杂模型在所有九个测试案例中始终优于简单模型，平均仲裁分数为88.3对71.7。复杂模型的论证在分析深度、结构细微差别和战略框架方面更优越。

Conclusion: 递归精炼是通过GIS搜索增强LLM推理的强大架构特征，高质量推理是一种受控的增量搜索过程。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理和工具使用方面取得突破，但在执行类似人类组织和社会规模的长程任务时存在持续错误率问题，无法扩展到数百步以上。

Conclusion: 大规模分解代理过程（MDAPs）可能比持续改进当前LLMs更有效地解决组织和社会层面的问题。

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在公共道路上部署时面临各种驾驶危险，需要具备持续监控危险和自适应响应安全违规的能力，以在复杂驾驶场景中保持稳健的驾驶行为。

Method: Argus框架持续监控ADS生成的轨迹，当EGO车辆被认为不安全时，通过危险缓解器无缝接管控制。

Conclusion: Argus有效且高效地增强了自动驾驶系统的韧性，显著提高了驾驶性能并减少了安全违规。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Conclusion: OR-R1为自动化OR优化问题建模和求解提供了稳健、可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，降低了工业应用的专业知识和数据门槛。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

Result: 在多个GUI相关基准测试中的综合评估表明，该方法在增强GUI代理短期记忆和屏幕细节感知方面具有有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: HAR框架成功解决了GUI代理历史无关推理的问题，为GUI自动化提供了更可靠的情景推理能力。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Conclusion: 详细的错误分析揭示了几个普遍问题，为未来的改进指明了具体方向，强调需要更全面的过程评估方法来提升GUI代理的性能。

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and interactive technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agent, as the carrier connecting goal-oriented natural language and real-world devices, has received widespread attention from the community. Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.

Conclusion: 该方法从理论上证明了新奖励在方差减少和改进收敛特性方面的优越性，在实践中证明了其有效性和标记效率，为解决大推理模型的过度思考问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

*Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Ta-Jung Chien,Chun-Kai Huang,Shao-Hua Sun,Che Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MedFuse框架，通过乘法融合模块MuFuse处理不规则临床时间序列，在多个真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床时间序列具有不规则性、异步采样和缺失值等问题，现有嵌入策略通过加法操作结合特征身份和值嵌入，限制了捕捉值依赖特征交互的能力。

Method: 开发了MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse模块，通过乘法调制融合值和特征嵌入，保留特征特定信息的同时建模跨特征的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，MedFuse在关键预测任务上持续优于最先进的基线方法，学习到的表示显示乘法融合增强了表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse为建模不规则临床时间序列提供了一个可推广的方法，乘法融合机制有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

*Minlan Shao,Zijian Zhang,Yili Wang,Yiwei Dai,Xu Shen,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyperD是一个用于交通预测的新框架，通过将交通数据解耦为周期性和残差分量来应对复杂时空依赖性和多尺度周期性模式的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测面临两个关键挑战：复杂的空间依赖性和多尺度周期性模式与不规则波动的共存。现有方法难以同时有效处理这些因素。

Method: 提出HyperD框架，将交通数据解耦为周期性和残差分量。周期性分量通过混合周期性表示模块处理，残差分量通过频域感知残差表示模块建模。引入双视图对齐损失来强制两个分量的语义分离。

Result: 在四个真实世界交通数据集上的实验表明，HyperD实现了最先进的预测精度，同时在干扰下具有更好的鲁棒性和更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: HyperD通过解耦周期性和非周期性模式，有效提升了交通预测的性能，为智能交通系统提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出从"模型训练"转向"模型培育"的新范式，将价值观对齐融入模型开发全过程，通过重构训练语料库实现从第一个训练token开始的价值观早期承诺


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法只在核心能力建立后才进行价值观对齐，导致模型容易失准且缺乏深层次价值体系。在大模型能力开始超越人类的背景下，需要从根本上改变训练范式

Method: 重构训练语料库：采用第一人称视角、将信息重新情境化为生活经验、模拟社交互动、搭建训练数据排序的脚手架

Result: 预期这种方法将实现从第一个训练token开始的价值观早期承诺，使知识、技能和价值观内在更难以分离

Conclusion: 在大型语言模型能力开始超越人类的生态系统中，这种从训练到培育的范式转变是至关重要的需求

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI主要推动了定量方法的发展，但定性研究被忽视。研究人员被迫使用通用AI工具如ChatGPT来处理定性数据，但这些工具存在偏见、不透明、不可重复和隐私问题。

Method: 通过回顾近期文献，分析现有自动化发现流程如何通过增强定性能力来改进，并识别安全定性AI在多学科和混合方法研究中的关键机会。

Conclusion: 开发专门的定性AI系统对于实现全面的科学理解和推进多学科混合方法研究至关重要，能够弥补当前AI在定性维度上的不足。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的智能体框架，用于自动合成动态系统的屏障证书，通过自然语言推理来提出、优化和验证候选证书，在100个系统的基准测试中达到90%以上的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前屏障证书合成方法存在可扩展性差、依赖精心设计的模板、需要大量手动专业知识等问题，需要探索能否通过语言模型捕获和操作化专家推理过程。

Method: 使用LLM驱动的智能体框架，结合自然语言推理进行模板发现，集成SMT验证，支持屏障-控制器协同合成以确保安全证书与控制器的兼容性。

Result: 在BarrierBench基准测试（包含100个线性、非线性、离散和连续时间动态系统）中，框架成功生成有效证书的比例超过90%。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了语言模型在形式化验证中的潜力，通过发布BarrierBench基准和工具链，为推进基于语言推理与形式验证的集成建立了社区测试平台。

Abstract: Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.
  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.
  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.
  The benchmark is publicly available at https://hycodev.com/dataset/barrierbench

Motivation: 评估前沿LLM在端到端规划任务中的推理能力，并与传统规划器进行对比。

Method: 使用国际规划竞赛学习赛道中的PDDL领域子集，测试DeepSeek R1、Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5和LAMA规划器，并引入混淆测试评估纯推理能力。

Result: GPT-5在标准PDDL领域表现与LAMA竞争，所有LLM在混淆测试中性能下降但程度较之前模型更轻。

Conclusion: LLM在规划任务上相比前代有显著改进，与规划器的性能差距在具有挑战性的基准测试中缩小。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

TL;DR: CrochetBench是一个评估多模态大语言模型在钩针编织领域进行细粒度、低层次程序推理能力的基准测试，强调从描述转向实际操作，要求模型识别针法、选择结构适当的指令并生成可编译的钩针程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注高层次描述或视觉问答，缺乏对实际执行能力的评估。CrochetBench旨在填补这一空白，通过评估模型在真实创造性领域中的程序能力。

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和通过执行进行功能评估。基准测试涵盖针法分类、指令基础、自然语言到DSL翻译和图像到DSL翻译等任务。

Result: 在所有任务中，当评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，模型性能急剧下降，暴露了长距离符号推理和3D感知程序合成的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新视角，并突显了在真实创造性领域中表面理解与可执行精度之间的差距。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Motivation: 传统基于检查模型输出或激活的方法无法检测所有风险，需要一种架构无关的补充方法，通过模型聚合来增强安全性。

Method: 使用共识采样算法，利用模型计算输出概率的能力，当足够多的安全模型达成共识时输出结果，否则弃权。算法受Vyas等人(2023)的可证明版权保护算法启发。

Result: 该方法能够实现与k个模型中最安全的s个模型平均风险相当的安全性，并在模型间共识不足时通过弃权避免风险。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种新的模型无关AI安全方法，通过从模型集合中未知的安全子集放大安全保证，为单个可靠模型提供安全性。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

Conclusion: RPO和RPG方法有效解决了对抗优化在合作设置中的自我破坏问题，扩展了对抗优化算法的应用范围。

Abstract: Adversarial optimization algorithms that explicitly search for flaws in agents' policies have been successfully applied to finding robust and diverse policies in multi-agent settings. However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

TL;DR: 本文比较了广度优先搜索(BrFS)和重启随机游走(RRW)两种逃离无信息启发式区域(UHR)的方法，分析了它们的期望运行时间，并在EHC算法中进行了实证评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贪婪搜索方法如GBFS和EHC在面临启发式局部极小值或平台等无信息启发式区域(UHR)时往往表现不佳，需要有效的逃离机制。

Method: 理论推导BrFS和RRW逃离UHR的期望运行时间，并基于此开发EHC-RRW变体，使用RRW替代BrFS来逃离UHR，在PDDL规划基准上进行实验比较。

Result: EHC-RRW在EHC原本有效的场景中具有强期望运行时间保证，实验验证了RRW在某些情况下比BrFS更有效地逃离UHR。

Conclusion: 重启随机游走(RRW)是逃离无信息启发式区域的有效方法，EHC-RRW变体在某些情况下优于标准EHC算法。

Abstract: Greedy search methods like Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and Enforced Hill-Climbing (EHC) often struggle when faced with Uninformed Heuristic Regions (UHRs) like heuristic local minima or plateaus. In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective. We also run experiments with these approaches on PDDL planning benchmarks to better understand their relative effectiveness for escaping UHRs.
