While this moisture increase is often viewed as beneficial for water availability, it remains unclear whether the hydrological system itself is becoming more resilient or drifting toward instability. Here we apply an entropy-based framework to quantify the changing structural organization of the TP's soil moisture system. We show that from 2000 to 2024, regional wetting has driven a long-term decline in entropy, reflecting an increase in system order and stability due to enhanced hydrological buffering capacity. This stability is modulated by the El Ni$\u00f1$o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which regulates regional heterogeneity via a distinct spatial dipole. Crucially, however, CMIP6 climate projections reveal an alarming reversal: future warming triggers a rise in entropy. This transition signals a loss of systemic resilience, characterized by intensified spatial disorder and potential abrupt regime shifts by the mid-century. Our findings suggest that while current wetting provides a stabilizing buffer, continued warming is projected to amplify spatial heterogeneity, thereby destabilizing the Asian Water Tower, with significant risks for downstream water security.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9752\u85cf\u9ad8\u539f\u571f\u58e4\u6c34\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u71b5\u503c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u5f53\u524d\u6e7f\u6da6\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u6765\u53d8\u6696\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u71b5\u503c\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5931\u7a33\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u4e9a\u6d32\u6c34\u5854\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u9752\u85cf\u9ad8\u539f\u4f5c\u4e3a\"\u4e9a\u6d32\u6c34\u5854\"\u6b63\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u6e7f\u6da6\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u79cd\u6c34\u5206\u589e\u52a0\u662f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6c34\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u8fd8\u662f\u4f7f\u5176\u8d8b\u4e8e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u571f\u58e4\u6c34\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u91cf\u5316\u9752\u85cf\u9ad8\u539f\u571f\u58e4\u6c34\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53d8\u5316\uff082000-2024\u5e74\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790ENSO\u5bf9\u533a\u57df\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528CMIP6\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "2000-2024\u5e74\u533a\u57df\u6e7f\u6da6\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u71b5\u503c\u957f\u671f\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u5e8f\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff1bENSO\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u8c03\u8282\u533a\u57df\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff1b\u4f46CMIP6\u9884\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u672a\u6765\u53d8\u6696\u5c06\u5f15\u53d1\u71b5\u503c\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u97e7\u6027\u4e27\u5931\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u672c\u4e16\u7eaa\u4e2d\u53f6\u53d1\u751f\u7a81\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6e7f\u6da6\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7f13\u51b2\uff0c\u4f46\u6301\u7eed\u53d8\u6696\u5c06\u52a0\u5267\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e9a\u6d32\u6c34\u5854\u5931\u7a33\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u6c34\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Our multivariate linear model simultaneously captures these amplitude-modulated seasonal cycles along with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which naturally emerges as an intrinsic feature of the system rather than a separate phenomenon. Using sixteen-dimensional regression based on four spatially distributed time series per variable, the model delivers unprecedented forecast accuracy for both interannual amplitude modulations and PDO evolution, maintaining skill beyond 36 months -- a substantial improvement over current operational and research forecasts, including machine learning methods. Predictions initialized in 2024 project that the PDO will remain in its negative phase through late 2026, implying reduced likelihood of severe marine heatwaves in the eastern North Pacific during this period. These findings have direct implications for regional climate impacts, including storm tracks, precipitation patterns, and marine ecosystem health. By treating seasonal and interannual variability as coupled rather than independent processes, this framework advances our understanding of North Pacific climate dynamics and provides a powerful tool for stakeholders managing climate-sensitive resources and planning adaptation strategies in regions strongly influenced by North Pacific conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5317\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u6d77\u6e29\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5e74\u9645\u53d8\u5316\u4e3b\u8981\u53cd\u6620\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5b63\u8282\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u632f\u5e45\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u5143\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u632f\u5e45\u8c03\u5236\u5b63\u8282\u5faa\u73af\u548cPDO\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5317\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u6d77\u6e29\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u5728\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5b63\u8282\u548c\u5e74\u9645\u53d8\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4e3a\u533a\u57df\u6c14\u5019\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5143\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5e74\u9645\u53d8\u5316\u89c6\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5b63\u8282\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u632f\u5e45\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56db\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5341\u516d\u7ef4\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u632f\u5e45\u8c03\u5236\u5b63\u8282\u5faa\u73af\u548cPDO\uff0c\u5c06PDO\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e74\u9645\u632f\u5e45\u8c03\u5236\u548cPDO\u6f14\u53d8\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8d85\u8fc736\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u4e1a\u52a1\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u30022024\u5e74\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u663e\u793aPDO\u5c06\u57282026\u5e74\u5e95\u524d\u4fdd\u6301\u8d1f\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e1c\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u4e25\u91cd\u6d77\u6d0b\u70ed\u6d6a\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5b63\u8282\u548c\u5e74\u9645\u53d8\u5316\u89c6\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u800c\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5bf9\u5317\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u6c14\u5019\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ba1\u7406\u6c14\u5019\u654f\u611f\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

By applying the blocktrack algorithm to ERA5 reanalysis and a CMIP6 model ensemble, we identify and track blocking events over Greenland, and obtain their trajectories, intensities, durations and wave-breaking characteristics. Two types of Greenland Blocking (GB) are identified in ERA5 via the Wave Breaking Index, respectively characterized by anticyclonic and cyclonic wave breaking. These correspond to the previously identified upstream and retrograding GBs. Upstream blocks, which originate in Northern Canada, exhibit stronger moisture transport before and during the blocking onset and higher temperature anomalies than retrograding blocks, which follow a east-to-west trajectory and originate in the Northern Atlantic. Our analyses show how the recent observed increase in the frequency of GB, particularly in 2012, is primarily driven by upstream blocks. CMIP6 models generally fail to capture the increase seen in observations and underestimate GB variability. Future projections under the SSP370 scenario show a decline in retrograding blocks but a possible increase in upstream blocks, depending on the detection index used. We discuss possible drivers of these changes, which include jet stream position shifts, increased frequency of high moisture transport events from the equator to the high latitudes, surface temperature increases due to Atlantic Multidecadal Variability and Arctic Amplification. By analyzing block trajectories, this study demonstrates how Lagrangian diagnostics can provide novel insights into the dynamics of blocking events over Greenland.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528blocktrack\u5de5\u5177\u4ece\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u683c\u9675\u5170\u590f\u5b63\u5927\u6c14\u963b\u585e\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u963b\u585e\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CMIP6\u6a21\u578b\u4f4e\u4f30\u963b\u585e\u53d8\u7387\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u963b\u585e\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0d\u540c", "motivation": "\u4ece\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u683c\u9675\u5170\u590f\u5b63\u5927\u6c14\u963b\u585e\u7684\u8868\u793a\u548c\u672a\u6765\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u7684blocktrack\u5de5\u5177\u5206\u6790\u963b\u585e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6ce2\u7834\u788e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u963b\u585e\u9891\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u539f\u56e0", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528blocktrack\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u7406ERA5\u518d\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u548cCMIP6\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u683c\u9675\u5170\u963b\u585e\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce2\u7834\u788e\u6307\u6570\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u963b\u585e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u7279\u5f81", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u683c\u9675\u5170\u963b\u585e\u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u4e0a\u6e38\u578b\uff08\u6e90\u81ea\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u5317\u90e8\uff09\u548c\u9006\u884c\u578b\uff08\u6e90\u81ea\u5317\u5927\u897f\u6d0b\uff09\u3002\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u963b\u585e\u9891\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e0a\u6e38\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\uff0cCMIP6\u6a21\u578b\u4f4e\u4f30\u963b\u585e\u53d8\u7387\u3002\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u9006\u884c\u578b\u963b\u585e\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4e0a\u6e38\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0", "conclusion": "\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u683c\u9675\u5170\u963b\u585e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u963b\u585e\u53d8\u5316\u53d7\u6025\u6d41\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u7eac\u5ea6\u6c34\u6c7d\u8f93\u9001\u589e\u52a0\u3001\u5927\u897f\u6d0b\u591a\u5e74\u4ee3\u9645\u53d8\u7387\u548c\u5317\u6781\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u9a71\u52a8"}}

However, existing methods rely on multi-timestep training and reconfigurable computing architectures, which increases computational and memory overhead, thus reducing deployment efficiency. This work presents an efficient and lightweight residual SNN accelerator that combines algorithm and hardware co-design to optimize inference energy efficiency. In terms of the algorithm, we employ single-timesteps training, integrate grouped convolutions, and fuse batch normalization (BN) layers, thus compressing the network to only 0.69M parameters. Quantization-aware training (QAT) further constrains all parameters to 8-bit precision. In terms of hardware, the reuse of intra-layer resources maximizes FPGA utilization, a full pipeline cross-layer architecture improves throughput, and on-chip block RAM (BRAM) stores network parameters and intermediate results to improve memory efficiency.

The model is built using the Anemoi framework for creating machine learning weather forecasting systems, developed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and partners. The model is based on a graph neural network, and is capable of simulating water level due to storm surge at a horizontal resolution of 4 km and a temporal resolution of 1 hour with a quality comparable to the numerical model on which it was trained. The model was trained using a data set consisting of 43 years of atmospheric data from the 3-km Norwegian Reanalysis hindcast for mean sea level pressure and winds, and the NORA-Surge hindcast for storm surge. Evaluation was done by comparing results from hindcast runs of the Flo model against independent observations of more than 90 water level gauges along the European coast, and against the NORA-Surge hindcast. The evaluation shows that Flo produces hindcasts with accuracy similar to the NORA-Surge hindcast. Since no data assimilation was applied in the NORA-Surge hindcast used as training data, the Flo model is not expected to outperform the numerical model when compared to observations. The current work takes an important step transforming storm surge forecasting from being based purely on numerical physics-based models, to taking advantage of recent advancements in machine learning. This does not represent a large step forward with regards to improving the forecast skill, but forms a foundation for future training of a storm surge model that offers more flexibility for taking observations into account.", "AI": {"tldr": "Flo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u98ce\u66b4\u6f6e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u5317\u6d77\u3001\u632a\u5a01\u6d77\u548c\u5df4\u4f26\u652f\u6d77\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee54\u516c\u91cc\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c1\u5c0f\u65f6\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u62df\u98ce\u66b4\u6f6e\u6c34\u4f4d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6240\u7528\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u98ce\u66b4\u6f6e\u9884\u62a5\u4ece\u7eaf\u6570\u503c\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5411\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u8003\u8651\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u98ce\u66b4\u6f6e\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ECMWF\u7684Anemoi\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e43\u5e74\u5927\u6c14\u6570\u636e\uff083\u516c\u91cc\u632a\u5a01\u518d\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\uff09\u548cNORA-Surge\u98ce\u66b4\u6f6e\u540e\u62a5\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "Flo\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u62a5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0eNORA-Surge\u540e\u62a5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u572890\u591a\u4e2a\u6b27\u6d32\u6d77\u5cb8\u6c34\u4f4d\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ad9\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u8d85\u8d8a\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u98ce\u66b4\u6f6e\u9884\u62a5\u4ece\u7eaf\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u62a5\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u8003\u8651\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Although a comprehensive master plan has been proposed, its implementation requires substantial financial investment, which remains constrained in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), an emerging economy. This research proposes a traffic flow based algorithm to support the development of priority road segments. The objective is to enable more effective prioritisation of road construction projects and facilitate the optimal allocation of limited infrastructure budgets.\n  Methods: The study was conducted by formulating a standard transport network design problem (TNDP) that included estimated origin demand data specific to the city of Kinshasa. Given the high computational nature of the 30 node network design, TNDP relevant metaheuristics (GA, ACO, PSO, SA, TS, Greedy) were used selectively and hybridised to achieve high quality, stable solutions. A greedy search seeded simulated annealing and Tabu search were devised to achieve the design goals.\n  Results: Greedy Simulated Annealing and Greedy Tabu search yielded the best travel time reduction and the most stable solutions compared to other solvers, also improving network edge betweenness centrality by nearly a scale of two and a half.\n  Conclusions: Road priorities were proposed, including junctions connecting the Bandundu and Kongo Central entry point to main attraction centres (Limete Poids Lourd, Gombe, Airport) and additional inner city areas (Ngaliema, Selembao, Lemba, Masina, Kimwenza).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u548c\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7981\u5fcc\u641c\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u9053\u8def\u5efa\u8bbe\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u91d1\u6c99\u8428\u4ea4\u901a\u62e5\u5835\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u6c99\u8428\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u4ea4\u901a\u62e5\u5835\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6218\u7565\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6269\u5bb9\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u603b\u4f53\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4f46\u521a\u679c\u6c11\u4e3b\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u8d44\u91d1\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5148\u5efa\u8bbe\u6700\u5173\u952e\u7684\u8def\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff08TNDP\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91d1\u6c99\u8428\u7684\u8d77\u70b9\u9700\u6c42\u6570\u636e\u3002\u9488\u5bf930\u8282\u70b9\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4f7f\u7528\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u8681\u7fa4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u3001\u7981\u5fcc\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6df7\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u8d2a\u5a6a\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u548c\u7981\u5fcc\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u548c\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7981\u5fcc\u641c\u7d22\u5728\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u7f51\u7edc\u8fb9\u4ecb\u6570\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fd12.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u5efa\u8bbe\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8fde\u63a5\u73ed\u987f\u675c\u548c\u521a\u679c\u4e2d\u592e\u5165\u53e3\u70b9\u5230\u4e3b\u8981\u5438\u5f15\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08\u5229\u6885\u7279\u91cd\u578b\u8f66\u533a\u3001\u8d21\u8d1d\u3001\u673a\u573a\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u5185\u57ce\u533a\uff08\u6069\u52a0\u5229\u9a6c\u3001\u585e\u4f26\u535a\u3001\u4f26\u5df4\u3001\u9a6c\u897f\u7eb3\u3001\u91d1\u6587\u624e\uff09\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u53e3\u3002"}}

To establish a methodological basis for explainable emotion estimation without relying on external information such as physiological signals or subjective ratings, we have quantified \"pleasantness,\" \"surprise,\" and \"habituation\" solely from scene-level expression features of advertising videos, drawing on the free energy(FE) principle, which has provided a unified account of perception, learning, and behavior. In this framework, Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) has captured prediction error, Bayesian surprise (BS) has captured belief updates, and uncertainty (UN) has reflected prior ambiguity, and together they have formed the core components of FE. Using 1,059 15 s food video advertisements, the experiments have shown that KLD has reflected \"pleasantness\" associated with brand presentation, BS has captured \"surprise\" arising from informational complexity, and UN has reflected \"surprise\" driven by uncertainty in element types and spatial arrangements, as well as by the variability and quantity of presented elements. This study also identified three characteristic emotional patterns, namely uncertain stimulus, sustained high emotion, and momentary peak and decay, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed method. Robustness across nine hyperparameter settings and generalization tests with six types of Japanese advertising videos (three genres and two durations) confirmed that these tendencies remained stable. This work can be extended by integrating a wider range of expression elements and validating the approach through subjective ratings, ultimately guiding the development of technologies that can support the creation of more engaging advertising videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4ece\u5e7f\u544a\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u8868\u8fbe\u7279\u5f81\u91cf\u5316\"\u6109\u60a6\u5ea6\"\u3001\"\u60ca\u559c\"\u548c\"\u4e60\u60ef\u5316\"\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e7f\u544a\u89c2\u770b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u53cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5a92\u4f53\u6548\u679c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u672c\u8eab\u91cf\u5316\u60c5\u7eea\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Kullback-Leibler\u6563\u5ea6(KLD)\u6355\u6349\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u60ca\u559c(BS)\u6355\u6349\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027(UN)\u53cd\u6620\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u75281,059\u4e2a15\u79d2\u98df\u54c1\u5e7f\u544a\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4ece\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u8868\u8fbe\u7279\u5f81\u91cf\u5316\u60c5\u7eea\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "KLD\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u4e0e\u54c1\u724c\u5448\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\u7684\"\u6109\u60a6\u5ea6\"\uff0cBS\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\"\u60ca\u559c\"\uff0cUN\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5143\u7d20\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6392\u5217\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\"\u60ca\u559c\"\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u60c5\u7eea\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u523a\u6fc0\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u9ad8\u60c5\u7eea\u3001\u77ac\u65f6\u5cf0\u503c\u548c\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57289\u79cd\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u7c7b\u65e5\u672c\u5e7f\u544a\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u4e09\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u65f6\u957f\uff09\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u66f4\u591a\u8868\u8fbe\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u89c6\u9891\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Currently at risk under climate change, the sea-ice microbiome holds mysteries about evolution of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere, which require methodological innovation to be unravelled. Gaining microscopic insight into the internal structure and biology of sea ice has traditionally been limited to destructive and extrusive ice core sampling methods. Here we present an in situ microscopic imaging system to observe undisturbed living microorganisms directly within sea the ice matrix. The complex and heterogeneous nature of sea ice, including its water crystal lattice, brine channels, air bubbles, and various impurities, presents engineering challenges for the development of this imaging system. Despite the fragile nature of the sea-ice matrix, we could successfully deploy, test and use the new in situ microscope during a recent expedition on the icepack in Arctic. We collected numerous images of live and intact single-celled and colony-forming diatoms, and documented for the first time at such a high resolution some microphysical features of sea ice. The hardware and software design of the endoscope is presented along with acquisition results of the microstructure and diatom images. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential for this new in situ microscopic imaging system to transform the way we study sea ice and to allow a deeper understanding of its complex microstructure and living microorganisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u539f\u4f4d\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6d77\u6c34\u51b0\u57fa\u8d28\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u672a\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u6d3b\u5fae\u751f\u7269\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6d77\u51b0\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u539f\u4f4d\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d77\u51b0\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7740\u9002\u5e94\u6781\u7aef\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7fa4\u843d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5730\u7403\u751f\u547d\u6f14\u5316\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u7684\u51b0\u82af\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u5bdf\u6d77\u51b0\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u7684\u539f\u4f4d\u89c2\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u6d77\u51b0\u73af\u5883\u7684\u539f\u4f4d\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5317\u6781\u51b0\u5c42\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u5bdf\u6d77\u51b0\u57fa\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u6d3b\u5fae\u751f\u7269\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u7845\u85fb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u6d77\u51b0\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7269\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5728\u5317\u6781\u51b0\u5c42\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u8be5\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u6d3b\u4f53\u5b8c\u6574\u7845\u85fb\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u4ee5\u5982\u6b64\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86\u6d77\u51b0\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7269\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6d77\u51b0\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u539f\u4f4d\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u671b\u5f7b\u5e95\u6539\u53d8\u6d77\u51b0\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6d77\u51b0\u590d\u6742\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6d3b\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u5bf9\u7814\u7a76\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u6d77\u51b0\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

This paper introduces ChronoPlastic Spiking Neural Networks (CPSNNs), a novel architectural principle that enables adaptive temporal credit assignment by dynamically modulating synaptic decay rates conditioned on the state of the network. CPSNNs maintain multiple internal temporal traces and learn a continuous time-warping function that selectively preserves task-relevant information while rapidly forgetting noise. Unlike prior approaches based on adaptive membrane constants, attention mechanisms, or external memory, CPSNNs embed temporal control directly within local synaptic dynamics, preserving linear-time complexity and neuromorphic compatibility. We provide a formal description of the model, analyze its computational properties, and demonstrate empirically that CPSNNs learn long-gap temporal dependencies significantly faster and more reliably than standard SNN baselines.

The research introduces a multi-agent system with reinforcing learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, and real-time data absorption pipelines as a means of assessing the risk profiles of borrowers with few humans being involved. The processes consist of agent collaboration protocol, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles. Findings indicate that decision speed, transparency and responsiveness is better than traditional credit scoring models. Nevertheless, there are still some practical limitations such as risks of model drift, inconsistencies in interpreting high dimensional data and regulatory uncertainties as well as infrastructure limitations in low-resource settings. The suggested system has a high prospective to transform credit analytics and future studies ought to be directed on dynamic regulatory compliance mobilizers, new agent teamwork, adversarial robustness, and large-scale implementation in cross-country credit ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAgentic AI\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u878d\u670d\u52a1\u5feb\u901f\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u900f\u660e\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u6c42\u8feb\u5207\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73b0\u4ee3\u91d1\u878d\u8fd0\u8425\u6240\u9700\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgentic AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u5438\u6536\u7ba1\u9053\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u62ec\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u5f15\u64ce\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5c42\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u4e60\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6f02\u79fb\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u53d8\u9769\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u89c4\u673a\u5236\u3001\u65b0\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u56fd\u4fe1\u7528\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002"}}

Seven models were trained and assessed using accuracy, F1-score, and AUC. Grad-CAM visualizations provided explainability.\n  Results: Fine-tuned ResNet50 achieved the best performance: 99.43\\% accuracy, 99.61\\% F1-score, and 99.93\\% AUC, with only 3 misclassifications. Fine-tuning outperformed frozen-backbone models by 5.5 percentage points on average. Grad-CAM confirmed clinically relevant lung regions guided predictions.\n  Conclusions: Transfer learning with fine-tuning substantially outperforms CNNs trained from scratch for pediatric pneumonia detection, showing near-perfect accuracy.

Existing approaches--truncation and summarization--either discard early information or lose nuanced details. We introduce CogCanvas, a training-free framework that extracts verbatim-grounded cognitive artifacts (decisions, facts, reminders) from conversation turns and organizes them into a temporal-aware graph for compression-resistant retrieval.\n  On the LoCoMo benchmark, CogCanvas achieves 34.7% overall accuracy, outperforming RAG (25.6%, +9.1pp) and GraphRAG (13.7%, +21.0pp). The advantage is most pronounced on temporal reasoning: 31.5% vs. 9.3% (RAG) and 5.0% (GraphRAG)--a +530% relative improvement. On multi-hop causal reasoning, CogCanvas achieves 81.0% pass rate vs. 40.0% for GraphRAG (+41.0pp). Controlled benchmarks show 97.5% recall (+78.5pp vs. summarization) with 93.0% exact match preservation.\n  While heavily-optimized approaches achieve higher absolute scores through dedicated training (EverMemOS: approximately 92%), our training-free approach provides practitioners with an immediately-deployable alternative that significantly outperforms standard baselines.

In this study, we combine a focused review of cardiac ultrasound segmentation literature with a controlled comparison of three influential architectures, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet, on the Cardiac Acquisitions for Multi-Structure Ultrasound Segmentation (CAMUS) echocardiography dataset. Our benchmark spans multiple preprocessing routes, including native NIfTI volumes, 16-bit PNG exports, GPT-assisted polygon-based pseudo-labels, and self-supervised pretraining (SSL) on thousands of unlabeled cine frames. Using identical training splits, losses, and evaluation criteria, a plain U-Net achieved a 94% mean Dice when trained directly on NIfTI data (preserving native dynamic range), while the PNG-16-bit workflow reached 91% under similar conditions. Attention U-Net provided modest improvements on small or low-contrast regions, reducing boundary leakage, whereas TransUNet demonstrated the strongest generalization on challenging frames due to its ability to model global spatial context, particularly when initialized with SSL. Pseudo-labeling expanded the training set and improved robustness after confidence filtering. Overall, our contributions are threefold: a harmonized, apples-to-apples benchmark of U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet under standardized CAMUS preprocessing and evaluation; practical guidance on maintaining intensity fidelity, resolution consistency, and alignment when preparing ultrasound data; and an outlook on scalable self-supervision and emerging multimodal GPT-based annotation pipelines for rapid labeling, quality assurance, and targeted dataset curation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u5fc3\u810f\u8d85\u58f0\u5206\u5272\u6587\u732e\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728CAMUS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9U-Net\u3001Attention U-Net\u548cTransUNet\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7efc\u8ff0\u5927\u591a\u603b\u7ed3\u5fc3\u810f\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e3a\u5fc3\u810f\u8d85\u58f0\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5728CAMUS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5212\u5206\u3001\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83U-Net\u3001Attention U-Net\u548cTransUNet\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u539f\u751fNIfTI\u6570\u636e\u300116\u4f4dPNG\u5bfc\u51fa\u3001GPT\u8f85\u52a9\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u5343\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u5e27\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u751fNIfTI\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684U-Net\u8fbe\u523094%\u5e73\u5747Dice\u5206\u6570\uff0cPNG-16\u4f4d\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e3a91%\u3002Attention U-Net\u5728\u5c0f\u533a\u57df\u548c\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fb9\u754c\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff1bTransUNet\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5e27\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u3002\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548cGPT\u8f85\u52a9\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This growing trend necessitates advanced benchmarks for the rigorous evaluation of optimization algorithms under realistic conditions. This paper introduces a comprehensive and principled framework for constructing highly realistic and challenging DMOO benchmarks. The proposed framework features several novel components: a generalized formulation that allows the Pareto-optimal Set (PS) to change on hypersurfaces, a mechanism for creating controlled variable contribution imbalances to generate heterogeneous landscapes, and dynamic rotation matrices for inducing time-varying variable interactions and non-separability. Furthermore, we incorporate a temporal perturbation mechanism to simulate irregular environmental changes and propose a generalized time-linkage mechanism that systematically embeds historical solution quality into future problems, thereby capturing critical real-world phenomena such as error accumulation and time-deception. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating its superiority over conventional benchmarks in terms of realism, complexity, and its capability for discriminating state-of-the-art algorithmic performance.

Ellis-Mohr", "Max Hartman", "Lav R. Varshney"], "title": "Energy-Aware Routing to Large Reasoning Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have heterogeneous inference energy costs based on which model is used and how much it reasons. To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies. Routing behavior is characterized when dispatch policies are based on training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u5e73\u8861\u57fa\u7ebf\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u6784\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4ee5\u5408\u9002\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u6e90\u4f9b\u5e94\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5b9a\u5f8b\u6765\u5236\u5b9a\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6267\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5438\u6536\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u5c55\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u8def\u7531\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4e8c\u9636\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e34\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

The dataset comprises 7,700 samples collected from 34 participants using a custom \\(16\\times 16\\) tactile sensor array operating at 120 Hz, encoded as 1,005,592 spike events through adaptive temporal differentiation. Following EMNIST's visual character recognition protocol, STEMNIST addresses the critical gap between simplified digit classification and real-world tactile interaction scenarios requiring alphanumeric discrimination. Baseline experiments using conventional CNNs (90.91% test accuracy) and spiking neural networks (89.16%) establish performance benchmarks. The dataset's event-based format, unrestricted spatial variability and rich temporal structure makes it suitable for testing neuromorphic hardware and bio-inspired learning algorithms.

Code available at https://github.com/Kevin0304-li/llm-self-correction", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely believed to possess self-correction capabilities, yet recent studies suggest that intrinsic self-correction--where models correct their own outputs without external feedback--remains largely ineffective. In this work, we systematically decompose self-correction into three distinct sub-capabilities: error detection, error localization, and error correction. Through cross-model experiments on GSM8K-Complex (n=500 per model, 346 total errors) with three major LLMs, we uncover a striking Accuracy-Correction Paradox: weaker models (GPT-3.5, 66% accuracy) achieve 1.6x higher intrinsic correction rates than stronger models (DeepSeek, 94% accuracy)--26.8% vs 16.7%. We propose the Error Depth Hypothesis: stronger models make fewer but deeper errors that resist self-correction.

However, radiographic distinctions between early disease stages, particularly KL1 and KL2, are subtle and frequently lead to inter-observer variability among radiologists. To address these challenges, we propose VLOrdinalFormer, a vision language guided ordinal learning framework for fully automated KOA grading from knee radiographs. The proposed method combines a ViT L16 backbone with CORAL based ordinal regression and a Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) driven semantic alignment module, allowing the model to incorporate clinically meaningful textual concepts related to joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis. To improve robustness and mitigate overfitting, we employ stratified five fold cross validation, class aware re weighting to emphasize challenging intermediate grades, and test time augmentation with global threshold optimization. Experiments conducted on the publicly available OAI kneeKL224 dataset demonstrate that VLOrdinalFormer achieves state of the art performance, outperforming CNN and ViT baselines in terms of macro F1 score and overall accuracy. Notably, the proposed framework yields substantial performance gains for KL1 and KL2 without compromising classification accuracy for mild or severe cases. In addition, interpretability analyses using Grad CAM and CLIP similarity maps confirm that the model consistently attends to clinically relevant anatomical regions. These results highlight the potential of vision language aligned ordinal transformers as reliable and interpretable tools for KOA grading and disease progression assessment in routine radiological practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLOrdinalFormer\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u819d\u5173\u8282\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7ea7\uff0c\u5728KL1\u548cKL2\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02", "motivation": "\u819d\u5173\u8282\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u8981\u81f4\u6b8b\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4f46\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\uff08KL1\u548cKL2\uff09\u7684X\u5149\u7247\u5dee\u5f02\u7ec6\u5fae\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u5206\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVLOrdinalFormer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ViT L16\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u3001CORAL\u5e8f\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u548cCLIP\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u878d\u5165\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u9699\u72ed\u7a84\u3001\u9aa8\u8d58\u5f62\u6210\u7b49\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u4e94\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a", "result": "\u5728OAI kneeKL224\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5206\u6570\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eCNN\u548cViT\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cKL1\u548cKL2\u5206\u7ea7\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7b\u5ea6\u548c\u91cd\u5ea6\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u819d\u5173\u8282\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\u5206\u7ea7\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b"}}

YO integrates three complementary mechanisms in a structured two-phase architecture: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for global exploration, greedy local search for exploitation, and simulated annealing with adaptive reheating to enable controlled escape from local minima. A dedicated burn-in phase allocates evaluations to probabilistic exploration, after which a hybrid optimization loop refines promising candidates. YO further incorporates a spatial blacklist mechanism to avoid repeated evaluation of poor regions and a multi-chain execution strategy to improve robustness and reduce sensitivity to initialization.\n  We evaluate YO on three benchmarks: the Rastrigin function (5D) with ablation studies, the Traveling Salesman Problem with 50 to 200 cities, and the Rosenbrock function (5D) with comparisons against established optimizers including CMA-ES, Bayesian optimization, and accelerated particle swarm optimization. Results show that MCMC exploration and greedy refinement are critical for solution quality, while simulated annealing and multi-chain execution primarily improve stability and variance reduction.

Evidence of Systematic Underreporting in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning", "comment": "22 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables", "summary": "When AI systems explain their reasoning step-by-step, practitioners often assume these explanations reveal what actually influenced the AI's answer. We tested this assumption by embedding hints into questions and measuring whether models mentioned them. In a study of over 9,000 test cases across 11 leading AI models, we found a troubling pattern: models almost never mention hints spontaneously, yet when asked directly, they admit noticing them. This suggests models see influential information but choose not to report it. Telling models they are being watched does not help. Forcing models to report hints works, but causes them to report hints even when none exist and reduces their accuracy. We also found that hints appealing to user preferences are especially dangerous-models follow them most often while reporting them least.

However, current RL paradigms predominantly rely on random data shuffling or naive curriculum strategies based on scalar difficulty metrics. We argue that scalar metrics fail to disentangle two orthogonal challenges in video understanding: Visual Temporal Perception Load and Cognitive Reasoning Depth. To address this, we propose VideoCuRL, a novel framework that decomposes difficulty into these two axes. We employ efficient, training-free proxies, optical flow and keyframe entropy for visual complexity, Calibrated Surprisal for cognitive complexity, to map data onto a 2D curriculum grid. A competence aware Diagonal Wavefront strategy then schedules training from base alignment to complex reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce Dynamic Sparse KL and Structured Revisiting to stabilize training against reward collapse and catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that VideoCuRL surpasses strong RL baselines on reasoning (+2.5 on VSI-Bench) and perception (+2.9 on VideoMME) tasks.

This study presents a systematic comparative analysis of five widely used CNN backbones, namely VGG16, VGG19, Inception V3, ResNet50, and ResNet101, based on 245 controlled experiments combining quantitative metrics, qualitative assessment, and statistical analysis to examine the trade-off between structural preservation, stylistic behavior, and computational efficiency. The results show that backbone selection does not yield statistically significant differences in structural similarity, as confirmed by ANOVA on SSIM (p= 0.83), indicating comparable levels of structural preservation rather than equivalent stylistic quality. Within this context, ResNet-based architectures achieve approximately 5-6x faster convergence than VGG models while maintaining similar perceptual similarity (LPIPS = 0.53) and requiring over 16x fewer FLOPs (0.63 vs 10.12 GFLOPs). Qualitative analysis reveals consistent stylistic trade-offs, with VGG producing denser painterly textures, ResNet favoring geometric stability and canting stroke preservation with milder stylization, and Inception V3 exhibiting intermediate but noisier behavior. These findings reposition architectural choice in NST from maximizing stylistic intensity toward efficiency-aware and structure-preserving deployment, highlighting ResNet-based backbones as a practical foundation for scalable, industry-oriented batik generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e94\u79cdCNN\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5370\u5c3c\u8721\u67d3\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ResNet\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6bd4VGG\u9ad816\u500d\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb5-6\u500d\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8eVGG\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u5f3a\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5370\u5c3c\u8721\u67d3\u56fe\u6848\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u4fdd\u5b58\u548c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7245\u4e2a\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86VGG16\u3001VGG19\u3001Inception V3\u3001ResNet50\u548cResNet101\u4e94\u79cdCNN\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff08SSIM\u3001LPIPS\u3001FLOPs\uff09\u3001\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff08SSIM p=0.83\uff09\uff0c\u4f46ResNet\u67b6\u6784\u6bd4VGG\u6536\u655b\u5feb5-6\u500d\uff0cFLOPs\u51cf\u5c1116\u500d\uff080.63 vs 10.12 GFLOPs\uff09\uff0cLPIPS\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u76f8\u5f53\uff080.53\uff09\u3002VGG\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u7ed8\u753b\u7eb9\u7406\uff0cResNet\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7b14\u89e6\uff0cInception V3\u8868\u73b0\u5c45\u4e2d\u4f46\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u591a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e86NST\u4e2d\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ece\u6700\u5927\u5316\u98ce\u683c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8f6c\u5411\u6548\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03ResNet\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9762\u5411\u5de5\u4e1a\u7684\u8721\u67d3\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We report preliminary observations of non-Poissonian variability in inter-arrival time statistics during edge-of-stability operation, which we term the \"Silicon Heartbeat\" hypothesis. Theoretical analysis based on Hierarchical Number System (HNS) representations suggests that such architectures could achieve O(log n) energy scaling compared to traditional von Neumann O(2^n) dependencies. However, we emphasize that these are theoretical projections requiring experimental validation.

Yu"], "title": "Enhancing Temporal Awareness in LLMs for Temporal Point Processes", "comment": "preprint", "summary": "Temporal point processes (TPPs) are crucial for analyzing events over time and are widely used in fields such as finance, healthcare, and social systems. These processes are particularly valuable for understanding how events unfold over time, accounting for their irregularity and dependencies. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in sequence modeling, applying them to temporal point processes remains challenging. A key issue is that current methods struggle to effectively capture the complex interaction between temporal information and semantic context, which is vital for accurate event modeling. In this context, we introduce TPP-TAL (Temporal Point Processes with Enhanced Temporal Awareness in LLMs), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to enhance temporal reasoning within LLMs. Rather than using the conventional method of simply concatenating event time and type embeddings, TPP-TAL explicitly aligns temporal dynamics with contextual semantics before feeding this information into the LLM. This alignment allows the model to better perceive temporal dependencies and long-range interactions between events and their surrounding contexts. Through comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, it is shown that TPP-TAL delivers substantial improvements in temporal likelihood estimation and event prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance of enhancing temporal awareness in LLMs for continuous-time event modeling.

This work introduces CornViT, a three-stage Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) framework that emulates the hierarchical reasoning of human seed analysts for single-kernel evaluation. Three sequential CvT-13 classifiers operate on 384x384 RGB images: Stage 1 distinguishes pure from impure kernels; Stage 2 categorizes pure kernels into flat and round morphologies; and Stage 3 determines the embryo orientation (up vs. down) for pure, flat kernels. Starting from a public corn seed image collection, we manually relabeled and filtered images to construct three stage-specific datasets: 7265 kernels for purity, 3859 pure kernels for morphology, and 1960 pure-flat kernels for embryo orientation, all released as benchmarks. Head-only fine-tuning of ImageNet-22k pretrained CvT-13 backbones yields test accuracies of 93.76% for purity, 94.11% for shape, and 91.12% for embryo-orientation detection. Under identical training conditions, ResNet-50 reaches only 76.56 to 81.02 percent, whereas DenseNet-121 attains 86.56 to 89.38 percent accuracy. These results highlight the advantages of convolution-augmented self-attention for kernel analysis. To facilitate adoption, we deploy CornViT in a Flask-based web application that performs stage-wise inference and exposes interpretable outputs through a browser interface. Together, the CornViT framework, curated datasets, and web application provide a deployable solution for automated corn kernel quality assessment in seed quality workflows.

In this study, we explore the application of cutting-edge vision-language models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Claude 3.5) for predicting the recyclability of commonly disposed items. Utilizing a curated dataset of images, we evaluated the models' ability to match objects to appropriate recycling bins, including assessing whether the items could physically fit into the available bins. Additionally, we investigated the models' performance across several challenging scenarios: (i) adjusting predictions based on location-specific recycling guidelines; (ii) accounting for contamination or structural damage; and (iii) handling objects composed of multiple materials. Our findings highlight the significant advancements in contextual understanding offered by these models compared to previous iterations, while also identifying areas where they still fall short.

These artifacts obscure objects of interest and inflate model sizes, hindering deployment in bandwidth-constrained applications. We present Clean-GS, a method for removing background clutter and floaters from 3DGS reconstructions using sparse semantic masks. Our approach combines whitelist-based spatial filtering with color-guided validation and outlier removal to achieve 60-80\\% model compression while preserving object quality. Unlike existing 3DGS pruning methods that rely on global importance metrics, Clean-GS uses semantic information from as few as 3 segmentation masks (1\\% of views) to identify and remove Gaussians not belonging to the target object. Our multi-stage approach consisting of (1) whitelist filtering via projection to masked regions, (2) depth-buffered color validation, and (3) neighbor-based outlier removal isolates monuments and objects from complex outdoor scenes. Experiments on Tanks and Temples show that Clean-GS reduces file sizes from 125MB to 47MB while maintaining rendering quality, making 3DGS models practical for web deployment and AR/VR applications.

Instead of relying on deep convolutional architectures or extensive data augmentation, our approach extracts topological descriptors that capture intrinsic structural patterns of brain MRI, followed by feature selection to retain the most discriminative topological features. These features are then classified using an ensemble learning strategy to achieve robust multiclass discrimination.\n  Experiments conducted on the OASIS-1 MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 98.19% and an AUC of 99.75%, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art deep learning--based methods reported on OASIS and OASIS-derived datasets. Notably, the proposed framework does not require data augmentation, pretrained networks, or large-scale computational resources, making it computationally efficient and fast compared to deep neural network approaches. Furthermore, the use of topological descriptors provides greater interpretability, as the extracted features are directly linked to the underlying structural characteristics of brain MRI rather than opaque latent representations. These results indicate that TDA-Alz offers a powerful, lightweight, and interpretable alternative to deep learning models for MRI-based Alzheimer's disease severity classification, with strong potential for real-world clinical decision-support systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "TDA-Alz\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728OASIS-1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523098.19%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c99.75% AUC\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4ece\u8111MRI\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u7c7b\u9762\u4e34\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTDA-Alz\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u8111MRI\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff1b2\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u5177\u533a\u5206\u6027\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u975e\u75f4\u5446\u3001\u4e2d\u5ea6\u75f4\u5446\u3001\u8f7b\u5ea6\u3001\u6781\u8f7b\u5ea6\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728OASIS-1 MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u523098.19%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c99.75% AUC\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5339\u914d\u5728OASIS\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "TDA-Alz\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eMRI\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches rely on external critics, learned reward models, or ensemble sampling, which increases complexity and training instability. We propose Counterfactual Self-Questioning, a framework in which a single language model generates and evaluates counterfactual critiques of its own reasoning. The method produces an initial reasoning trace, formulates targeted questions that challenge potential failure points, and generates alternative reasoning trajectories that expose incorrect assumptions or invalid steps. These counterfactual trajectories provide structured relative feedback that can be directly used for policy optimization without auxiliary models. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that counterfactual self-questioning improves accuracy and training stability, particularly for smaller models, enabling scalable self-improvement using internally generated supervision alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCounterfactual Self-Questioning\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u5355\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6279\u8bc4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u8d28\u7591\u6539\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u96c6\u6210\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u81ea\u6211\u8d28\u7591\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b2) \u9488\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u5931\u8d25\u70b9\u5236\u5b9a\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3) \u751f\u6210\u66b4\u9732\u9519\u8bef\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u65e0\u6548\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b4) \u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u76f8\u5bf9\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u81ea\u6211\u8d28\u7591\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u90e8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "Counterfactual Self-Questioning\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We introduce an algorithm that computes shoppers' ``shelf visits'' -- capturing their browsing behavior in the store. Shelf visits are extracted from trajectories obtained via machine vision-based 3D tracking and overhead cameras. We perform two independent calibrations of the shelf visit algorithm, using distinct sets of trajectories (consisting of 8138 and 15129 trajectories), collected in different stores and labeled by human reviewers. The calibrated models are then evaluated on trajectories held out of the calibration process both from the same store on which calibration was performed and from the other store. An analysis of the results shows that the algorithm can recognize customers' browsing activity when evaluated in an environment different from the one on which calibration was performed. We then use the model to analyze the customers' ``browsing patterns'' on a large set of trajectories and their relation to actual purchases in the stores.

We study ICL in a linear transformer with tied weights trained on linear regression tasks, and show that minimising the in-context loss leads to a phase transition in the learned parameters. Above a critical context length, the solution develops a skew-symmetric component. We prove this by reducing the forward pass of the linear transformer under weight tying to preconditioned gradient descent, and then analysing the optimal preconditioner. This preconditioner includes a skew-symmetric component, which induces a rotation of the gradient direction. For model collapse, we use martingale and random walk theory to analyse simplified settings - linear regression and Gaussian fitting - under both replacing and cumulative data regimes. We strengthen existing results by proving almost sure convergence, showing that collapse occurs unless the data grows sufficiently fast or is retained over time. Finally, we introduce the notion of context collapse: a degradation of context during long generations, especially in chain-of-thought reasoning. This concept links the dynamics of ICL with long-term stability challenges in generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7ebf\u6027transformer\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ICL\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u5fc5\u7136\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d29\u6e83\"\u7684\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u957f\u671f\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u6743\u91cd\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027transformer\uff0c\u5206\u6790ICL\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u9785\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u62df\u5408\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1b3. \u5c06\u7ebf\u6027transformer\u7684\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u3002", "result": "1.

However, in multi-temporal satellite images, prevalent shadows exhibit significant inconsistencies due to varying illumination conditions. To address this, we propose ShadowGS, a novel framework based on 3DGS. It leverages a physics-based rendering equation from remote sensing, combined with an efficient ray marching technique, to precisely model geometrically consistent shadows while maintaining efficient rendering. Additionally, it effectively disentangles different illumination components and apparent attributes in the scene. Furthermore, we introduce a shadow consistency constraint that significantly enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D reconstruction.

However, at each hop, large language models (LLMs) retrieve subgraphs with numerous temporally similar and semantically complex relations, increasing the risk of suboptimal decisions and error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose the multi-hop reasoning enhanced (MRE) framework, which enhances both forward and backward reasoning to improve the identification of globally optimal reasoning trajectories. Specifically, MRE begins with prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating diverse reasoning trajectories for a given question. Valid reasoning trajectories are then selected for supervised fine-tuning, serving as a cold-start strategy. Finally, we introduce Tree-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO), a recursive, tree-structured learning-by-exploration approach.

In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating their potential in physics education by introducing a dedicated benchmark for explanatory video generation. The benchmark is designed to assess how well T2V models can convey core physics concepts through visual illustrations. Each physics concept in our benchmark is decomposed into granular teaching points, with each point accompanied by a carefully crafted prompt intended for visual explanation of the teaching point. T2V models are evaluated on their ability to generate accurate videos in response to these prompts. Our aim is to systematically explore the feasibility of using T2V models to generate high-quality, curriculum-aligned educational content-paving the way toward scalable, accessible, and personalized learning experiences powered by AI. Our evaluation reveals that current models produce visually coherent videos with smooth motion and minimal flickering, yet their conceptual accuracy is less reliable. Performance in areas such as mechanics, fluids, and optics is encouraging, but models struggle with electromagnetism and thermodynamics, where abstract interactions are harder to depict. These findings underscore the gap between visual quality and conceptual correctness in educational video generation. We hope this benchmark helps the community close that gap and move toward T2V systems that can deliver accurate, curriculum-aligned physics content at scale.

The advantage of RMCTS over AlphaZero's MCTS-UCB is speed. In RMCTS, the search tree is explored in a breadth-first manner, so that network inferences naturally occur in large batches. This significantly reduces the GPU latency cost. We find that RMCTS is often more than 40 times faster than MCTS-UCB when searching a single root state, and about 3 times faster when searching a large batch of root states.\n  The recursion in RMCTS is based on computing optimized posterior policies at each game state in the search tree, starting from the leaves and working back up to the root. Here we use the posterior policy explored in \"Monte--Carlo tree search as regularized policy optimization\" (Grill, et al.) Their posterior policy is the unique policy which maximizes the expected reward given estimated action rewards minus a penalty for diverging from the prior policy.\n  The tree explored by RMCTS is not defined in an adaptive manner, as it is in MCTS-UCB. Instead, the RMCTS tree is defined by following prior network policies at each node. This is a disadvantage, but the speedup advantage is more significant, and in practice we find that RMCTS-trained networks match the quality of MCTS-UCB-trained networks in roughly one-third of the training time.

This paper presents a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes AI integration across the digital twin lifecycle, spanning modeling, mirroring, intervention, and autonomous management. By synthesizing existing technologies and practices, we distill a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes how AI methodologies are embedded across the digital twin lifecycle: (1) modeling the physical twin through physics-based and physics-informed AI approaches, (2) mirroring the physical system into a digital twin with real-time synchronization, (3) intervening in the physical twin through predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and optimization strategies, and (4) achieving autonomous management through large language models, foundation models, and intelligent agents. We analyze the synergy between physics-based modeling and data-driven learning, highlighting the shift from traditional numerical solvers to physics-informed and foundation models for physical systems. Furthermore, we examine how generative AI technologies, including large language models and generative world models, transform digital twins into proactive and self-improving cognitive systems capable of reasoning, communication, and creative scenario generation. Through a cross-domain review spanning eleven application domains, including healthcare, aerospace, smart manufacturing, robotics, and smart cities, we identify common challenges related to scalability, explainability, and trustworthiness, and outline directions for responsible AI-driven digital twin systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u955c\u50cf\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5df2\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684AI\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u63cf\u8ff0AI\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606fAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u7269\u7406\u5b6a\u751f\uff1b2) \u5b9e\u65f6\u540c\u6b65\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u955c\u50cf\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5e72\u9884\u7269\u7406\u5b6a\u751f\uff1b4) \u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8de811\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7efc\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684AI-\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5411\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u521b\u9020\u6027\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u6280\u672f\u6b63\u5728\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u671d\u7740\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

To address these problems, we introduce JiSi, a novel framework designed to release the full potential of LLMs' collaboration through three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing capturing both semantic information and problem difficulty; (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection jointly evaluating the aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators; (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch dynamically leveraging the advantages of routing and aggregation.

Rather than relying on inefficient standard im2col-like implementations (e.g., spatial convolutions, depthwise convolutions and feature-shifting mechanisms) or hardware-specific CUDA kernels (e.g., deformable and neighborhood attention), which often suffer from limited portability across non-CUDA devices, we reorganize the local sampling process through a direction-based sampling perspective. Specifically, we implement a non-parametric sampling mechanism that enables dynamically varying sampling regions. This approach provides the flexibility to adapt to diverse spatial structures without the computational costs of parametric layers and the need for model retraining. To further enhance feature coherence across frames, we design a supervised spatio-temporal contrastive learning scheme that enforces consistency in feature representations. In addition, we introduce a publicly available benchmark dataset for multi-object segmentation in X-ray angiography videos (MOSXAV), featuring detailed, manually labeled segmentation ground truth. Extensive experiments on the CADICA, XACV, and MOSXAV datasets show that our proposed FSVOS method outperforms current state-of-the-art video segmentation methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and generalization capability (i.e., seen and unseen categories).

While AI models have achieved notable success across various scientific domains, they typically remain domain-specific or lack the capability of simultaneously understanding and generating multimodal scientific data, particularly for high-dimensional data. Yet, many pressing global challenges and scientific problems are inherently cross-disciplinary and require coordinated progress across multiple fields. Here, we present FuXi-Uni, a native unified multimodal model for scientific understanding and high-fidelity generation across scientific domains within a single architecture. Specifically, FuXi-Uni aligns cross-disciplinary scientific tokens within natural language tokens and employs science decoder to reconstruct scientific tokens, thereby supporting both natural language conversation and scientific numerical prediction. Empirically, we validate FuXi-Uni in Earth science and Biomedicine. In Earth system modeling, the model supports global weather forecasting, tropical cyclone (TC) forecast editing, and spatial downscaling driven by only language instructions. FuXi-Uni generates 10-day global forecasts at 0.25\u00b0 resolution that outperform the SOTA physical forecasting system. It shows superior performance for both TC track and intensity prediction relative to the SOTA physical model, and generates high-resolution regional weather fields that surpass standard interpolation baselines. Regarding biomedicine, FuXi-Uni outperforms leading multimodal large language models on multiple biomedical visual question answering benchmarks. By unifying heterogeneous scientific modalities within a native shared latent space while maintaining strong domain-specific performance, FuXi-Uni provides a step forward more general-purpose, multimodal scientific models.", "AI": {"tldr": "FuXi-Uni\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u7403\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u540c\u65f6\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u8bb8\u591a\u5168\u7403\u6027\u6311\u6218\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u534f\u8c03\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u9ad8\u7ef4\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "FuXi-Uni\u5c06\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u79d1\u5b66\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u79d1\u5b66\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u5efa\u79d1\u5b66\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5730\u7403\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\uff1a10\u5929\u5168\u7403\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\uff080.25\u00b0\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u7269\u7406\u9884\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u65cb\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7a7a\u95f4\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u533a\u57df\u5929\u6c14\u573a\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6\u63d2\u503c\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\uff1a\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "FuXi-Uni\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u539f\u751f\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u5f02\u6784\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmark frameworks still exhibit notable deficiencies in supporting cross-platform tasks in educational contexts, especially when dealing with school-specific software (such as XiaoYa Intelligent Assistant, HuaShi XiaZi, etc.), where the efficiency of agents often significantly decreases due to a lack of understanding of the structural specifics of these private-domain software. Additionally, current evaluation methods heavily rely on coarse-grained metrics like goal orientation or trajectory matching, making it challenging to capture the detailed execution and efficiency of agents in complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose KGCE (Knowledge-Augmented Dual-Graph Evaluator for Cross-Platform Educational Agent Benchmarking with Multimodal Language Models), a novel benchmarking platform that integrates knowledge base enhancement and a dual-graph evaluation framework. We first constructed a dataset comprising 104 education-related tasks, covering Windows, Android, and cross-platform collaborative tasks. KGCE introduces a dual-graph evaluation framework that decomposes tasks into multiple sub-goals and verifies their completion status, providing fine-grained evaluation metrics. To overcome the execution bottlenecks of existing agents in private-domain tasks, we developed an enhanced agent system incorporating a knowledge base specific to school-specific software.

Santamaria", "Claudia Isaza", "Jhony H. Giraldo"], "title": "WildIng: A Wildlife Image Invariant Representation Model for Geographical Domain Shift", "comment": null, "summary": "Wildlife monitoring is crucial for studying biodiversity loss and climate change. Camera trap images provide a non-intrusive method for analyzing animal populations and identifying ecological patterns over time. However, manual analysis is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Deep learning, particularly foundation models, has been applied to automate wildlife identification, achieving strong performance when tested on data from the same geographical locations as their training sets. Yet, despite their promise, these models struggle to generalize to new geographical areas, leading to significant performance drops. For example, training an advanced vision-language model, such as CLIP with an adapter, on an African dataset achieves an accuracy of 84.77%. However, this performance drops significantly to 16.17% when the model is tested on an American dataset. This limitation partly arises because existing models rely predominantly on image-based representations, making them sensitive to geographical data distribution shifts, such as variation in background, lighting, and environmental conditions. To address this, we introduce WildIng, a Wildlife image Invariant representation model for geographical domain shift. WildIng integrates text descriptions with image features, creating a more robust representation to geographical domain shifts. By leveraging textual descriptions, our approach captures consistent semantic information, such as detailed descriptions of the appearance of the species, improving generalization across different geographical locations. Experiments show that WildIng enhances the accuracy of foundation models such as BioCLIP by 30% under geographical domain shift conditions. We evaluate WildIng on two datasets collected from different regions, namely America and Africa.

However, compared with large language models, SLMs are more prone to factual hallucinations in reasoning and exhibit weaker classification performance. This raises a natural question: Can mitigating factual hallucinations improve SLMs' financial classification? To address this, we propose a three-step pipeline named AAAI (Association Identification, Automated Detection, and Adaptive Inference). Experiments on three representative SLMs reveal that: (1) factual hallucinations are positively correlated with misclassifications; (2) encoder-based verifiers effectively detect factual hallucinations; and (3) incorporating feedback on factual errors enables SLMs' adaptive inference that enhances classification performance.

However, existing RS VG datasets predominantly rely on explicit referring expressions-such as relative position, relative size, and color cues-thereby constraining performance on implicit VG tasks that require scenario-specific domain knowledge. This article introduces DVGBench, a high-quality implicit VG benchmark for drones, covering six major application scenarios: traffic, disaster, security, sport, social activity, and productive activity. Each object provides both explicit and implicit queries. Based on the dataset, we design DroneVG-R1, an LVLM that integrates the novel Implicit-to-Explicit Chain-of-Thought (I2E-CoT) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. This enables the model to take advantage of scene-specific expertise, converting implicit references into explicit ones and thus reducing grounding difficulty.

While traditional econometric methods struggle when these confounders are orthogonal to structured covariates, high-dimensional unstructured text often contains rich proxies for these latent variables. This study proposes a Neural Network-Enhanced Double Machine Learning (DML) framework designed to leverage text embeddings for causal identification. Using a rigorous synthetic benchmark, we demonstrate that unstructured text embeddings capture critical confounding information that is absent from structured tabular data. However, we show that standard tree-based DML estimators retain substantial bias (+24%) due to their inability to model the continuous topology of embedding manifolds. In contrast, our deep learning approach reduces bias to -0.86% with optimized architectures, effectively recovering the ground-truth causal parameter.

In particular, the high dynamic range and motion-sensitive nature of event cameras are often overlooked, while low-information regions are processed uniformly, leading to unnecessary computational overhead for the backbone network. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework that performs early fusion in the frequency domain, enabling effective aggregation of high-frequency information from the event modality. Specifically, RGB and event modalities are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain via the Fast Fourier Transform, with their amplitude and phase components decoupled. High-frequency event information is selectively fused into RGB modality through amplitude and phase attention, enhancing feature representation while substantially reducing backbone computation. In addition, a motion-guided spatial sparsification module leverages the motion-sensitive nature of event cameras to capture the relationship between target motion cues and spatial probability distribution, filtering out low-information regions and enhancing target-relevant features. Finally, a sparse set of target-relevant features is fed into the backbone network for learning, and the tracking head predicts the final target position. Extensive experiments on three widely used RGB-Event tracking benchmark datasets, including FE108, FELT, and COESOT, demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of our method.

The dominant design queries a single LLM for a posterior over states, thresholds \"confidence,\" and acts; we prove this is inadequate for sequential decisions with costs. We propose a Bayesian, cost-aware multi-LLM orchestration framework that treats LLMs as approximate likelihood models rather than classifiers. For each candidate state, we elicit likelihoods via contrastive prompting, aggregate across diverse models with robust statistics, and update beliefs with Bayes rule under explicit priors as new evidence arrives. This enables coherent belief updating, expected-cost action selection, principled information gathering via value of information, and fairness gains via ensemble bias mitigation. In resume screening with costs of 40000 USD per missed hire, 2500 USD per interview, and 150 USD per phone screen, experiments on 1000 resumes using five LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro, Grok, DeepSeek) reduce total cost by 294000 USD (34 percent) versus the best single-LLM baseline and improve demographic parity by 45 percent (max group gap 22 to 5 percentage points).

Previous methods address these challenges through local alignment, yet they are often prone to shortcut learning and spurious correlations, yielding misalignment. Moreover, injecting prior knowledge can distort intra-modality structure. Motivated by our finding that encoder attention surfaces spatially precise evidence from the earliest training epochs, and to alleviate these issues, we introduceITSELF, an attention-guided framework for implicit local alignment. At its core, Guided Representation with Attentive Bank (GRAB) converts the model's own attention into an Attentive Bank of high-saliency tokens and applies local objectives on this bank, learning fine-grained correspondences without extra supervision. To make the selection reliable and non-redundant, we introduce Multi-Layer Attention for Robust Selection (MARS), which aggregates attention across layers and performs diversity-aware top-k selection; and Adaptive Token Scheduler (ATS), which schedules the retention budget from coarse to fine over training, preserving context early while progressively focusing on discriminative details. Extensive experiments on three widely used TBPS benchmarks showstate-of-the-art performance and strong cross-dataset generalization, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of our approach without additional prior supervision.

To validate this methodology without relying on opaque private data, we implement a Synthetic Proxy Protocol. Our preliminary pilot study on 2025 baselines (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1) suggests that while reasoning models act as a \"cognitive buffer,\" they may exhibit \"Defensive OverThinking\" under adversarial pressure.

We propose a two-stage framework for improving behavioral alignment. The first stage, context formation, explicitly specifies the experimental design to establish an accurate representation of the decision task and its context. The second stage, context navigation, guides the reasoning process within that representation to make decisions. We validate this framework through a focal replication of a sequential purchasing game with quality signaling (Kremer and Debo, 2016), extending to a crowdfunding game with costly signaling (Cason et al., 2025) and a demand-estimation task (Gui and Toubia, 2025) to test generalizability across decision environments. Across four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-4.0-Sonnet-Thinking, DeepSeek-R1), we find that complex decision-making environments require both stages to achieve behavioral alignment with human benchmarks, whereas the simpler demand-estimation task requires only context formation.

This exclusion arises from the inherent ill-posed nature of 3D estimation from monocular image, which introduces instability during training. Consequently, high-quality 3D predictions can be erroneously suppressed by 2D-only matching criteria, leading to suboptimal results. To address this, we propose Mono3DV, a novel Transformer-based framework. Our approach introduces three key innovations. First, we develop a 3D-Aware Bipartite Matching strategy that directly incorporates 3D geometric information into the matching cost, resolving the misalignment caused by purely 2D criteria. Second, it is important to stabilize the Bipartite Matching to resolve the instability occurring when integrating 3D attributes. Therefore, we propose 3D-DeNoising scheme in the training phase. Finally, recognizing the gradient vanishing issue associated with conventional denoising techniques, we propose a novel Variational Query DeNoising mechanism to overcome this limitation, which significantly enhances model performance.

The root cause lies in the high diversity of artifact distributions introduced by different forgery methods, while pretrained models tend to disrupt their original general semantic structures when adapting to new artifacts. Existing approaches usually rely on indiscriminate global parameter updates or introduce additional supervision signals, making it difficult to effectively model diverse forgery artifacts while preserving semantic stability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a deepfake detection method based on Multi-Artifact Subspaces and selective layer masks (MASM), which explicitly decouples semantic representations from artifact representations and constrains the fitting strength of artifact subspaces, thereby improving generalization robustness in cross-dataset scenarios. Specifically, MASM applies singular value decomposition to model weights, partitioning pretrained weights into a stable semantic principal subspace and multiple learnable artifact subspaces. This design enables decoupled modeling of different forgery artifact patterns while preserving the general semantic subspace. On this basis, a selective layer mask strategy is introduced to adaptively regulate the update behavior of corresponding network layers according to the learning state of each artifact subspace, suppressing overfitting to any single forgery characteristic. Furthermore, orthogonality constraints and spectral consistency constraints are imposed to jointly regularize multiple artifact subspaces, guiding them to learn complementary and diverse artifact representations while maintaining a stable overall spectral structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMASM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4f2a\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u4e0d\u540c\u4f2a\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u5206\u5e03\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u4f2a\u5f71\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u7834\u574f\u539f\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u6216\u989d\u5916\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4f2a\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u63a9\u7801\u7684MASM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5404\u4f2a\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u72b6\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u5bf9\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b3) \u65bd\u52a0\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f7f\u591a\u4e2a\u4f2a\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e92\u8865\u591a\u6837\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u4f2a\u5f71\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u62df\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MASM\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u8868\u793a\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u66f4\u65b0\u8c03\u8282\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches rely on procedural JSON-based function calling, which often struggles with long-horizon tasks due to fragile multi-turn dependencies and context drift. In this paper, we present CaveAgent, a framework that transforms the paradigm from \"LLM-as-Text-Generator\" to \"LLM-as-Runtime-Operator.\" We introduce a Dual-stream Context Architecture that decouples state management into a lightweight semantic stream for reasoning and a persistent, deterministic Python Runtime stream for execution. In addition to leveraging code generation to efficiently resolve interdependent sub-tasks (e.g., loops, conditionals) in a single step, we introduce \\textit{Stateful Runtime Management} in CaveAgent. Distinct from existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound and lack the support for external object injection and retrieval, CaveAgent injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns. This persistence mechanism acts as a high-fidelity external memory to eliminate context drift, avoid catastrophic forgetting, while ensuring that processed data flows losslessly to downstream applications. Comprehensive evaluations on Tau$^2$-bench, BFCL and various case studies across representative SOTA LLMs demonstrate CaveAgent's superiority. Specifically, our framework achieves a 10.5\\% success rate improvement on retail tasks and reduces total token consumption by 28.4\\% in multi-turn scenarios. On data-intensive tasks, direct variable storage and retrieval reduces token consumption by 59\\%, allowing CaveAgent to handle large-scale data that causes context overflow failures in both JSON-based and Code-based agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "CaveAgent\u6846\u67b6\u5c06LLM\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u79bb\u72b6\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742Python\u5bf9\u8c61\u6301\u4e45\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56JSON\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u5904\u7406\u957f\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCaveAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6d41\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u786e\u5b9a\u6027Python\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6d41\u7528\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u5316\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742Python\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u6ce8\u5165\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u8de8\u8f6e\u6b21\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728Tau\u00b2-bench\u3001BFCL\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCaveAgent\u5728\u96f6\u552e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u534710.5%\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u573a\u666f\u603btoken\u6d88\u8017\u51cf\u5c1128.4%\u3002\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u53d8\u91cf\u5b58\u50a8\u51cf\u5c1159% token\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u4ed6\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ea2\u51fa\u7684\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "CaveAgent\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06LLM\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although transfer learning is commonly used for predicting body weight from images, its effectiveness and optimal fine-tuning strategies remain poorly understood in livestock applications, particularly beyond the use of pretrained ImageNet or COCO weights. In addition, while both depth images and three-dimensional point-cloud data have been explored for body weight prediction, direct comparisons of these two modalities in dairy cattle are limited. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate whether transfer learning from a large farm enhances body weight prediction on a small farm with limited data, and 2) compare the predictive performance of depth-image- and point-cloud-based approaches under three experimental designs. Top-view depth images and point-cloud data were collected from 1,201, 215, and 58 cows at large, medium, and small dairy farms, respectively. Four deep learning models were evaluated: ConvNeXt and MobileViT for depth images, and PointNet and DGCNN for point clouds. Transfer learning markedly improved body weight prediction on the small farm across all four models, outperforming single-source learning and achieving gains comparable to or greater than joint learning. These results indicate that pretrained representations generalize well across farms with differing imaging conditions and dairy cattle populations. No consistent performance difference was observed between depth-image- and point-cloud-based models. Overall, these findings suggest that transfer learning is well suited for small farm prediction scenarios where cross-farm data sharing is limited by privacy, logistical, or policy constraints, as it requires access only to pretrained model weights rather than raw data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5976\u725b\u4f53\u91cd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u4e24\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u519c\u573a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e3a\u5976\u725b\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u755c\u7267\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e14\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5976\u725b\u4f53\u91cd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5927\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u5c0f\u4e09\u4e2a\u519c\u573a\u5206\u522b\u6536\u96c6\u4e861,201\u3001215\u548c58\u5934\u5976\u725b\u7684\u4fef\u89c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff1aConvNeXt\u548cMobileViT\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\uff0cPointNet\u548cDGCNN\u7528\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5355\u6e90\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u519c\u573a\u7684\u4f53\u91cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6e90\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5976\u725b\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5c0f\u519c\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8de8\u519c\u573a\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u7269\u6d41\u6216\u653f\u7b56\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Applying rules to such inputs demands both interpretive flexibility and formal guarantees. Large language models (LLMs) provide flexibility but cannot ensure consistent rule application; symbolic systems provide guarantees but require structured input. This paper presents an integration pattern that combines these strengths: LLMs serve as ontology population engines, translating unstructured text into ABox assertions according to expert-authored TBox specifications, while SWRL-based reasoners apply rules with deterministic guarantees. The framework decomposes reasoning into entity identification, assertion extraction, and symbolic verification, with task definitions grounded in OWL 2 ontologies. Experiments across three domains (legal hearsay determination, scientific method-task application, clinical trial eligibility) and eleven language models validate the approach. Structured decomposition achieves statistically significant improvements over few-shot prompting in aggregate, with gains observed across all three domains. An ablation study confirms that symbolic verification provides substantial benefit beyond structured prompting alone. The populated ABox integrates with standard semantic web tooling for inspection and querying, positioning the framework for richer inference patterns that simpler formalisms cannot express.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1aLLM\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aABox\u65ad\u8a00\uff0cSWRL\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89c4\u5219\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u4e34\u5e8a\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8bc1\u636e\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u6807\u51c6\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1aLLM\u7075\u6d3b\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1aLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672c\u4f53\u586b\u5145\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aABox\u65ad\u8a00\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f16\u5199\u7684TBox\u89c4\u8303\uff09\uff0cSWRL\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89c4\u5219\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u65ad\u8a00\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f20\u95fb\u8bc1\u636e\u5224\u5b9a\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8d44\u683c\uff09\u548c11\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u76f8\u6bd4few-shot\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u8ba4\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6bd4\u5355\u7eaf\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u6709\u5b9e\u8d28\u597d\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86LLM\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u586b\u5145\u7684ABox\u53ef\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u4e49\u7f51\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Accurate W-HOI reconstruction is critical for understanding human behavior and enabling applications in embodied intelligence and virtual reality. However, existing hand-object interactions (HOI) methods are limited to single images or camera coordinates, failing to model temporal dynamics or consistent global trajectories. Some recent approaches attempt world-space hand estimation but overlook object poses and HOI constraints. Their performance also suffers under severe camera motion and frequent occlusions common in egocentric in-the-wild videos. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-stage framework with a robust pre-process pipeline built on newly developed spatial intelligence models, a whole-body HOI prior model based on decoupled diffusion models, and a multi-objective test-time optimization paradigm. Our HOI prior model is template-free and scalable to multiple objects. In experiments, we prove our method achieving state-of-the-art performance in W-HOI reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "EgoGrasp\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u4ece\u52a8\u6001\u5355\u76ee\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u4e16\u754c\u7a7a\u95f4\u624b\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u7a7a\u95f4\u624b\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u91cd\u5efa\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u76f8\u673a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6216\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u906e\u6321\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u8026\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u624b\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u65e0\u6a21\u677f\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u7269\u4f53\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u7a7a\u95f4\u624b\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EgoGrasp\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ece\u52a8\u6001\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u4e16\u754c\u7a7a\u95f4\u624b\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This study evaluates the classification performance of machine learning and deep learning models on the LC25000 dataset, which includes five classes of histopathological images. We used the fine-tuned InceptionResNet-v2 network both as a classifier and for feature extraction. Our results show that the fine-tuned InceptionResNet-v2 achieved a classification accuracy of 96.01\\% and an average AUC of 96.8\\%.

However, efficiently reconstructing hyperspectral images from compressive sensing measurements presents significant challenges. To tackle these, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy that capitalizes on the unique spectral and spatial characteristics of hyperspectral images. We introduce the Lightweight Separate Spectral Transformer (LSST), an innovative architecture tailored for efficient hyperspectral image reconstruction. This architecture consists of Separate Spectral Transformer Blocks (SSTB) for modeling spectral relationships and Lightweight Spatial Convolution Blocks (LSCB) for spatial processing. The SSTB employs Grouped Spectral Self-attention and a Spectrum Shuffle operation to effectively manage both local and non-local spectral relationships. Simultaneously, the LSCB utilizes depth-wise separable convolutions and strategic ordering to enhance spatial information processing. Furthermore, we implement the Focal Spectrum Loss, a novel loss weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts during training to improve reconstruction across spectrally complex bands. Extensive testing demonstrates that our LSST achieves superior performance while requiring fewer FLOPs and parameters, underscoring its efficiency and effectiveness.

Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for generating Register Transfer Level (RTL) code, but existing benchmarks mainly evaluate syntactic correctness rather than optimization quality in terms of power, performance, and area (PPA). This work introduces RTL-OPT, a benchmark for assessing the capability of LLMs in RTL optimization. RTL-OPT contains 36 handcrafted digital designs that cover diverse implementation categories including combinational logic, pipelined datapaths, finite state machines, and memory interfaces. Each task provides a pair of RTL codes, a suboptimal version and a human-optimized reference that reflects industry-proven optimization patterns not captured by conventional synthesis tools.

Testing six state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Flash, Gemini-2.5-Lite, Claude-Sonnet-4.5, Claude-Opus-4.5) on 100 problems spanning seven engineering domains, we compare direct prediction against solver-assisted computation where LLMs formulate governing equations and provide initial conditions while Newton-Raphson iteration performs numerical solution. Direct prediction yields mean relative errors of 0.765 to 1.262 across models, while solver-assisted computation achieves 0.225 to 0.301, representing error reductions of 67.9% to 81.8%. Domain-specific analysis reveals dramatic improvements in Electronics (93.1%) due to exponential equation sensitivity, contrasted with modest gains in Fluid Mechanics (7.2%) where LLMs exhibit effective pattern recognition.

Our approach is built upon a novel watermark definition that leverages patch-level luminance statistics. Specifically, the service provider predefines a binary pattern together with corresponding patch-level thresholds. To detect a watermark in a given image, we evaluate whether the luminance of each patch surpasses its threshold and then verify whether the resulting binary pattern aligns with the target one. A simple statistical analysis demonstrates that the false positive rate of the proposed method can be effectively controlled, thereby ensuring certified detection. To enable seamless watermark injection across different paradigms, we leverage the widely adopted guidance technique as a plug-and-play mechanism and develop the \\emph{watermark guidance}. This design enables Luminark to achieve generality across state-of-the-art generative models without compromising image quality. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on nine models spanning diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid frameworks.

We propose a multi-session benchmark (spanning 6-10 sessions across three distinct stages) that demands critical capabilities such as memory continuity, adaptive reasoning, and longitudinal planning. The dataset is annotated with extensive professional skills, comprising over 677 meta-skills and 4577 atomic skills. \\textbf{2) How to train a multi-therapy AI counselor?} While existing models often focus on a single therapy, complex cases frequently require flexible strategies among various therapies. We construct a diverse dataset covering five therapeutic modalities (Psychodynamic, Behaviorism, CBT, Humanistic Existentialist, and Postmodernist) alongside an integrative therapy with a unified three-stage clinical framework across six core psychological topics. \\textbf{3) How to systematically evaluate an AI counselor?} We establish a holistic evaluation framework with 18 therapy-specific and therapy-shared metrics across Client-Level and Counselor-Level dimensions. To support this, we also construct over 2,000 diverse client profiles. Extensive experimental analysis fully validates the superior quality and clinical fidelity of our dataset.

Decision-theoretic alignment under uncertainty", "summary": "This paper introduces Admissibility Alignment: a reframing of AI alignment as a property of admissible action and decision selection over distributions of outcomes under uncertainty, evaluated through the behavior of candidate policies. We present MAP-AI (Monte Carlo Alignment for Policy) as a canonical system architecture for operationalizing admissibility alignment, formalizing alignment as a probabilistic, decision-theoretic property rather than a static or binary condition.\n  MAP-AI, a new control-plane system architecture for aligned decision-making under uncertainty, enforces alignment through Monte Carlo estimation of outcome distributions and admissibility-controlled policy selection rather than static model-level constraints. The framework evaluates decision policies across ensembles of plausible futures, explicitly modeling uncertainty, intervention effects, value ambiguity, and governance constraints. Alignment is assessed through distributional properties including expected utility, variance, tail risk, and probability of misalignment rather than accuracy or ranking performance. This approach distinguishes probabilistic prediction from decision reasoning under uncertainty and provides an executable methodology for evaluating trust and alignment in enterprise and institutional AI systems. The result is a practical foundation for governing AI systems whose impact is determined not by individual forecasts, but by policy behavior across distributions and tail events. Finally, we show how distributional alignment evaluation can be integrated into decision-making itself, yielding an admissibility-controlled action selection mechanism that alters policy behavior under uncertainty without retraining or modifying underlying models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\"\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u5bf9\u9f50\"\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u884c\u52a8\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u9009\u62e9\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4ecb\u7ecdMAP-AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u9009\u62e9\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u6216\u4e8c\u5143\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u7684\u8003\u8651\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u6027\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9645\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMAP-AI\uff08\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u5bf9\u9f50\u653f\u7b56\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u63a7\u5236\u653f\u7b56\u9009\u62e9\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u51b3\u7b56\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u672a\u6765\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6cbb\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u662f\u7531\u4e2a\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7531\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u6574\u5408\u5230\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u63a7\u5236\u884c\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u63a8\u7406\u533a\u5206\u5f00\u6765\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

True narrative understanding requires grounding who is doing what, when, and where, maintaining coherent entity representations across dynamic visual and temporal contexts. We introduce NarrativeTrack, the first benchmark to evaluate narrative understanding in MLLMs through fine-grained entity-centric reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks limited to short clips or coarse scene-level semantics, we decompose videos into constituent entities and examine their continuity via a Compositional Reasoning Progression (CRP), a structured evaluation framework that progressively increases narrative complexity across three dimensions: entity existence, entity changes, and entity ambiguity. CRP challenges models to advance from temporal persistence to contextual evolution and fine-grained perceptual reasoning. A fully automated entity-centric pipeline enables scalable extraction of temporally grounded entity representations, providing the foundation for CRP. Evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that models fail to robustly track entities across visual transitions and temporal dynamics, often hallucinating identity under context shifts. Open-source general-purpose MLLMs exhibit strong perceptual grounding but weak temporal coherence, while video-specific MLLMs capture temporal context yet hallucinate entity's contexts. These findings uncover a fundamental trade-off between perceptual grounding and temporal reasoning, indicating that narrative understanding emerges only from their integration. NarrativeTrack provides the first systematic framework to diagnose and advance temporally grounded narrative comprehension in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NarrativeTrack\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u53d9\u4e8b\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9e\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u53d9\u4e8b\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\"\u8c01\u5728\u4f55\u65f6\u4f55\u5730\u505a\u4ec0\u4e48\"\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9e\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNarrativeTrack\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u53d9\u4e8b\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1a\u5b9e\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u6b67\u4e49\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u5b9e\u4f53\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u5230\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684MLLM\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u7a33\u5065\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u8eab\u4efd\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u5f00\u6e90\u901a\u7528MLLM\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u4f46\u5f31\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u9891\u4e13\u7528MLLM\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f46\u4ea7\u751f\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u53d9\u4e8b\u7406\u89e3\u53ea\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u6574\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002NarrativeTrack\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u63a8\u8fdbMLLM\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

The datasets span binary classification, fine-grained multiclass recognition, and object detection scenarios. We analyze how architectural factors, such as network depth, residual connections, and feature extraction strategies, influence classification and localization performance. The results show that deeper CNN architectures provide substantial performance gains on fine-grained multiclass datasets, while lightweight pretrained and transfer learning models remain highly effective for simpler binary classification tasks. Additionally, we extend the proposed architecture to an object detection setting, demonstrating its adaptability in identifying unauthorized auto-rickshaws in real-world traffic scenes.

However, existing approaches often rely on structured inputs and lack robust validation of factual accuracy and semantic consistency, limitations that are especially problematic in oncology. We introduce an end-to-end framework for clinical KG construction and evaluation directly from free text using multi-agent prompting and a schema-constrained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) strategy. Our pipeline integrates (1) prompt-driven entity, attribute, and relation extraction; (2) entropy-based uncertainty scoring; (3) ontology-aligned RDF/OWL schema generation; and (4) multi-LLM consensus validation for hallucination detection and semantic refinement. Beyond static graph construction, the framework supports continuous refinement and self-supervised evaluation, enabling iterative improvement of graph quality. Applied to two oncology cohorts (PDAC and BRCA), our method produces interpretable, SPARQL-compatible, and clinically grounded knowledge graphs without relying on gold-standard annotations.

The proposed model introduces (i) a combined loss term aligning the global color statistics through differentiable histogram matching, perceptual image quality measure, and feature based similarity to preserve texture information, (ii) local hue-saturation priors injected via Spatially Adaptive Denormalization (SPADE) to stabilize chromatic reconstruction, and (iii) texture-aware supervision within a Mamba backbone to preserve fine details. We introduce an adaptive-resolution inference engine that further enables high-resolution translation without sacrificing quality. Our proposed NIR-to-RGB translation model simultaneously enforces global color statistics and local chromatic consistency, while scaling to native resolutions without compromising texture fidelity or generalization. Extensive evaluations on FANVID, OMSIV, VCIP2020, and RGB2NIR using different evaluation metrics demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baseline methods. HAQAGen produces images with sharper textures, natural colors, attaining significant gains as per perceptual metrics. These results position HAQAGen as a scalable and effective solution for NIR-to-RGB translation across diverse imaging scenarios.

Although prior studies have advanced the overall design of LLM-based agents, systematic optimization of their internal reasoning and tool-use pipelines remains underexplored. This paper introduces an agent framework grounded in real-world practical experience, with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive prompt generation strategy that aligns with the agent's state and task goals to improve reliability and robustness; (2) a context-aware tool orchestration module that performs tool categorization, semantic retrieval, and adaptive invocation based on user intent and context; and (3) a layered memory mechanism that integrates session memory, task history, and external summaries to improve relevance and efficiency through dynamic summarization and compression. An end-to-end framework named Jenius-Agent has been integrated with three key optimizations, including tools based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), file input/output (I/O), and execution feedback. The experiments show a 20 percent improvement in task accuracy, along with a reduced token cost, response latency, and invocation failures.

Current coordinate-guided low-resolution feature interpolation methods, e.g., bilinear interpolation, produce coarse high-resolution features which suffer from feature misalignment and insufficient context information. Moreover, enriching semantics to high-resolution features requires a high computation burden, so that it is challenging to meet the requirement of lowlatency inference. We propose a novel Guided Attentive Interpolation (GAI) method to adaptively interpolate fine-grained high-resolution features with semantic features to tackle these issues. Guided Attentive Interpolation determines both spatial and semantic relations of pixels from features of different resolutions and then leverages these relations to interpolate high-resolution features with rich semantics. GAI can be integrated with any deep convolutional network for efficient semantic segmentation. In experiments, the GAI-based semantic segmentation networks, i.e., GAIN, can achieve78.8 mIoU with 22.3 FPS on Cityscapes and 80.6 mIoU with 64.5 on CamVid using an NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU, which are the new state-of-the-art results of low-latency semantic segmentation.

Current echocardiography-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) models focus primarily on binary HFpEF detection in humans and do not provide comorbidity-specific phenotyping or temporal estimates of disease progression towards decompensation. We aimed to develop a unified AI framework, CardioMOD-Net, to perform multiclass diagnosis and continuous prediction of HFpEF onset directly from standard echocardiography cine loops in preclinical models.\n  Methods: Mouse echocardiography videos from four groups were used: control (CTL), hyperglycaemic (HG), obesity (OB), and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH). Two-dimensional parasternal long-axis cine loops were decomposed using Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) to extract temporal features for downstream analysis. A shared latent representation supported Vision Transformers, one for a classifier for diagnosis and another for a regression module for predicting the age at HFpEF onset.\n  Results: Overall diagnostic accuracy across the four groups was 65%, with all classes exceeding 50% accuracy. Misclassifications primarily reflected early-stage overlap between OB or SAH and CTL. The prognostic module achieved a root-mean-square error of 21.72 weeks for time-to-HFpEF prediction, with OB and SAH showing the most accurate estimates. Predicted HFpEF onset closely matched true distributions in all groups.\n  Discussion: This unified framework demonstrates that multiclass phenotyping and continuous HFpEF onset prediction can be obtained from a single cine loop, even under small-data conditions.

Prior work has attributed this evaluation-deployment gap to problems of measurement and validity. While these critiques are insightful, we argue that they overlook a more fundamental issue: many socio-cognitive evaluations proceed without an explicit theoretical specification of the target capability, leaving the assumptions linking task performance to competence implicit. Without this theoretical grounding, benchmarks that exercise only narrow subsets of a capability are routinely misinterpreted as evidence of broad competence: a gap that creates a systemic validity illusion by masking the failure to evaluate the capability's other essential dimensions. To address this gap, we make two contributions. First, we diagnose and formalize this theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results. Second, we introduce the Theory Trace Card (TTC), a lightweight documentation artifact designed to accompany socio-cognitive evaluations, which explicitly outlines the theoretical basis of an evaluation, the components of the target capability it exercises, its operationalization, and its limitations. We argue that TTCs enhance the interpretability and reuse of socio-cognitive evaluations by making explicit the full validity chain, which links theory, task operationalization, scoring, and limitations, without modifying benchmarks or requiring agreement on a single theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u88ab\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5361(TTC)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u660e\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u867d\u7136\u5f97\u5206\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u66f4\u6839\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8fc7\u5ea6\u89e3\u8bfb\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bca\u65ad\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\"\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u53e3\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u30022. \u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5361(TTC)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6587\u6863\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u660e\u786e\u8bb0\u5f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u529b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "TTC\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6216\u8981\u6c42\u7406\u8bba\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u7406\u8bba-\u4efb\u52a1\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316-\u8bc4\u5206-\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6548\u5ea6\u94fe\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u6765\u907f\u514d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6548\u5ea6\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002TTC\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u53e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u52a0\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u3002"}}

While classical A* is valued for its optimality, it incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs in large-scale scenarios. Recent attempts to mitigate these limitations by using Large Language Models for waypoint guidance remain insufficient, as they rely only on text-based reasoning without spatial grounding. As a result, such models often produce incorrect waypoints in topologically complex environments with dead ends, and lack the perceptual capacity to interpret ambiguous physical boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to costly corrective expansions and undermine the intended computational efficiency.\n  We introduce MMP-A*, a multimodal framework that integrates the spatial grounding capabilities of vision-language models with a novel adaptive decay mechanism. By anchoring high-level reasoning in physical geometry, the framework produces coherent waypoint guidance that addresses the limitations of text-only planners.

It extends Video Crowd Counting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that learns to count pedestrians across frames, VIC must identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which turns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however, can underperform in congested scenes such as metro commuting. To address this, we build WuhanMetroCrowd, one of the first VIC datasets that characterize crowded, dynamic pedestrian flows. It features sparse-to-dense density levels, short-to-long video clips, slow-to-fast flow variations, front-to-back appearance changes, and light-to-heavy occlusions. To better adapt VIC approaches to crowds, we rethink the nature of VIC and recognize two informative priors: i) the social grouping prior that indicates pedestrians tend to gather in groups and ii) the spatial-temporal displacement prior that informs an individual cannot teleport physically. The former inspires us to relax the standard one-to-one (O2O) matching used by VIC to one-to-many (O2M) matching, implemented by an implicit context generator and a O2M matcher; the latter facilitates the design of a displacement prior injector, which strengthens not only O2M matching but also feature extraction and model training. These designs jointly form a novel and strong VIC baseline OMAN++. Extensive experiments show that OMAN++ not only outperforms state-of-the-art VIC baselines on the standard SenseCrowd, CroHD, and MovingDroneCrowd benchmarks, but also indicates a clear advantage in crowded scenes, with a 38.12% error reduction on our WuhanMetroCrowd dataset.

To tackle this, we propose the Multi-scale Implicit Structural Similarity Measurement (MS-ISSM). Unlike traditional point-to-point matching, MS-ISSM utilizes Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to represent local features continuously, transforming distortion measurement into a comparison of implicit function coefficients. This approach effectively circumvents matching errors inherent in irregular data. Additionally, we propose a ResGrouped-MLP quality assessment network, which robustly maps multi-scale feature differences to perceptual scores. The network architecture departs from traditional flat MLPs by adopting a grouped encoding strategy integrated with Residual Blocks and Channel-wise Attention mechanisms. This hierarchical design allows the model to preserve the distinct physical semantics of luma, chroma, and geometry while adaptively focusing on the most salient distortion features across High, Medium, and Low scales. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MS-ISSM outperforms state-of-the-art metrics in both reliability and generalization.

Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, including Decision Tree Induction, Bayesian classifiers, Nearest Neighbor search, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The last one is recognized as an effective approach for interpretable and explainable learning. It is grounded in the mathematical structure of the concept lattice, which enables the generation of formal concepts and the discovery of hidden relationships among them. In this paper, we present a state-of-theart review of FCA-based classifiers. We explore various methods for computing closure operators from nominal data and introduce a novel approach for constructing a partial concept lattice that focuses on the most relevant concepts. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u6790\uff08FCA\uff09\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u6807\u79f0\u6570\u636e\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ed\u5305\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6982\u5ff5\u683c\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u53d1\u73b0\uff08KDD\uff09\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9690\u85cf\u4e14\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u4f17\u591a\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u6790\uff08FCA\uff09\u56e0\u5176\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u8ba4\u53ef\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u5bf9FCA\u57fa\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u65b0\u7efc\u8ff0\uff1b2. \u63a2\u7d22\u4ece\u6807\u79f0\u6570\u636e\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ed\u5305\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u90e8\u5206\u6982\u5ff5\u683c\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u90e8\u5206\u6982\u5ff5\u683c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FCA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6982\u5ff5\u683c\u6784\u5efa\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Unlike SISR, Reference-based Super-Resolution (RefSR) leverages an additional high-resolution reference image to facilitate the recovery of high-frequency textures. However, existing research mainly focuses on backdoor attacks targeting RefSR, while the vulnerability of the adversarial attacks targeting RefSR has not been fully explored. To fill this research gap, we propose RefSR-Adv, an adversarial attack that degrades SR outputs by perturbing only the reference image. By maximizing the difference between adversarial and clean outputs, RefSR-Adv induces significant performance degradation and generates severe artifacts across CNN, Transformer, and Mamba architectures on the CUFED5, WR-SR, and DRefSR datasets. Importantly, experiments confirm a positive correlation between the similarity of the low-resolution input and the reference image and attack effectiveness, revealing that the model's over-reliance on reference features is a key security flaw.

Among these, StreamVGGT leverages frame-wise causal attention for strong streaming reconstruction, but suffers from unbounded KV cache growth, leading to escalating memory consumption and inference latency as input frames accumulate. We propose XStreamVGGT, a tuning-free approach that systematically compresses the KV cache through joint pruning and quantization, enabling extremely memory-efficient streaming inference. Specifically, redundant KVs originating from multi-view inputs are pruned through efficient token importance identification, enabling a fixed memory budget. Leveraging the unique distribution of KV tensors, we incorporate KV quantization to further reduce memory consumption. Extensive evaluations show that XStreamVGGT achieves mostly negligible performance degradation while substantially reducing memory usage by 4.42$\\times$ and accelerating inference by 5.48$\\times$, enabling scalable and practical streaming 3D applications.

In this article, we present MindChat, a privacy-preserving LLM for mental health support, together with MindCorpus, a synthetic multi-turn counseling dataset constructed via a multi-agent role-playing framework. To synthesize high-quality counseling data, the developed dialogue-construction framework employs a dual closed-loop feedback design to integrate psychological expertise and counseling techniques through role-playing: (i) turn-level critique-and-revision to improve coherence and counseling appropriateness within a session, and (ii) session-level strategy refinement to progressively enrich counselor behaviors across sessions. To mitigate privacy risks under decentralized data ownership, we fine-tune the base model using federated learning with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and incorporate differentially private optimization to reduce membership and memorization risks. Experiments on synthetic-data quality assessment and counseling capability evaluation show that MindCorpus improves training effectiveness and that MindChat is competitive with existing general and counseling-oriented LLM baselines under both automatic LLM-judge and human evaluation protocols, while exhibiting reduced privacy leakage under membership inference attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MindChat\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u914d\u5408MindCorpus\u5408\u6210\u591a\u8f6e\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u51cf\u5c11\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5728\u54a8\u8be2\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u771f\u5b9e\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff1b2\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5f00\u53d1MindCorpus\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u8f6e\u6b21\u7ea7\u6279\u5224\u4fee\u8ba2\u548c\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5f00\u53d1MindChat\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u914d\u5408LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09MindCorpus\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff1b2\uff09MindChat\u5728\u81ea\u52a8LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u5bfc\u5411\u7684LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b3\uff09MindChat\u5728\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301LLM\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u54a8\u8be2\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

LiDAR sensors capture 3D in real time, but produce sparce point clouds. Therefore, this paper presents a high-speed LiDAR point cloud densification method to generate dense 3D scene with minimal latency, addressing the need for on-the-fly depth completion while maintaining real-time performance. Our approach combines multiple LiDAR inputs with high-resolution color images and applies a joint bilateral filtering strategy implemented through a convolutional neural network architecture.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 can be effectively used for this task, but training an effective detection model requires gathering a large dataset with high-quality annotations from domain experts, which is prohibitively time-consuming. In this work, we aim to facilitate and accelerate the annotation of SAR images for avalanche mapping. We build on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a segmentation foundation model trained on natural images, and tailor it to Sentinel-1 SAR data. Adapting SAM to our use-case requires addressing several domain-specific challenges: (i) domain mismatch, since SAM was not trained on satellite/SAR imagery; (ii) input adaptation, because SAR products typically provide more than three channels, while SAM is constrained to RGB images; (iii) robustness to imprecise prompts that can affect target identification and degrade the segmentation quality, an issue exacerbated in small, low-contrast avalanches; and (iv) training efficiency, since standard fine-tuning is computationally demanding for SAM. We tackle these challenges through a combination of adapters to mitigate the domain gap, multiple encoders to handle multi-channel SAR inputs, prompt-engineering strategies to improve avalanche localization accuracy, and a training algorithm that limits the training time of the encoder, which is recognized as the major bottleneck. We integrate the resulting model into an annotation tool and show experimentally that it speeds up the annotation of SAR images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8eSegment Anything Model (SAM)\u5f00\u53d1\u7528\u4e8eSentinel-1 SAR\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u96ea\u5d29\u5206\u5272\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u3001\u591a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u89e3\u51b3\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "SAR\u56fe\u50cf\u7528\u4e8e\u96ea\u5d29\u76d1\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u8017\u65f6\u8d39\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u52a0\u901f\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7f13\u89e3\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0eSAR\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2) \u591a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u591a\u901a\u9053SAR\u8f93\u5165\uff1b3) \u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u96ea\u5d29\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b4) \u9650\u5236\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fSAR\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u8fc7\u7a0b", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\u5c06SAM\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eSAR\u96ea\u5d29\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u901a\u9053\u9650\u5236\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u6311\u6218"}}

Proper reasoning leads to understanding of a given subject. This reasoning was conceptualized as a process of understanding in a particular way, i.e., \"symbolic reasoning\". Foundational Models (FM) demonstrate that this is not a necessary condition for many reasoning tasks: they can \"reason\" by way of imitating the process of \"thinking out loud\", testing the produced pathways, and iterating on these pathways on their own. This leads to some form of reasoning that can solve problems on its own or with few-shot learning, but appears fundamentally different from human reasoning due to its lack of grounding and common sense, leading to brittleness of the reasoning process. These insights promise to substantially alter our assessment of reasoning and its necessary conditions, but also inform the approaches to safety and robust defences against this brittleness of FMs. This paper offers and discusses several philosophical interpretations of this phenomenon, argues that the previously apt metaphor of the \"stochastic parrot\" has lost its relevance and thus should be abandoned, and reflects on different normative elements in the safety- and appropriateness-considerations emerging from these reasoning models and their growing capacity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\"\u5927\u58f0\u601d\u8003\"\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6839\u57fa\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u54f2\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u653e\u5f03\"\u968f\u673a\u9e66\u9e49\"\u7684\u6bd4\u55bb\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u8ba4\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u9636\u6bb5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4f46\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\"\u5927\u58f0\u601d\u8003\"\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8def\u5f84\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8fd9\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u54f2\u5b66\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u54f2\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u54f2\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\"\u968f\u673a\u9e66\u9e49\"\u6bd4\u55bb\u5df2\u5931\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53cd\u601d\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u89c4\u8303\u8981\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\"\u601d\u8003\u8fc7\u7a0b\"\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u67d0\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u72ec\u7acb\u6216\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6839\u57fa\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u5176\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u9700\u8981\u653e\u5f03\u8fc7\u65f6\u7684\"\u968f\u673a\u9e66\u9e49\"\u6bd4\u55bb\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u89c4\u8303\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of large-scale, annotated real-world data, forcing a reliance on synthetic datasets. This reliance introduces a significant sim-to-real domain gap, leading to poor generalization, low-fidelity human geometry, and poor alignment on in-the-wild videos. To address this, we propose an innovative training paradigm that effectively leverages unlabeled in-the-wild data. Our framework bridges strong, disparate priors from scene reconstruction and HMR, and is trained with two core components: (1) a robust distillation strategy to refine human surface details by distilling high-frequency details from an expert depth model, and (2) a two-stage supervision scheme, which first learns coarse localization on synthetic data, then fine-tunes on real data by directly optimizing the geometric correspondence between the SMPL mesh and the human point cloud. This approach enables our feed-forward model to jointly recover high-fidelity scene geometry, human point clouds, camera parameters, and coherent, metric-scale SMPL bodies, all in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on human-centric scene reconstruction and delivers highly competitive results on global human motion estimation, comparing favorably against both optimization-based frameworks and HMR-only methods.

We systematically investigate action smoothness regularization through higher-order derivative penalties, progressing from theoretical understanding in continuous control benchmarks to practical validation in building energy management. Our comprehensive evaluation across four continuous control environments demonstrates that third-order derivative penalties (jerk minimization) consistently achieve superior smoothness while maintaining competitive performance. We extend these findings to HVAC control systems where smooth policies reduce equipment switching by 60%, translating to significant operational benefits.

We propose Contrastive Object-centric Diffusion Alignment (CODA), a simple extension that (i) employs register slots to absorb residual attention and reduce interference between object slots, and (ii) applies a contrastive alignment loss to explicitly encourage slot-image correspondence. The resulting training objective serves as a tractable surrogate for maximizing mutual information (MI) between slots and inputs, strengthening slot representation quality. On both synthetic (MOVi-C/E) and real-world datasets (VOC, COCO), CODA improves object discovery (e.g., +6.1% FG-ARI on COCO), property prediction, and compositional image generation over strong baselines.

Recent studies have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate formulation and process development, drastically transforming current approaches to pharmaceutical 3D printing. To date, most AI-driven efforts remain narrowly focused, while failing to account for the broader formulation challenges inherent to the technology. Recent advances in AI have introduced artificial general intelligence concepts, wherein systems extend beyond conventional predictive modelling toward more generalised, human-like reasoning. In this work, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) dataset comprising over 1400 formulations, to recommend suitable excipients based on active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dose, and predict filament mechanical properties. Four LLM architectures were fine-tuned, with systematic evaluation of both fine-tuning and generative parameter configurations. Our results demonstrate that Llama2 was best suited for recommending excipients for FDM formulations. Additionally, model selection and parameterisation significantly influence performance, with smaller LLMs exhibiting instances of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate: (i) even with relatively small dataset of over 1400 formulations, it can lead to model catastrophic forgetting; (ii) standard LLM metrics only evaluate linguistic performance but not formulation processability; and (iii) LLMs trained on biomedically-related data do not always produce the best results. Addressing these challenges is essential to advancing LLMs beyond linguistic proficiency and toward reliable systems for pharmaceutical formulation development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u836f\u72693D\u6253\u5370\u4e2d\u7684\u8f85\u6599\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Llama2\u6a21\u578b\u5728FDM\u5236\u5242\u8f85\u6599\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1AI\u5df2\u5f00\u59cb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u836f\u72693D\u6253\u5370\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u72ed\u7a84\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u5728\u836f\u7269\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b1400\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u65b9\u7684\u7194\u878d\u6c89\u79ef\u5efa\u6a21\uff08FDM\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u56db\u79cdLLM\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u8bad\u7ec3\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d3b\u6027\u836f\u7269\u6210\u5206\uff08API\uff09\u5242\u91cf\u63a8\u8350\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8f85\u6599\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u957f\u4e1d\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aLlama2\u6a21\u578b\u5728FDM\u5236\u5242\u8f85\u6599\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u5373\u4f7f\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff081400+\u914d\u65b9\uff09\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b2\uff09\u6807\u51c6LLM\u6307\u6807\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u800c\u975e\u5236\u5242\u53ef\u52a0\u5de5\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LLM\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u836f\u7269\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u673a\u9047\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8LLM\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u836f\u7269\u5236\u5242\u5f00\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

State-of-the-art methods typically assign each training sample a positive and a negative weight, optimizing the assignment scheme during training. However, these strategies often assign an insufficient number of positive samples to small objects, leading to a scale imbalance during training. To address this limitation, we introduce RFAssigner, a novel assignment strategy designed to enhance the multi-scale learning capabilities of dense detectors. RFAssigner first establishes an initial set of positive samples using a point-based prior. It then leverages a Gaussian Receptive Field (GRF) distance to measure the similarity between the GRFs of unassigned candidate locations and the ground-truth objects. Based on this metric, RFAssigner adaptively selects supplementary positive samples from the unassigned pool, promoting a more balanced learning process across object scales. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets with distinct object scale distributions validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method.

To address this, we propose an LLM-based MambaFormer hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for efficient medical question-answering (QA) and clinical assistance. The MambaFormer employs a lightweight gating mechanism that performs token-level dynamic routing to a customized Transformer expert (ET5) for short, complex queries or to a State Space Model expert (EMamba) for long, high-throughput sequences. The customized EMamba and ET5 models are tailored to accommodate input sequence dimensionality, embedding structure, sequence length, and target-specific output heads, and are fine-tuned through transfer learning on a new, custom-designed DentalQA dataset. Moreover, intelligent routing decisions are driven by the contextual complexity of token embeddings, normalized sequence length, and domain-aware features, thereby enforcing a Pareto-optimal trade-off between inference latency and prediction accuracy.

While \\textit{Chain-of-Thought} (CoT) prompting allows agents to generate human-readable reasoning traces, it remains unclear whether these traces are \\textbf{faithful} generative drivers of the model's output or merely \\textbf{post-hoc rationalizations}. We introduce \\textbf{Project Ariadne}, a novel XAI framework that utilizes Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and counterfactual logic to audit the causal integrity of agentic reasoning. Unlike existing interpretability methods that rely on surface-level textual similarity, Project Ariadne performs \\textbf{hard interventions} ($do$-calculus) on intermediate reasoning nodes -- systematically inverting logic, negating premises, and reversing factual claims -- to measure the \\textbf{Causal Sensitivity} ($\u03c6$) of the terminal answer. Our empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a persistent \\textit{Faithfulness Gap}. We define and detect a widespread failure mode termed \\textbf{Causal Decoupling}, where agents exhibit a violation density ($\u03c1$) of up to $0.77$ in factual and scientific domains. In these instances, agents arrive at identical conclusions despite contradictory internal logic, proving that their reasoning traces function as \"Reasoning Theater\" while decision-making is governed by latent parametric priors. Our findings suggest that current agentic architectures are inherently prone to unfaithful explanation, and we propose the Ariadne Score as a new benchmark for aligning stated logic with model action.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\"\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u9e3f\u6c9f\"\uff0c\u5176\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u53ef\u80fd\u53ea\u662f\"\u63a8\u7406\u5267\u573a\"\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u903b\u8f91\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u5f97\u51fa\u76f8\u540c\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u627f\u62c5\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u867d\u7136\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u8ba9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e8b\u540e\u5408\u7406\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProject Ariadne\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u903b\u8f91\u6765\u5ba1\u8ba1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u786c\u5e72\u9884\uff08do-\u6f14\u7b97\uff09\u5bf9\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8282\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u53cd\u8f6c\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u5426\u5b9a\u524d\u63d0\u3001\u53cd\u8f6c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e3b\u5f20\uff09\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ec8\u7aef\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\"\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u9e3f\u6c9f\"\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u7684\"\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u8026\"\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u8fdd\u53cd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9ad8\u8fbe0.77\u3002\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u903b\u8f91\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u5f97\u51fa\u76f8\u540c\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ea\u662f\"\u63a8\u7406\u5267\u573a\"\uff0c\u800c\u51b3\u7b56\u7531\u6f5c\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06Ariadne\u5206\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u9648\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Falcon-H1R stands out for its parameter efficiency, consistently matching or outperforming SOTA reasoning models that are $2\\times$ to $7\\times$ larger across a variety of reasoning-intensive benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of careful data curation and targeted training strategies (via both efficient SFT and RL scaling) in delivering significant performance gains without increasing model size. Furthermore, Falcon-H1R advances the 3D limits of reasoning efficiency by combining faster inference (through its hybrid-parallel architecture design), token efficiency, and higher accuracy. This unique blend makes Falcon-H1R-7B a practical backbone for scaling advanced reasoning systems, particularly in scenarios requiring extensive chain-of-thoughts generation and parallel test-time scaling. Leveraging the recently introduced DeepConf approach, Falcon-H1R achieves state-of-the-art test-time scaling efficiency, offering substantial improvements in both accuracy and computational cost.

To study this regime, we introduce VReID-XFD, a video-based benchmark and community challenge for extreme far-distance (XFD) aerial-to-ground person re-identification. VReID-XFD is derived from the DetReIDX dataset and comprises 371 identities, 11,288 tracklets, and 11.75 million frames, captured across altitudes from 5.8 m to 120 m, viewing angles from oblique (30 degrees) to nadir (90 degrees), and horizontal distances up to 120 m. The benchmark supports aerial-to-aerial, aerial-to-ground, and ground-to-aerial evaluation under strict identity-disjoint splits, with rich physical metadata. The VReID-XFD-25 Challenge attracted 10 teams with hundreds of submissions. Systematic analysis reveals monotonic performance degradation with altitude and distance, a universal disadvantage of nadir views, and a trade-off between peak performance and robustness.

To address this challenge, we introduce LinMU (Linear-complexity Multimodal Understanding), a VLM design that achieves linear complexity without using any quadratic-complexity modules while maintaining the performance of global-attention-based VLMs. LinMU replaces every self-attention layer in the VLM with the M-MATE block: a dual-branch module that combines a bidirectional state-space model for global context (Flex-MA branch) with localized Swin-style window attention (Local-Swin branch) for adjacent correlations. To transform a pre-trained VLM into the LinMU architecture, we propose a three-stage distillation framework that (i) initializes both branches with self-attention weights and trains the Flex-MA branch alone, (ii) unfreezes the Local-Swin branch and fine-tunes it jointly with the Flex-MA branch, and (iii) unfreezes the remaining blocks and fine-tunes them using LoRA adapters, while regressing on hidden states and token-level logits of the frozen VLM teacher. On MMMU, TextVQA, LongVideoBench, Video-MME, and other benchmarks, LinMU matches the performance of teacher models, yet reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 2.7$\\times$ and improves token throughput by up to 9.0$\\times$ on minute-length videos. Ablations confirm the importance of each distillation stage and the necessity of the two branches of the M-MATE block.

Existing methods, mainly based on reducing neural decoding to generation tasks or simple correlations, fail to reflect the hierarchical and temporal processes of visual processing in the brain. To address these limitations, we present NeuroAlign, a novel framework for fine-grained fMRI-video alignment inspired by the hierarchical organization of the human visual system. Our framework implements a two-stage mechanism that mirrors biological visual pathways: global semantic understanding through Neural-Temporal Contrastive Learning (NTCL) and fine-grained pattern matching through enhanced vector quantization. NTCL explicitly models temporal dynamics through bidirectional prediction between modalities, while our DynaSyncMM-EMA approach enables dynamic multi-modal fusion with adaptive weighting. Experiments demonstrate that NeuroAlign significantly outperforms existing methods in cross-modal retrieval tasks, establishing a new paradigm for understanding visual cognitive mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroAlign\uff1a\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u542f\u53d1\u7684fMRI-\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf-\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u7b80\u5355\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u5927\u8111\u89c6\u89c9\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u8111\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNeuroAlign\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u7269\u89c6\u89c9\u901a\u8def\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf-\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff08NTCL\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff1b\u91c7\u7528DynaSyncMM-EMA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eNeuroAlign\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuroAlign\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86fMRI-\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Conditioning on a single image completely ignores the temporal signature, which leads to pose-locked motions, unnatural warping, and \"average\" faces when viewpoints and expressions change. To this end, we introduce an identity-conditioned variant of a diffusion-transformer video generator which uses a short reference video rather than a single portrait. Our key idea is to incorporate the dynamics in the reference. A short clip reveals subject-specific patterns, e.g., how smiles form, across poses and lighting. From this clip, a Sinkhorn-routed encoder learns compact identity tokens that capture characteristic dynamics while remaining pretrained backbone-compatible. Despite adding only lightweight conditioning, the approach consistently improves identity retention under large pose changes and expressive facial behavior, while maintaining prompt faithfulness and visual realism across diverse subjects and prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77ed\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Sinkhorn\u8def\u7531\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u51d1\u8eab\u4efd\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u4e30\u5bcc\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u8eab\u4efd\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u5b8c\u5168\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u59ff\u6001\u9501\u5b9a\u3001\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u626d\u66f2\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\"\u5e73\u5747\u5316\"\u9762\u5b54", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8eab\u4efd\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u77ed\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u9891\u800c\u975e\u5355\u5f20\u8096\u50cf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7Sinkhorn\u8def\u7531\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5b9a\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u793a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u8868\u60c5\u4e0b\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\u548c\u63d0\u793a", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u77ed\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8eab\u4efd\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, ReID faces significant challenges such as appearance variations, domain shifts, and limited labeled data. This dissertation proposes three advanced approaches to enhance ReID performance under supervised, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), and fully unsupervised settings. First, SCM-ReID integrates supervised contrastive learning with hybrid loss optimization (classification, center, triplet, and centroid-triplet losses), improving discriminative feature representation and achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on Market-1501 and CUHK03 datasets. Second, for UDA, IQAGA and DAPRH combine GAN-based image augmentation, domain-invariant mapping, and pseudo-label refinement to mitigate domain discrepancies and enhance cross-domain generalization. Experiments demonstrate substantial gains over baseline methods, with mAP and Rank-1 improvements up to 12% in challenging transfer scenarios. Finally, ViTC-UReID leverages Vision Transformer-based feature encoding and camera-aware proxy learning to boost unsupervised ReID. By integrating global and local attention with camera identity constraints, this method significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches on large-scale benchmarks. Comprehensive evaluations across CUHK03, Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Embedding IMUs into loose-fitting garments is a desirable alternative, yet sensor-body displacement introduces severe, structured, and location-dependent corruption that breaks standard inertial pipelines. We propose GID (Garment Inertial Denoiser), a lightweight, plug-and-play Transformer that factorizes loose-wear MoCap into three stages: (i) location-specific denoising, (ii) adaptive cross-wear fusion, and (iii) general pose prediction. GID uses a location-aware expert architecture, where a shared spatio-temporal backbone models global motion while per-IMU expert heads specialize in local garment dynamics, and a lightweight fusion module ensures cross-part consistency. This inductive bias enables stable training and effective learning from limited paired loose-tight IMU data. We also introduce GarMoCap, a combined public and newly collected dataset covering diverse users, motions, and garments. Experiments show that GID enables accurate, real-time denoising from single-user training and generalizes across unseen users, motions, and garment types, consistently improving state-of-the-art inertial MoCap methods when used as a drop-in module.", "AI": {"tldr": "GID\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5bbd\u677e\u670d\u88c5\u4e2dIMU\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f4d\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7528\u6237\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u670d\u88c5\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u60ef\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u7d27\u5bc6\u9644\u7740\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u65e5\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u8bf4\u65e2\u4fb5\u5165\u53c8\u4e0d\u8212\u9002\u3002\u5c06IMU\u5d4c\u5165\u5bbd\u677e\u670d\u88c5\u662f\u7406\u60f3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u611f\u5668-\u8eab\u4f53\u4f4d\u79fb\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u6807\u51c6\u60ef\u6027\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGID\uff08\u670d\u88c5\u60ef\u6027\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1\uff09\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7279\u5b9a\u53bb\u566a\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8de8\u670d\u88c5\u878d\u5408\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u7528\u59ff\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u65f6\u7a7a\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u5168\u5c40\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2aIMU\u4e13\u5bb6\u5934\u4e13\u95e8\u5904\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u670d\u88c5\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u90e8\u4f4d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "GID\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u7528\u6237\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7528\u6237\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u670d\u88c5\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86GarMoCap\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "GID\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bbd\u677e\u670d\u88c5\u4e2dIMU\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f4d\u79fb\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8212\u9002\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e5\u5e38\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This morphology can be regarded as an SE(3)-invariant, denoised volumetric representation of subvolumes extracted from tomograms. Inferring morphology is therefore an inverse problem of estimating both a template morphology and its SE(3) transformation. Existing expectation-maximization based solution to this problem often misses rare but important morphologies and requires extensive manual hyperparameter tuning. Addressing this issue, we present a disentangled deep representation learning framework that separates SE(3) transformations from morphological content in the representation space. The framework includes a novel multi-choice learning module that enables this disentanglement for highly noisy cryo-ET data, and the learned morphological content is used to generate template morphologies.

However, existing works focus on 2D parking slot perception, mapping, and localization, 3D reconstruction remains underexplored, which is crucial for capturing complex spatial geometry in parking scenarios. Naively improving the visual quality of reconstructed parking scenes does not directly benefit autonomous parking, as the key entry point for parking is the slots perception module. To address these limitations, we curate the first benchmark named ParkRecon3D, specifically designed for parking scene reconstruction. It includes sensor data from four surround-view fisheye cameras with calibrated extrinsics and dense parking slot annotations. We then propose ParkGaussian, the first framework that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for parking scene reconstruction. To further improve the alignment between reconstruction and downstream parking slot detection, we introduce a slot-aware reconstruction strategy that leverages existing parking perception methods to enhance the synthesis quality of slot regions. Experiments on ParkRecon3D demonstrate that ParkGaussian achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and better preserves perception consistency for downstream tasks.

This work introduces SwinIFS, a landmark-guided super-resolution framework that integrates structural priors with hierarchical attention mechanisms to achieve identity-preserving reconstruction at both moderate and extreme upscaling factors. The method incorporates dense Gaussian heatmaps of key facial landmarks into the input representation, enabling the network to focus on semantically important facial regions from the earliest stages of processing. A compact Swin Transformer backbone is employed to capture long-range contextual information while preserving local geometry, allowing the model to restore subtle facial textures and maintain global structural consistency. Extensive experiments on the CelebA benchmark demonstrate that SwinIFS achieves superior perceptual quality, sharper reconstructions, and improved identity retention; it consistently produces more photorealistic results and exhibits strong performance even under 8x magnification, where most methods fail to recover meaningful structure. SwinIFS also provides an advantageous balance between reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications in facial enhancement, surveillance, and digital restoration.

Conventional multi-task attribute recognition methods often process the entire feature map for feature extraction and attribute classification, which can produce redundant features due to reliance on global regions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach emphasizing the selection of specific feature regions for efficient feature learning. We introduce the Mask-Guided Multi-Task Network (MGMTN), which integrates Adaptive Mask Learning (AML) and Group-Global Feature Fusion (G2FF) to address the aforementioned limitations. Leveraging a pre-trained keypoint annotation model and a fully convolutional network, AML accurately localizes critical facial parts (e.g., eye and mouth groups) and generates group masks that delineate meaningful feature regions, thereby mitigating negative transfer from global region usage.

To push the boundaries of VLMs in remote sensing, we specifically address vehicle imagery captured by drones and introduce a spatially-aware dataset AirSpatial, which comprises over 206K instructions and introduces two novel tasks: Spatial Grounding and Spatial Question Answering. It is also the first remote sensing grounding dataset to provide 3DBB. To effectively leverage existing image understanding of VLMs to spatial domains, we adopt a two-stage training strategy comprising Image Understanding Pre-training and Spatial Understanding Fine-tuning. Utilizing this trained spatially-aware VLM, we develop an aerial agent, AirSpatialBot, which is capable of fine-grained vehicle attribute recognition and retrieval. By dynamically integrating task planning, image understanding, spatial understanding, and task execution capabilities, AirSpatialBot adapts to diverse query requirements.

Existing methods utilize global depth regularization to mitigate artifacts, leading to the loss of geometric boundary details. To address this problem, we propose EdgeNeRF, an edge-guided sparse-view 3D reconstruction algorithm. Our method leverages the prior that abrupt changes in depth and normals generate edges. Specifically, we first extract edges from input images, then apply depth and normal regularization constraints to non-edge regions, enhancing geometric consistency while preserving high-frequency details at boundaries. Experiments on LLFF and DTU datasets demonstrate EdgeNeRF's superior performance, particularly in retaining sharp geometric boundaries and suppressing artifacts. Additionally, the proposed edge-guided depth regularization module can be seamlessly integrated into other methods in a plug-and-play manner, significantly improving their performance without substantially increasing training time.

Existing methods attempt to address both tasks within a single unified stage. We question this design, as the annotation imbalance between known and unknown classes often leads to negative transfer of known classes and underfitting for unknowns. To overcome these issues, we propose SATS, a Separating-then-Adapting Training Strategy, which addresses OSDA-SS through two sequential steps: known/unknown separation and unknown-aware domain adaptation. By providing the model with more accurate and well-aligned unknown classes, our method ensures a balanced learning of discriminative features for both known and unknown classes, steering the model toward discovering truly unknown objects. Additionally, we present hard unknown exploration, an innovative data augmentation method that exposes the model to more challenging unknowns, strengthening its ability to capture more comprehensive understanding of target unknowns. We evaluate our method on public OSDA-SS benchmarks.

Furthermore, we conducted extensive experiments on PIN++, including part segmentation, object segmentation, and few-shot learning, exploring various ways to leverage part annotations in downstream tasks.

To address these issues, we present the Decoupled-experts Arbitration Few-Shot SegNet (DA-FSS), a model that effectively distinguishes between semantic and geometric paths and mutually regularizes their gradients to achieve better generalization. DA-FSS employs the same backbone and pre-trained text encoder as MM-FSS to generate text embeddings, which can increase free modalities' utilization rate and better leverage each modality's information space. To achieve this, we propose a Parallel Expert Refinement module to generate each modal correlation. We also propose a Stacked Arbitration Module (SAM) to perform convolutional fusion and arbitrate correlations for each modality pathway. The Parallel Experts decouple two paths: a Geometric Expert maintains plasticity, and a Semantic Expert ensures stability. They are coordinated via a Decoupled Alignment Module (DAM) that transfers knowledge without propagating confusion.

Under a frozen-backbone calibration setting, we recover metric depth via an image-specific affine transform in inverse depth and train only lightweight calibration heads while keeping the relative-depth backbone and the CLIP text encoder fixed. Since captions provide coarse but noisy scale cues that vary with phrasing and missing objects, we use language to predict an uncertainty-aware envelope that bounds feasible calibration parameters in an unconstrained space, rather than committing to a text-only point estimate. We then use pooled multi-scale frozen visual features to select an image-specific calibration within this envelope. During training, a closed-form least-squares oracle in inverse depth provides per-image supervision for learning the envelope and the selected calibration.

However, a common challenge arises when working with medical images generated by different systems or even the same system with different parameter settings. Such images contain diverse textures and reverberation noise that violate the aforementioned assumption. Consequently, models trained on data from one device or setting often struggle to perform effectively with data from other devices or settings. In addition, retraining models for each specific device or setting is labor-intensive and costly. To address these issues in ultrasound images, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model. We formulated the domain adaptation tasks as an image-to-image translation task, in which we modified the texture patterns and removed reverberation noise in the test data images from the source domain to align with those in the target domain images while keeping the image content unchanged. We applied the proposed method to two datasets containing carotid ultrasound images from three different domains. The experimental results demonstrate that the model successfully translated the texture pattern of images and removed reverberation noise from the ultrasound images. Furthermore, we evaluated the CycleGAN approaches for a comparative study with the proposed model. The experimental findings conclusively demonstrated that the proposed model achieved domain adaptation (histogram correlation (0.960 (0.019), & 0.920 (0.043) and bhattacharya distance (0.040 (0.020), & 0.085 (0.048)), compared to no adaptation (0.916 (0.062) & 0.890 (0.077), 0.090 (0.070) & 0.121 (0.095)) for both datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u5907/\u53c2\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u6df7\u54cd\u566a\u58f0\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u5907\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u6df7\u54cd\u566a\u58f0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6e90\u57df\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fee\u6539\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u53bb\u9664\u6df7\u54cd\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u7684\u9888\u52a8\u8109\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u8f6c\u6362\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u53bb\u9664\u6df7\u54cd\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u4e0e\u65e0\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff080.960 vs 0.916\uff09\u548c\u5df4\u6c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\uff080.040 vs 0.090\uff09\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684GAN-based\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u5907/\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

Since coastal scenarios are unpredictable and scenes have dynamic properties it is essential to apply detection methods that are robust to these conditions. This paper presents modified ViBe for moving object detection which detects ships and backwash. In the modified ViBe the probability of losing ships is decreased in comparison with the original ViBe. It is robust to natural sea waves and variation of lights and is capable of quickly updating the background.

AD, the primary driver of dementia, manifests through progressive cognitive and neuroanatomical changes like atrophy and ventricular expansion, making robust, generalizable classification essential for real-world use. While convolutional neural networks and transformers have advanced feature extraction via attention and fusion techniques, single-domain generalization (SDG) remains underexplored yet critical, given the fragmented nature of AD datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce Extended MixStyle (EM), a framework for blending higher-order feature moments (skewness and kurtosis) to mimic diverse distributional variations. Trained on sMRI data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC; n=4,647) to differentiate persons with normal cognition (NC) from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD and tested on three unseen cohorts (total n=3,126), EM yields enhanced cross-domain performance, improving macro-F1 on average by 2.4 percentage points over state-of-the-art SDG benchmarks, underscoring its promise for invariant, reliable AD detection in heterogeneous real-world settings.

At present, diffusion inversion still remains a challenging task due to the lack of viable supervision signals. Thus, most existing methods resort to approximation-based solutions, which however are often at the cost of performance or efficiency. To remedy these shortcomings, we propose a novel self-supervised diffusion inversion approach in this paper, termed Deep Inversion (DeepInv). Instead of requiring ground-truth noise annotations, we introduce a self-supervised objective as well as a data augmentation strategy to generate high-quality pseudo noises from real images without manual intervention. Based on these two innovative designs, DeepInv is also equipped with an iterative and multi-scale training regime to train a parameterized inversion solver, thereby achieving the fast and accurate image-to-noise mapping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of presenting a trainable solver to predict inversion noise step by step.

Then, a deep teacher network extracts robust features from both original and synthetic data. Finally, a compact student network learns from the teacher via knowledge distillation, balancing generalization and computational efficiency.\n  Evaluated on a multi-center dataset of 1,435 cases, the synthetic images were of good quality.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising solution, but current methods remain inefficient and often fail to maintain high answer quality. To address these challenges, we propose VideoSpeculateRAG, an efficient VLM-based RAG framework built on two key ideas. First, we introduce a speculative decoding pipeline: a lightweight draft model quickly generates multiple answer candidates, which are then verified and refined by a more accurate heavyweight model, substantially reducing inference latency without sacrificing correctness. Second, we identify a major source of error - incorrect entity recognition in retrieved knowledge - and mitigate it with a simple yet effective similarity-based filtering strategy that improves entity alignment and boosts overall answer accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that VideoSpeculateRAG achieves comparable or higher accuracy than standard RAG approaches while accelerating inference by approximately 2x.

The methodology includes a down-sampling pathway for feature extraction and an up-sampling pathway for detail restoration, enhanced for medical imaging. Key modifications include techniques for better contextual understanding crucial in cardiac MRI segmentation. The dataset consists of 805 left ventricular MRI scans from 45 patients, with comparative analysis using established metrics such as the dice coefficient and mean perpendicular distance. GBU-Net significantly improves the accuracy of left ventricle segmentation in cine MRI scans. Its innovative design outperforms existing methods in tests, surpassing standard metrics like the dice coefficient and mean perpendicular distance.

In autonomous driving, this vision gives rise to driving world models: generative simulators that imagine ego and agent futures, enabling scalable simulation, safe testing of corner cases, and rich synthetic data generation. Yet, despite fast-growing research activity, the field lacks a rigorous benchmark to measure progress and guide priorities. Existing evaluations remain limited: generic video metrics overlook safety-critical imaging factors; trajectory plausibility is rarely quantified; temporal and agent-level consistency is neglected; and controllability with respect to ego conditioning is ignored. Moreover, current datasets fail to cover the diversity of conditions required for real-world deployment. To address these gaps, we present DrivingGen, the first comprehensive benchmark for generative driving world models. DrivingGen combines a diverse evaluation dataset curated from both driving datasets and internet-scale video sources, spanning varied weather, time of day, geographic regions, and complex maneuvers, with a suite of new metrics that jointly assess visual realism, trajectory plausibility, temporal coherence, and controllability. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art models reveals clear trade-offs: general models look better but break physics, while driving-specific ones capture motion realistically but lag in visual quality.

While recent grounding transfer works have advanced the field through one-tower architectures, they still suffer from two primary limitations: (1) over-entangled multimodal representations that exacerbate deceptive modality biases, and (2) insufficient semantic reasoning that hinders the comprehension of referential cues. In this paper, we propose BARE, a bias-aware and reasoning-enhanced framework for one-tower visual grounding. BARE introduces a mechanism that preserves modality-specific features and constructs referential semantics through three novel modules: (i) language salience modulator, (ii) visual bias correction and (iii) referential relationship enhancement, which jointly mitigate multimodal distractions and enhance referential comprehension. Extensive experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate that BARE not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also delivers superior computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Despite advancements in AI, clinically viable segmentation is often hindered by the scarcity of 3D annotations, patient-specific variability, data privacy concerns, and substantial computational overhead. In this work, we propose FALCON, a cross-domain few-shot segmentation framework that achieves high-precision 3D volume segmentation by processing data as 2D slices. The framework is first meta-trained on natural images to learn-to-learn generalizable segmentation priors, then transferred to the medical domain via adversarial fine-tuning and boundary-aware learning. Task-aware inference, conditioned on support cues, allows FALCON to adapt dynamically to patient-specific anatomical variations across slices. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that FALCON consistently achieves the lowest Hausdorff Distance scores, indicating superior boundary accuracy while maintaining a Dice Similarity Coefficient comparable to the state-of-the-art models.

However, most such methods rely on vast amounts of pretraining data. This work introduces Subimage Overlap Prediction, a novel self-supervised pretraining task to aid semantic segmentation in remote sensing imagery that uses significantly lesser pretraining imagery. Given an image, a sub-image is extracted and the model is trained to produce a semantic mask of the location of the extracted sub-image within the original image. We demonstrate that pretraining with this task results in significantly faster convergence, and equal or better performance (measured via mIoU) on downstream segmentation. This gap in convergence and performance widens when labeled training data is reduced. We show this across multiple architecture types, and with multiple downstream datasets. We also show that our method matches or exceeds performance while requiring significantly lesser pretraining data relative to other SSL methods.

This flexible tokenization is typically achieved through nested dropout, where a portion of trailing tokens is randomly truncated during training, and the image is reconstructed using the remaining preceding sequence. However, this tail-truncation strategy inherently concentrates the image information in the early tokens, limiting the effectiveness of downstream AutoRegressive (AR) image generation as the token length increases. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{ReToK}, a flexible tokenizer with \\underline{Re}dundant \\underline{Tok}en Padding and Hierarchical Semantic Regularization, designed to fully exploit all tokens for enhanced latent modeling. Specifically, we introduce \\textbf{Redundant Token Padding} to activate tail tokens more frequently, thereby alleviating information over-concentration in the early tokens. In addition, we apply \\textbf{Hierarchical Semantic Regularization} to align the decoding features of earlier tokens with those from a pre-trained vision foundation model, while progressively reducing the regularization strength toward the tail to allow finer low-level detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ReTok: on ImageNet 256$\\times$256, our method achieves superior generation performance compared with both flexible and fixed-length tokenizers.

In this paper, we introduce an innovative Vision-Language Model (VLM) for Face Verification, which not only accurately determines if two face images depict the same individual but also explicitly explains the rationale behind its decisions. Our model is uniquely trained using two complementary explanation styles: (1) concise explanations that summarize the key factors influencing its decision, and (2) comprehensive explanations detailing the specific differences observed between the images. We adapt and enhance a state-of-the-art modeling approach originally designed for audio-based differentiation to suit visual inputs effectively. This cross-modal transfer significantly improves our model's accuracy and interpretability. The proposed VLM integrates sophisticated feature extraction techniques with advanced reasoning capabilities, enabling clear articulation of its verification process.

Owing to its rapid spread characteristics, early and precise identification is crucial to prevent outbreaks and ensure timely intervention. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning-based approach called LUMPNet for the early detection of LSD. LUMPNet utilizes image data to detect and classify skin nodules -- the primary indicator of LSD. To this end, LUMPNet uses YOLOv11, EfficientNet-based CNN classifier with compound scaling, and a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer. More precisely, LUMPNet detects and localizes LSD skin nodules and lesions on cattle images. It exploits EfficientNet to classify the localized cattle images into LSD-affected or healthy categories. To stabilize and accelerate the training of YOLOv11 and EfficientNet hybrid model, a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer is proposed and utilized. We evaluate LUMPNet at various stages of LSD using a publicly available dataset.

This challenge persists in automated Few-shot Font Generation (FFG), where models often struggle to preserve both the structural integrity and stylistic fidelity from limited references. While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities, their application to FFG is constrained by conventional patch-level tokenization, which neglects global dependencies crucial for coherent font synthesis. Moreover, existing FFG methods remain within the image-to-image paradigm, relying solely on visual references and overlooking the role of language in conveying stylistic intent during font design. To address these limitations, we propose GAR-Font, a novel AR framework for multimodal few-shot font generation. GAR-Font introduces a global-aware tokenizer that effectively captures both local structures and global stylistic patterns, a multimodal style encoder offering flexible style control through a lightweight language-style adapter without requiring intensive multimodal pretraining, and a post-refinement pipeline that further enhances structural fidelity and style coherence. Extensive experiments show that GAR-Font outperforms existing FFG methods, excelling in maintaining global style faithfulness and achieving higher-quality results with textual stylistic guidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "GAR-Font\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b57\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u98ce\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7ec6\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b57\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u5206\u8bcd\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b57\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2\uff09\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u4f20\u8fbe\u5b57\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u98ce\u683c\u610f\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGAR-Font\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u98ce\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u98ce\u683c\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\uff1b3\uff09\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7ec6\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGAR-Font\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b57\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u98ce\u683c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u98ce\u683c\u6307\u5bfc\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "GAR-Font\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b57\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b57\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In the RSwinV2 method, a hierarchical structure of the transformer has been customized based on the input dimensionality, embedding structure, and output targeted by the method. In this RSwinV2 approach, the input image has been split into non-overlapping patches and processed using shifted windows and attention in these patches. This process has helped the method link all the windows efficiently by avoiding the locality issues of non-overlapping regions in attention, while being computationally efficient. RSwinV2 has further developed based on SwinTransformer and has included patch and position embeddings to take advantage of the transformer global-linking capability by employing multi-head attention in these embeddings. Furthermore, RSwinV2 has developed and incorporated the Inverse Residual Block (IRB) into this method, which utilizes convolutional skip connections with these inclusive designs to address the vanishing gradient issues during processing. RSwinV2 inclusion of IRB has therefore facilitated this method to link global patterns as well as local patterns; hence, its integrity has helped improve lesion classification capability by minimizing variability of Mpox and increasing differences of Mpox, chickenpox, measles, and cowpox. In testing SwinV2, its accuracy of 96.21 and an F1score of 95.62 have been achieved on the Kaggle public dataset, which has outperformed standard CNN models and SwinTransformers; RSwinV2 vector has thus proved its valiance as a computer-assisted tool for Mpox lesion observation interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRSwinV2\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8eMpox\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u6b8b\u5deeSwinTransformerV2\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9006\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728Kaggle\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523096.21%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c95.62% F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "Mpox\uff08\u7334\u75d8\uff09\u8bca\u65ad\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u533a\u5206\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\uff08\u5982\u6c34\u75d8\u3001\u9ebb\u75b9\u3001\u725b\u75d8\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709CNN\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6807\u51c6SwinTransformer\u5728\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSwinTransformerV2\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5f00\u53d1RSwinV2\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42Transformer\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u5236\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u4e0d\u91cd\u53e0\u7684patch\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u79fb\u4f4d\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u9006\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757\uff08IRB\uff09\u5904\u7406\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff1b4\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Kaggle\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRSwinV2\u8fbe\u523096.21%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c95.62% F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6CNN\u6a21\u578b\u548cSwinTransformer\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206Mpox\u3001\u6c34\u75d8\u3001\u9ebb\u75b9\u548c\u725b\u75d8\u3002", "conclusion": "RSwinV2\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u94fe\u63a5\u80fd\u529b\u548cIRB\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Mpox\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Recent works have leveraged the inherent redundancy in visual content to make training more affordable by training only on a subset of visual information. While these methods were successful in providing cheaper and more effective training, sparsely trained diffusion models struggle in inference. This is due to their lacking response to Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) leading to underwhelming performance during inference. To overcome this, we propose Sparse Guidance (SG). Instead of using conditional dropout as a signal to guide diffusion models, SG uses token-level sparsity. As a result, SG preserves the high-variance of the conditional prediction better, achieving good quality and high variance outputs. Leveraging token-level sparsity at inference, SG improves fidelity at lower compute, achieving 1.58 FID on the commonly used ImageNet-256 benchmark with 25% fewer FLOPs, and yields up to 58% FLOP savings at matched baseline quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Sparse Guidance, we train a 2.5B text-to-image diffusion model using training time sparsity and leverage SG during inference.

Some recent works recognize that visual perception is a bottleneck in visual mathematical reasoning, but their solutions are limited to improving the extraction and interpretation of visual inputs. Notably, they all ignore the key issue of whether the extracted visual cues are faithfully integrated and properly utilized in subsequent reasoning. Motivated by this, we present CogFlow, a novel cognitive-inspired three-stage framework that incorporates a knowledge internalization stage, explicitly simulating the hierarchical flow of human reasoning: perception$\\Rightarrow$internalization$\\Rightarrow$reasoning. Inline with this hierarchical flow, we holistically enhance all its stages. We devise Synergistic Visual Rewards to boost perception capabilities in parametric and semantic spaces, jointly improving visual information extraction from symbols and diagrams. To guarantee faithful integration of extracted visual cues into subsequent reasoning, we introduce a Knowledge Internalization Reward model in the internalization stage, bridging perception and reasoning. Moreover, we design a Visual-Gated Policy Optimization algorithm to further enforce the reasoning is grounded with the visual knowledge, preventing models seeking shortcuts that appear coherent but are visually ungrounded reasoning chains. Moreover, we contribute a new dataset MathCog for model training, which contains samples with over 120K high-quality perception-reasoning aligned annotations.

While such prompts can embed prior knowledge about diagnostic quality, they often introduce bias by reflecting idealized definitions that may not hold under real-world degradations such as noise, motion artifacts, or scanner variability. To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Prompt-guided Image Quality Assessment (CAP-IQA) framework, which integrates text-level priors with instance-level context prompts and applies causal debiasing to separate idealized knowledge from factual, image-specific degradations. Our framework combines a CNN-based visual encoder with a domain-specific text encoder to assess diagnostic visibility, anatomical clarity, and noise perception in abdominal CT images. The model leverages radiology-style prompts and context-aware fusion to align semantic and perceptual representations. On the 2023 LDCTIQA challenge benchmark, CAP-IQA achieves an overall correlation score of 2.8590 (sum of PLCC, SROCC, and KROCC), surpassing the top-ranked leaderboard team (2.7427) by 4.24%. Moreover, our comprehensive ablation experiments confirm that prompt-guided fusion and the simplified encoder-only design jointly enhance feature alignment and interpretability.

While ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for detecting thyroid nodules, its diagnostic accuracy is often limited by challenges such as low image contrast and blurred nodule boundaries. To address these issues, we propose Nodule-DETR, a novel detection transformer (DETR) architecture designed for robust thyroid nodule detection in ultrasound images. Nodule-DETR introduces three key innovations: a Multi-Spectral Frequency-domain Channel Attention (MSFCA) module that leverages frequency analysis to enhance features of low-contrast nodules; a Hierarchical Feature Fusion (HFF) module for efficient multi-scale integration; and Multi-Scale Deformable Attention (MSDA) to flexibly capture small and irregularly shaped nodules. We conducted extensive experiments on a clinical dataset of real-world thyroid ultrasound images. The results demonstrate that Nodule-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by a significant margin of 0.149 in mAP@0.5:0.95. The superior accuracy of Nodule-DETR highlights its significant potential for clinical application as an effective tool in computer-aided thyroid diagnosis.

This work presents a systematic empirical study of three weakly calibrated monocular strategies: landmark-based geometry, pose-driven regression, and object-calibrated silhouettes, evaluated under semi-constrained conditions using consumer-grade cameras. Rather than pursuing state-of-the-art accuracy, the study analyzes how differing calibration assumptions influence measurement behavior, robustness, and failure modes across varied body types.

Our key contribution is Deep Gaussian Shadow Maps (DGSM), a modern analogue of the classical shadow mapping algorithm tailored to the volumetric 3DGS representation. Building on the classic deep shadow mapping idea, we show that 3DGS admits closed form light accumulation along light rays, enabling volumetric shadow computation without meshing. For each estimated light, we tabulate transmittance over concentric radial shells and store them in octahedral atlases, which modern GPUs can sample in real time per query to attenuate affected scene Gaussians and thus cast and receive shadows consistently. To relight moving avatars, we approximate the local environment illumination with HDRI probes represented in a spherical harmonic (SH) basis and apply a fast per Gaussian radiance transfer, avoiding explicit BRDF estimation or offline optimization.

We introduce a general, model-agnostic methodology for injecting privileged information-such as bounding box masks, saliency maps, and depth cues-into deep learning-based object detectors through a teacher-student architecture. Experiments are conducted across five state-of-the-art object detection models and multiple public benchmarks, including UAV-based litter detection datasets and Pascal VOC 2012, to assess the impact on accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LUPI-trained students consistently outperform their baseline counterparts, achieving significant boosts in detection accuracy with no increase in inference complexity or model size. Performance improvements are especially marked for medium and large objects, while ablation studies reveal that intermediate weighting of teacher guidance optimally balances learning from privileged and standard inputs.

Existing refinement approaches either perform costly iterative re-generation or rely on vision-language models (VLMs) with weak spatial grounding, leading to semantic drift and unreliable local edits. To close this gap, we propose Agentic Retoucher, a hierarchical decision-driven framework that reformulates post-generation correction as a human-like perception-reasoning-action loop. Specifically, we design (1) a perception agent that learns contextual saliency for fine-grained distortion localization under text-image consistency cues, (2) a reasoning agent that performs human-aligned inferential diagnosis via progressive preference alignment, and (3) an action agent that adaptively plans localized inpainting guided by user preference.

Accurate wildfire risk prediction is hindered by the intrinsic stochasticity of ignition and spread and by nonlinear interactions among fuel conditions, meteorology, climate variability, topography, and human activities, challenging the reliability and interpretability of purely data-driven models. We propose a trustworthy data-driven wildfire risk prediction framework based on long-sequence, multi-scale temporal modeling, which integrates heterogeneous drivers while explicitly quantifying predictive uncertainty and enabling process-level interpretation. Evaluated over western Canada during the record-breaking 2023 and 2024 fire seasons, the proposed model outperforms existing time-series approaches, achieving an F1 score of 0.90 and a PR-AUC of 0.98 with low computational cost. Uncertainty-aware analysis reveals structured spatial and seasonal patterns in predictive confidence, highlighting increased uncertainty associated with ambiguous predictions and spatiotemporal decision boundaries. SHAP-based interpretation provides mechanistic understanding of wildfire controls, showing that temperature-related drivers dominate wildfire risk in both years, while moisture-related constraints play a stronger role in shaping spatial and land-cover-specific contrasts in 2024 compared to the widespread hot and dry conditions of 2023.

Progress in this area has been limited by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as pixel-level annotation is costly and time-consuming. To address this, recent methods leverage synthetic data or generate artificial change pairs, but out-of-domain generalization remains limited. In this work, we introduce a weak temporal supervision strategy that leverages additional temporal observations of existing single-temporal datasets, without requiring any new annotations. Specifically, we extend single-date remote sensing datasets with new observations acquired at different times and train a change detection model by assuming that real bi-temporal pairs mostly contain no change, while pairing images from different locations to generate change examples. To handle the inherent noise in these weak labels, we employ an object-aware change map generation and an iterative refinement process. We validate our approach on extended versions of the FLAIR and IAILD aerial datasets, achieving strong zero-shot and low-data regime performance across different benchmarks.

This study evaluates the performance of four deep learning-based face recognition models FaceNet, ArcFace, MagFace, and CosFace on a newly developed longitudinal dataset collected over a 24 month period in seven sessions involving children aged 0 to 3 years. Our analysis examines recognition accuracy across developmental stages, showing that the True Accept Rate (TAR) is only 30.7% at 0.1% False Accept Rate (FAR) for infants aged 0 to 6 months, due to unstable facial features. Performance improves significantly in older children, reaching 64.7% TAR at 0.1% FAR in the 2.5 to 3 year age group. We also evaluate verification performance over different time intervals, revealing that shorter time gaps result in higher accuracy due to reduced embedding drift. To mitigate this drift, we apply a Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) approach that improves TAR by over 12%, yielding features that are more temporally stable and generalizable. These findings are critical for building biometric systems that function reliably over time in smart city applications such as public healthcare, child safety, and digital identity services. The challenges observed in early age groups highlight the importance of future research on privacy preserving biometric authentication systems that can address temporal variability, particularly in secure and regulated urban environments where child verification is essential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u57280-3\u5c81\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5a74\u513f\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\uff080-6\u4e2a\u6708\u4ec530.7% TAR\uff09\uff0c\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u589e\u957f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff082.5-3\u5c81\u8fbe64.7% TAR\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528DANN\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u7279\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd12%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9762\u90e8\u5f62\u6001\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u7c7b\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u7eb5\u5411\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u6167\u57ce\u5e02\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u516c\u5171\u533b\u7597\u3001\u513f\u7ae5\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u670d\u52a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u5f00\u53d1\u76840-3\u5c81\u513f\u7ae5\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0824\u4e2a\u6708\u51857\u6b21\u91c7\u96c6\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff1aFaceNet\u3001ArcFace\u3001MagFace\u548cCosFace\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u53d1\u80b2\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DANN\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u7279\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "0-6\u4e2a\u6708\u5a74\u513f\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\uff08TAR\u4ec530.7% @ 0.1% FAR\uff09\uff0c\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u589e\u957f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c2.5-3\u5c81\u7ec4\u8fbe64.7% TAR\u3002\u8f83\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff08\u7279\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u8f83\u5c11\uff09\u3002DANN\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0cTAR\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d85\u8fc712%\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u589e\u957f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002DANN\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u7279\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u751f\u7269\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u513f\u7ae5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u7ba1\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Existing debiasing approaches often address a single modality either visual or textual leading to partial robustness and unstable adaptation under distribution shifts. We propose a bilateral prompt optimization framework (BiPrompt) that simultaneously mitigates non-causal feature reliance in both modalities during test-time adaptation. On the visual side, it employs structured attention-guided erasure to suppress background activations and enforce orthogonal prediction consistency between causal and spurious regions. On the textual side, it introduces balanced prompt normalization, a learnable re-centering mechanism that aligns class embeddings toward an isotropic semantic space. Together, these modules jointly minimize conditional mutual information between spurious cues and predictions, steering the model toward causal, domain invariant reasoning without retraining or domain supervision. Extensive evaluations on real-world and synthetic bias benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both average and worst-group accuracies over prior test-time debiasing methods, establishing a lightweight yet effective path toward trustworthy and causally grounded vision-language adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "BiPrompt\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u8fb9\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5904\u7406\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u6587\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u5206\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u8fb9\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff08BiPrompt\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u4fa7\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u64e6\u9664\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u533a\u57df\u548c\u865a\u5047\u533a\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u6b63\u4ea4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u6587\u672c\u4fa7\uff1a\u5f15\u5165\u5e73\u8861\u63d0\u793a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u7c7b\u522b\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5757\u5171\u540c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u865a\u5047\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u5408\u6210\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6700\u5dee\u7ec4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "BiPrompt\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u9886\u57df\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u3001\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

This work investigates whether synthetic face data can act as a longitudinal stabilizer by improving temporal robustness of child face recognition models. Using an identity disjoint protocol on the Young Face Aging (YFA) dataset, we evaluate three settings: (i) pretrained MagFace embeddings without dataset specific fine-tuning, (ii) MagFace fine-tuned using authentic training faces only, and (iii) MagFace fine-tuned using a combination of authentic and synthetically generated training faces. Synthetic data is generated using StyleGAN2 ADA and incorporated exclusively within the training identities; a post generation filtering step is applied to mitigate identity leakage and remove artifact affected samples. Experimental results across enrollment verification gaps from 6 to 36 months show that synthetic-augmented fine tuning substantially reduces error rates relative to both the pretrained baseline and real only fine tuning.

Existing LVSR methods often struggle to recover fine details due to limited contrast and insufficient high-frequency information. To overcome these challenges, we present RetinexEVSR, the first event-driven LVSR framework that leverages high-contrast event signals and Retinex-inspired priors to enhance video quality under low-light scenarios. Unlike previous approaches that directly fuse degraded signals, RetinexEVSR introduces a novel bidirectional cross-modal fusion strategy to extract and integrate meaningful cues from noisy event data and degraded RGB frames. Specifically, an illumination-guided event enhancement module is designed to progressively refine event features using illumination maps derived from the Retinex model, thereby suppressing low-light artifacts while preserving high-contrast details. Furthermore, we propose an event-guided reflectance enhancement module that utilizes the enhanced event features to dynamically recover reflectance details via a multi-scale fusion mechanism. Experimental results show that our RetinexEVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. Notably, on the SDSD benchmark, our method can get up to 2.95 dB gain while reducing runtime by 65% compared to prior event-based methods.

Submitted to CVPR 2026", "summary": "Roadside perception datasets are typically constructed via cooperative labeling between synchronized vehicle and roadside frame pairs. However, real deployment often requires annotation of roadside-only data due to hardware and privacy constraints. Even human experts struggle to produce accurate labels without vehicle-side data (image, LIDAR), which not only increases annotation difficulty and cost, but also reveals a fundamental learnability problem: many roadside-only scenes contain distant, blurred, or occluded objects whose 3D properties are ambiguous from a single view and can only be reliably annotated by cross-checking paired vehicle--roadside frames. We refer to such cases as inherently ambiguous samples. To reduce wasted annotation effort on inherently ambiguous samples while still obtaining high-performing models, we turn to active learning. This work focuses on active learning for roadside monocular 3D object detection and proposes a learnability-driven framework that selects scenes which are both informative and reliably labelable, suppressing inherently ambiguous samples while ensuring coverage. Experiments demonstrate that our method, LH3D, achieves 86.06%, 67.32%, and 78.67% of full-performance for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists respectively, using only 25% of the annotation budget on DAIR-V2X-I, significantly outperforming uncertainty-based baselines. This confirms that learnability, not uncertainty, matters for roadside 3D perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLH3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u65e2\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u53c8\u53ef\u53ef\u9760\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8def\u8fb9\u5355\u76ee3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u56fa\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752825%\u6807\u6ce8\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u6807\u6ce8\u8def\u8fb9\u5355\u76ee\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u573a\u666f\u5b58\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fdc\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u906e\u6321\u7684\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u51763D\u5c5e\u6027\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u770b\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8f66\u8f86-\u8def\u8fb9\u914d\u5bf9\u5e27\u624d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u6ce8\u56f0\u96be\u548c\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLH3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8def\u8fb9\u5355\u76ee3D\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u65e2\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u53c8\u53ef\u53ef\u9760\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u56fa\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6837\u672c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728DAIR-V2X-I\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752825%\u6807\u6ce8\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5bf9\u8f66\u8f86\u3001\u884c\u4eba\u548c\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u768486.06%\u300167.32%\u548c78.67%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8def\u8fb93D\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u800c\u975e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u624d\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0cLH3D\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u56fa\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Over the past year, the field has reached a new level, with dozens of open-source models released alongside highly capable commercial systems. However, only a limited number of open-source approaches currently achieve real-world quality. In addition, diffusion backbones, the dominant choice for these pipelines, are often large and computationally expensive for many deployments and research settings, with widely used variants typically containing 6B to 20B parameters. This paper presents a compact, high-throughput instruction-based image editing pipeline that uses a modern 2B-parameter Qwen3-VL model to guide the editing process and the 1.6B-parameter diffusion model Sana1.5 for image generation. Our design decisions across architecture, data processing, training configuration, and evaluation target low-cost inference and strict source consistency while maintaining high quality across the major edit categories feasible at this scale. Evaluated on the ImgEdit and GEdit benchmarks, the proposed method matches or exceeds the performance of substantially heavier baselines, including models with several times as many parameters and higher inference cost, and is particularly strong on edits that require preserving the input image, such as an attribute adjustment, object removal, background edits, and targeted replacement. The model fits within 24 GB of GPU memory and generates edited images at up to 2K resolution in approximately 4 seconds on an NVIDIA H100 in BF16, without additional inference optimizations or distillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f7f\u75282B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Qwen3-VL\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u914d\u54081.6B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Sana1.5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u9886\u57df\u867d\u7136\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u53c2\u6570\u5e9e\u5927\uff086B-20B\uff09\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u4f7f\u75282B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Qwen3-VL\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u5bfc\u5668\uff0c1.6B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Sana1.5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6e90\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImgEdit\u548cGEdit\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u6570\u500d\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5c5e\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u79fb\u9664\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u66ff\u6362\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u970024GB GPU\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u5728NVIDIA H100\u4e0a\u4ee5BF16\u7cbe\u5ea6\u751f\u62102K\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea64\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To overcome this, we propose an innovative Covariance Distribution Optimization (CDO) module specifically designed for efficient, real-time applications. The CDO module aligns lane feature distributions closely with ground-truth labels, significantly enhancing detection accuracy without increasing computational complexity. Evaluations were conducted on six diverse models across all three method categories, including two optimized for real-time applications and four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, tested comprehensively on three major datasets: CULane, TuSimple, and LLAMAS. Experimental results demonstrate accuracy improvements ranging from 0.01% to 1.5%.

This report presents a controlled comparison of these three paradigms across five real-world image classification datasets spanning road-surface defect recognition, agricultural variety identification, fruit/leaf disease recognition, pedestrian walkway encroachment recognition, and unauthorized vehicle recognition. Models are evaluated using accuracy and macro F1-score, complemented by efficiency metrics including training time per epoch and parameter counts. The results show that transfer learning consistently yields the strongest predictive performance, while the custom CNN provides an attractive efficiency--accuracy trade-off, especially when compute and memory budgets are constrained.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u62a5\u544a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdCNN\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578bCNN\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u901a\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u79cdCNN\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff1a\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9a\u5236CNN\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u3001\u6216\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1a\u8def\u9762\u7f3a\u9677\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u519c\u4e1a\u54c1\u79cd\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6c34\u679c/\u53f6\u7247\u75c5\u5bb3\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u4eba\u884c\u9053\u4fb5\u5360\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u672a\u6388\u6743\u8f66\u8f86\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a1) \u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u5b9a\u5236CNN\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5206\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4/epoch\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u7b49\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u59cb\u7ec8\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u5b9a\u5236CNN\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u6548\u7387-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4ecb\u4e8e\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u5b9a\u5236CNN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u7387-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We identify the root cause of this limitation as the inadequacy of current training datasets, which are often too short, low-resolution, and lack the task diversity required to teach robust temporal priors. To address this foundational data gap, we first introduce FFP-300K, a new large-scale dataset comprising 300K high-fidelity video pairs at 720p resolution and 81 frames in length, constructed via a principled two-track pipeline for diverse local and global edits. Building on this dataset, we propose a novel framework designed for true guidance-free FFP that resolves the critical tension between maintaining first-frame appearance and preserving source video motion. Architecturally, we introduce Adaptive Spatio-Temporal RoPE (AST-RoPE), which dynamically remaps positional encodings to disentangle appearance and motion references. At the objective level, we employ a self-distillation strategy where an identity propagation task acts as a powerful regularizer, ensuring long-term temporal stability and preventing semantic drift.

Full fine-tuning is computationally expensive and risks catastrophic forgetting. We propose \\textbf{TopoLoRA-SAM}, a topology-aware and parameter-efficient adaptation framework for binary semantic segmentation. TopoLoRA-SAM injects Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the frozen ViT encoder, augmented with a lightweight spatial convolutional adapter and optional topology-aware supervision via differentiable clDice. We evaluate our approach on five benchmarks spanning retinal vessel segmentation (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE\\_DB1), polyp segmentation (Kvasir-SEG), and SAR sea/land segmentation (SL-SSDD), comparing against U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, and Mask2Former. TopoLoRA-SAM achieves the best retina-average Dice and the best overall average Dice across datasets, while training only \\textbf{5.2\\%} of model parameters ($\\sim$4.9M). On the challenging CHASE\\_DB1 dataset, our method substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness, demonstrating that topology-aware parameter-efficient adaptation can match or exceed fully fine-tuned specialist models.

The submission includes 7 figures (fig1 to fig7) that visually support the technical analysis", "summary": "Masked autoencoders (MAE) have become a dominant paradigm in 3D representation learning, setting new performance benchmarks across various downstream tasks. Existing methods with fixed mask ratio neglect multi-level representational correlations and intrinsic geometric structures, while relying on point-wise reconstruction assumptions that conflict with the diversity of point cloud. To address these issues, we propose a 3D representation learning method, termed Point-SRA, which aligns representations through self-distillation and probabilistic modeling. Specifically, we assign different masking ratios to the MAE to capture complementary geometric and semantic information, while the MeanFlow Transformer (MFT) leverages cross-modal conditional embeddings to enable diverse probabilistic reconstruction. Our analysis further reveals that representations at different time steps in MFT also exhibit complementarity. Therefore, a Dual Self-Representation Alignment mechanism is proposed at both the MAE and MFT levels.

Achieving seamless conversational behavior, where speaking and listening states transition fluidly remains a key challenge. Existing 3D conversational avatar approaches rely on error-prone pseudo-3D labels that fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage framework MANGO, which leveraging pure image-level supervision by alternately training to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo-3D labels, thereby achieving better alignment with real-world conversational behaviors. Specifically, in the first stage, a diffusion-based transformer with a dual-audio interaction module models natural 3D motion from multi-speaker audio. In the second stage, we use a fast 3D Gaussian Renderer to generate high-fidelity images and provide 2D-level photometric supervision for the 3D motions through alternate training. Additionally, we introduce MANGO-Dialog, a high-quality dataset with over 50 hours of aligned 2D-3D conversational data across 500+ identities.

In collaboration with pathologists and guided by the the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Cancer Protocols, we design a Clinical Pathology Report Template (CPRT) that ensures comprehensive and standardized extraction of diagnostic elements from pathology reports. We validate the effectiveness of our pipeline on TCGA-BRCA. First, we extract pathological features from reports using CPRT. These features are then used to build CTIS-Align, a dataset of 80k slide-description pairs from 804 WSIs for vision-language alignment training, and CTIS-Bench, a rigorously curated VQA benchmark comprising 977 WSIs and 14,879 question-answer pairs. CTIS-Bench emphasizes clinically grounded, closed-ended questions (e.g., tumor grade, receptor status) that reflect real diagnostic workflows, minimize non-visual reasoning, and require genuine slide understanding. We further propose CTIS-QA, a Slide-level Question Answering model, featuring a dual-stream architecture that mimics pathologists' diagnostic approach. One stream captures global slide-level context via clustering-based feature aggregation, while the other focuses on salient local regions through attention-guided patch perception module. Extensive experiments on WSI-VQA, CTIS-Bench, and slide-level diagnostic tasks show that CTIS-QA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across multiple metrics.

Consequently, temporal forgery localization (TFL), which aims to precisely pinpoint tampered segments, becomes critical. However, existing methods are often constrained by \\emph{local view}, failing to capture global anomalies. To address this, we propose a \\underline{d}ual-stream graph learning and \\underline{d}isentanglement framework for temporal forgery localization (DDNet). By coordinating a \\emph{Temporal Distance Stream} for local artifacts and a \\emph{Semantic Content Stream} for long-range connections, DDNet prevents global cues from being drowned out by local smoothness. Furthermore, we introduce Trace Disentanglement and Adaptation (TDA) to isolate generic forgery fingerprints, alongside Cross-Level Feature Embedding (CLFE) to construct a robust feature foundation via deep fusion of hierarchical features.

Many parameter-efficient Video-LLMs rely on unconstrained bidirectional projectors to model inter-frame interactions, which can blur temporal ordering by allowing later frames to influence earlier representations, without explicit architectural mechanisms to respect the directional nature of video reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose V-CORE, a parameter-efficient framework that introduces explicit temporal ordering constraints for video understanding. V-CORE consists of two key components: (1) Learnable Spatial Aggregation (LSA), which adaptively selects salient spatial tokens to reduce redundancy, and (2) a Causality-Aware Temporal Projector (CATP), which enforces structured unidirectional information flow via block-causal attention and a terminal dynamic summary token acting as a causal sink. This design preserves intra-frame spatial interactions while ensuring that temporal information is aggregated in a strictly ordered manner. With 4-bit QLoRA and a frozen LLM backbone, V-CORE can be trained efficiently on a single consumer GPU. Experiments show that V-CORE achieves strong performance on the challenging NExT-QA benchmark, reaching 61.2% accuracy, and remains competitive across MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA, and TGIF-QA, with gains concentrated in temporal and causal reasoning subcategories (+3.5% and +5.2% respectively), directly validating the importance of explicit temporal ordering constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "V-CORE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u5408\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684Video-LLMs\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u5e27\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u6a21\u7cca\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5141\u8bb8\u540e\u7eed\u5e27\u5f71\u54cd\u5148\u524d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c0a\u91cd\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "V-CORE\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u5408(LSA)\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6807\u8bb0\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\uff1b2) \u56e0\u679c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u5668(CATP)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5757\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u6c47\u7684\u7ec8\u7aef\u52a8\u6001\u6458\u8981\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5355\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3002\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5e27\u5185\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u4e25\u683c\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684NExT-QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523061.2%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728MSVD-QA\u3001MSRVTT-QA\u548cTGIF-QA\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f97+3.5%\u548c+5.2%\u7684\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "V-CORE\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u5e8f\u805a\u5408\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

While some studies have addressed the generation of facial videos driven by emotional audio, efficiently generating high-quality talking head videos that integrate both emotional expressions and style features remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ESGaussianFace, an innovative framework for emotional and stylized audio-driven facial animation. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct 3D scenes and render videos, ensuring efficient generation of 3D consistent results. We propose an emotion-audio-guided spatial attention method that effectively integrates emotion features with audio content features. Through emotion-guided attention, the model is able to reconstruct facial details across different emotional states more accurately. To achieve emotional and stylized deformations of the 3D Gaussian points through emotion and style features, we introduce two 3D Gaussian deformation predictors.

While most existing methods focus on improving within-category anomaly scoring, practical deployments increasingly require task-agnostic operation under continual category expansion, where the category identity is unknown at test time. In this setting, overall performance is often dominated by expert selection, namely routing an input to an appropriate normality model before any head-specific scoring is applied. However, routing rules that compare head-specific anomaly scores across independently constructed heads are unreliable in practice, as score distributions can differ substantially across categories in scale and tail behavior.\n  We propose GCR, a lightweight mixture-of-experts framework for stabilizing task-agnostic continual anomaly detection through geometry-consistent routing. GCR routes each test image directly in a shared frozen patch-embedding space by minimizing an accumulated nearest-prototype distance to category-specific prototype banks, and then computes anomaly maps only within the routed expert using a standard prototype-based scoring rule. By separating cross-head decision making from within-head anomaly scoring, GCR avoids cross-head score comparability issues without requiring end-to-end representation learning.\n  Experiments on MVTec AD and VisA show that geometry-consistent routing substantially improves routing stability and mitigates continual performance collapse, achieving near-zero forgetting while maintaining competitive detection and localization performance. These results indicate that many failures previously attributed to representation forgetting can instead be explained by decision-rule instability in cross-head routing.

To address these issues, we propose a novel fusion approach named Entity-Guided Multi-Task learning for infrared and visible image fusion (EGMT). Our approach includes three key innovative components: (i) A principled method is proposed to extract entity-level textual information from image captions generated by large vision-language models, eliminating semantic noise from raw text while preserving critical semantic information; (ii) A parallel multi-task learning architecture is constructed, which integrates image fusion with a multi-label classification task. By using entities as pseudo-labels, the multi-label classification task provides semantic supervision, enabling the model to achieve a deeper understanding of image content and significantly improving the quality and semantic density of the fused image; (iii) An entity-guided cross-modal interactive module is also developed to facilitate the fine-grained interaction between visual and entity-level textual features, which enhances feature representation by capturing cross-modal dependencies at both inter-visual and visual-entity levels.

Most approaches rely on fixed output heads and bespoke tracking pipelines, making them difficult to extend to more complex or instruction-driven tasks. To address these limitations, we propose AR-MOT, a novel autoregressive paradigm that formulates MOT as a sequence generation task within a large language model (LLM) framework. This design enables the model to output structured results through flexible sequence construction, without requiring any task-specific heads. To enhance region-level visual perception, we introduce an Object Tokenizer based on a pretrained detector. To mitigate the misalignment between global and regional features, we propose a Region-Aware Alignment (RAA) module, and to support long-term tracking, we design a Temporal Memory Fusion (TMF) module that caches historical object tokens. AR-MOT offers strong potential for extensibility, as new modalities or instructions can be integrated by simply modifying the output sequence format without altering the model architecture.

With the development of continual learning, significant progress has been made in retaining knowledge and adapting to new information in the VQA domain. However, current methods often struggle with balancing knowledge retention, adaptation, and robust feature representation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework with adaptive memory allocation and global noise filtering called MacVQA for visual question answering. MacVQA fuses visual and question information while filtering noise to ensure robust representations, and employs prototype-based memory allocation to optimize feature quality and memory usage. These designs enable MacVQA to balance knowledge acquisition, retention, and compositional generalization in continual VQA learning. Experiments on ten continual VQA tasks show that MacVQA outperforms existing baselines, achieving 43.38% average accuracy and 2.32% average forgetting on standard tasks, and 42.53% average accuracy and 3.60% average forgetting on novel composition tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MacVQA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dVQA\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMacVQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u9c81\u68d2\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5206\u914d\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u6301\u7eedVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cMacVQA\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523043.38%\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c2.32%\u5e73\u5747\u9057\u5fd8\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523042.53%\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c3.60%\u5e73\u5747\u9057\u5fd8\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "MacVQA\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6301\u7eedVQA\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper concentrates on relieving this requirement via developing a coarse-to-fine normal estimator. Concretely, our method first trains a neat model from a small dataset to produce coarse face normals that perform as guidance (called exemplars) for the following refinement. A self-attention mechanism is employed to capture long-range dependencies, thus remedying severe local artifacts left in estimated coarse facial normals. Then, a refinement network is customized for the sake of mapping input face images together with corresponding exemplars to fine-grained high-quality facial normals.

However, transferring complex motions between videos remains challenging. In this work, we present MotionAdapter, a content-aware motion transfer framework that enables robust and semantically aligned motion transfer within DiT-based T2V models. Our key insight is that effective motion transfer requires \\romannumeral1) explicit disentanglement of motion from appearance and \\romannumeral 2) adaptive customization of motion to target content. MotionAdapter first isolates motion by analyzing cross-frame attention within 3D full-attention modules to extract attention-derived motion fields. To bridge the semantic gap between reference and target videos, we further introduce a DINO-guided motion customization module that rearranges and refines motion fields based on content correspondences. The customized motion field is then used to guide the DiT denoising process, ensuring that the synthesized video inherits the reference motion while preserving target appearance and semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionAdapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

However, due to language bias, LVLMs are susceptible to object hallucination, which can be primarily divided into category, attribute, and relation hallucination, significantly impeding the trustworthy AI applications. Editing the internal activations of LVLMs has shown promising effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations with minimal cost. However, previous editing approaches neglect the effective guidance offered by factual textual semantics, thereby struggling to explicitly mitigate language bias. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Factual-guided Visual-Textual Editing for hallucination mitigation (AFTER), which comprises Factual-Augmented Activation Steering (FAS) and Query-Adaptive Offset Optimization (QAO), to adaptively guides the original biased activations towards factual semantics. Specifically, FAS is proposed to provide factual and general guidance for activation editing, thereby explicitly modeling the precise visual-textual associations. Subsequently, QAO introduces a query-aware offset estimator to establish query-specific editing from the general steering vector, enhancing the diversity and granularity of editing. Extensive experiments on standard hallucination benchmarks across three widely adopted LVLMs validate the efficacy of the proposed AFTER, notably achieving up to a 16.3% reduction of hallucination over baseline on the AMBER benchmark.

However, existing CDMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when continuously learning new concepts. Most prior works attempt to mitigate this issue under the sequential learning setting with a fixed order of concept inflow and neglect inter-concept interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework - Forget Less by Learning Together (FL2T) - that enables concurrent and order-agnostic concept learning while addressing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we introduce a set-invariant inter-concept learning module where proxies guide feature selection across concepts, facilitating improved knowledge retention and transfer. By leveraging inter-concept guidance, our approach preserves old concepts while efficiently incorporating new ones.

Existing approaches either revisit local image patches, improving fine-grained perception but weakening global spatial awareness, or mark isolated coordinates, which capture object locations but overlook their overall organization. In this work, we integrate the cognitive concept of an object-centric blueprint into VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Given an image and a question, the model first constructs a JSON-style blueprint that records the positions, sizes, and attributes of relevant objects, and then reasons over this structured representation to produce the final answer. To achieve this, we introduce three key techniques: (1) blueprint-embedded reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning to elicit basic reasoning skills; (2) blueprint-aware rewards in reinforcement learning to encourage the blueprint to include an appropriate number of objects and to align final answers with this causal reasoning; and (3) anti-shortcut data augmentation that applies targeted perturbations to images and questions, discouraging reliance on superficial visual or linguistic cues.

Existing methods mainly address a single type of degradation (e.g., haze or low-light) at a time, ignoring the interplay of different degradation types and resulting in limited visibility improvement. We observe that the domain knowledge shared between low-light and haze priors can be reinforced mutually for better visibility. Based on this key insight, in this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances visibility in nighttime hazy images by reinforcing the intrinsic consistency between haze and low-light priors mutually and progressively. In particular, our model utilizes image-, patch-, and pixel-level experts that operate across visual and frequency domains to recover global scene structure, regional patterns, and fine-grained details progressively.

Nevertheless, their performance drops significantly on severely degraded, low-quality images, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose GleSAM++, which utilizes Generative Latent space Enhancement to boost robustness on low-quality images, thus enabling generalization across various image qualities. Additionally, to improve compatibility between the pre-trained diffusion model and the segmentation framework, we introduce two techniques, i.e., Feature Distribution Alignment (FDA) and Channel Replication and Expansion (CRE). However, the above components lack explicit guidance regarding the degree of degradation. The model is forced to implicitly fit a complex noise distribution that spans conditions from mild noise to severe artifacts, which substantially increases the learning burden and leads to suboptimal reconstructions. To address this issue, we further introduce a Degradation-aware Adaptive Enhancement (DAE) mechanism. The key principle of DAE is to decouple the reconstruction process for arbitrary-quality features into two stages: degradation-level prediction and degradation-aware reconstruction. Our method can be applied to pre-trained SAM and SAM2 with only minimal additional learnable parameters, allowing for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GleSAM++ significantly improves segmentation robustness on complex degradations while maintaining generalization to clear images.

Currently, depth foundation models, such as Depth Anything, achieve great success in ideal scenes but remain challenging under adverse imaging conditions such as extreme illumination and motion blur. These degradations corrupt the visual signals of frame cameras, weakening the discriminative features of frame-based depths across the spatial and temporal dimensions. Typically, existing approaches incorporate event cameras to leverage their high dynamic range and temporal resolution, aiming to compensate for corrupted frame features. However, such specialized fusion models are predominantly trained from scratch on domain-specific datasets, thereby failing to inherit the open-world knowledge and robust generalization inherent to foundation models. In this work, we propose ADAE, an event-guided spatiotemporal fusion framework for Depth Anything in degraded scenes. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1) Entropy-Aware Spatial Fusion. We adaptively merge frame-based and event-based features using an information entropy strategy to indicate illumination-induced degradation. 2) Motion-Guided Temporal Correction. We resort to the event-based motion cue to recalibrate ambiguous features in blurred regions. Under our unified framework, the two components are complementary to each other and jointly enhance Depth Anything under adverse imaging conditions.

Moreover, it supports open-vocabulary recognition, enabling users to detect objects using arbitrary text queries, thus overcoming the limitations of traditional supervised approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u97003D\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6216\u914d\u5bf9RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u76843D\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u76f8\u673a\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u6295\u5f71\u52302D\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u78402D\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u679c", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf3D\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u76843D\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u914d\u5bf9RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u97003D\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bc6\u522b", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u865a\u62df\u76f8\u673a\u5c063D\u70b9\u4e91\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u591a\u4e2a2D\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528\u57fa\u78402D\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c2D\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u805a\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b03D\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff1b4) \u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bc6\u522b", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u97003D\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u610f\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u68c0\u6d4b\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u9650\u5236", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d393D\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76843D\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Existing methods often rely on lightweight modules for fast feature extraction, which struggles to preserve structured patterns and fine-grained details, leading to texture attenuation during generation.To address these issues, we propose AlignVTOFF, a novel parallel U-Net framework built upon a Reference U-Net and Texture-Spatial Feature Alignment (TSFA). The Reference U-Net performs multi-scale feature extraction and enhances geometric fidelity, enabling robust modeling of deformation while retaining complex structured patterns. TSFA then injects the reference garment features into a frozen denoising U-Net via a hybrid attention design, consisting of a trainable cross-attention module and a frozen self-attention module. This design explicitly aligns texture and spatial cues and alleviates the loss of high-frequency information during the denoising process.Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate that AlignVTOFF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing flat-lay garment results with improved structural realism and high-frequency detail fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAlignVTOFF\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f(VTOFF)\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u6301\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884cU-Net\u548c\u7eb9\u7406-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u6848\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7eb9\u7406\u8870\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAlignVTOFF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53c2\u8003U-Net\u548c\u7eb9\u7406-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50(TSFA)\u3002\u53c2\u8003U-Net\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u589e\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0cTSFA\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c06\u53c2\u8003\u670d\u88c5\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u53bb\u566aU-Net\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAlignVTOFF\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7ed3\u6784\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u94fa\u670d\u88c5\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "AlignVTOFF\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5e76\u884cU-Net\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7eb9\u7406-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u6301\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, traditional biomechanical models are computationally expensive, while geometric deep learning approaches often lack interpretability. In this study, we develop and validate a physics-informed geometric deep learning framework named PhysSFI-Net for precise prediction of soft tissue deformation following orthognathic surgery. PhysSFI-Net consists of three components: a hierarchical graph module with craniofacial and surgical plan encoders combined with attention mechanisms to extract skeletal-facial interaction features; a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based sequential predictor for incremental soft tissue deformation; and a biomechanics-inspired module for high-resolution facial surface reconstruction. Model performance was assessed using point cloud shape error (Hausdorff distance), surface deviation error, and landmark localization error (Euclidean distances of craniomaxillofacial landmarks) between predicted facial shapes and corresponding ground truths. A total of 135 patients who underwent combined orthodontic and orthognathic treatment were included for model training and validation. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that PhysSFI-Net achieved a point cloud shape error of 1.070 +/- 0.088 mm, a surface deviation error of 1.296 +/- 0.349 mm, and a landmark localization error of 2.445 +/- 1.326 mm. Comparative experiments indicated that PhysSFI-Net outperformed the state-of-the-art method ACMT-Net in prediction accuracy.

This manuscript is under review at IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "summary": "Glacial segmentation is essential for reconstructing past glacier dynamics and evaluating climate-driven landscape change. However, weak optical contrast and the limited availability of high-resolution DEMs hinder automated mapping. This study introduces the first large-scale optical-only moraine segmentation dataset, comprising 3,340 manually annotated high-resolution images from Google Earth covering glaciated regions of Sichuan and Yunnan, China. We develop MCD-Net, a lightweight baseline that integrates a MobileNetV2 encoder, a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and a DeepLabV3+ decoder.

This paper presents a novel feed-forward 3DGS framework for 360 images, capable of generating geometrically consistent Gaussian primitives while maintaining high rendering quality. A Depth-Normal geometric regularization is introduced to couple rendered depth gradients with normal information, supervising Gaussian rotation, scale, and position to improve point cloud and surface accuracy.

However, a fundamental limitation persists: the deep entanglement of illumination and intrinsic appearance prevents controllable relighting. Existing disentanglement methods rely on strong assumptions to enable weakly supervised learning, which restricts their capacity for complex illumination. To address this challenge, we introduce HeadLighter, a novel supervised framework that learns a physically plausible decomposition of appearance and illumination in head generative models. Specifically, we design a dual-branch architecture that separately models lighting-invariant head attributes and physically grounded rendering components. A progressive disentanglement training is employed to gradually inject head appearance priors into the generative architecture, supervised by multi-view images captured under controlled light conditions with a light stage setup.

However, to our knowledge, the domain of two-person interactions, particularly in the context of martial arts combat, remains uncharted. We identify a significant gap: existing models for single-person dancing generation prove insufficient for capturing the subtleties and complexities of two engaged fighters, resulting in challenges such as identity confusion, anomalous limbs, and action mismatches. To address this, we introduce a pioneering new task, Personalized Martial Arts Combat Video Generation. Our approach, MagicFight, is specifically crafted to overcome these hurdles. Given this pioneering task, we face a lack of appropriate datasets. Thus, we generate a bespoke dataset using the game physics engine Unity, meticulously crafting a multitude of 3D characters, martial arts moves, and scenes designed to represent the diversity of combat. MagicFight refines and adapts existing models and strategies to generate high-fidelity two-person combat videos that maintain individual identities and ensure seamless, coherent action sequences, thereby laying the groundwork for future innovations in the realm of interactive video content creation.\n  Website: https://MingfuYAN.github.io/MagicFight/\n  Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MingfuYAN/KungFu-Fiesta", "AI": {"tldr": "MagicFight\u63d0\u51fa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53cc\u4eba\u6b66\u672f\u683c\u6597\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Unity\u751f\u6210\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4eba\u821e\u8e48\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cc\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u6df7\u6dc6\u3001\u80a2\u4f53\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5355\u4eba\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u800c\u53cc\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6b66\u672f\u683c\u6597\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4eba\u821e\u8e48\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4e24\u540d\u683c\u6597\u8005\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8eab\u4efd\u6df7\u6dc6\u3001\u80a2\u4f53\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Unity\u6e38\u620f\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u751f\u6210\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76843D\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u6b66\u672f\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u573a\u666f\u3002MagicFight\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u6301\u4e2a\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53cc\u4eba\u683c\u6597\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u53cc\u4eba\u683c\u6597\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e2a\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "MagicFight\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6b66\u672f\u683c\u6597\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53cc\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Springer, Cham", "summary": "The automotive industry's pursuit of enhanced fuel economy and performance necessitates efficient aerodynamic design. However, traditional evaluation methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel testing are resource intensive, hindering rapid iteration in the early design stages. Machine learning-based surrogate models offer a promising alternative, yet many existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, limited interpretability, or insufficient accuracy for detailed geometric inputs. This paper introduces a novel lightweight surrogate model for the prediction of the aerodynamic drag coefficient (Cd) based on a sequential slice-wise processing of the geometry of the 3D vehicle. Inspired by medical imaging, 3D point clouds of vehicles are decomposed into an ordered sequence of 2D cross-sectional slices along the stream-wise axis. Each slice is encoded by a lightweight PointNet2D module, and the sequence of slice embeddings is processed by a bidirectional LSTM to capture longitudinal geometric evolution. The model, trained and evaluated on the DrivAerNet++ dataset, achieves a high coefficient of determination (R^2 > 0.9528) and a low mean absolute error (MAE approx 6.046 x 10^{-3}) in Cd prediction. With an inference time of approximately 0.025 seconds per sample on a consumer-grade GPU, our approach provides fast, accurate, and interpretable aerodynamic feedback, facilitating more agile and informed automotive design exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u5207\u7247\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b3D\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u7a7a\u6c14\u963b\u529b\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a2D\u622a\u9762\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PointNet2D\u548c\u53cc\u5411LSTM\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c7d\u8f66\u884c\u4e1a\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edfCFD\u548c\u98ce\u6d1e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u65e9\u671f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u6216\u5bf9\u8be6\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u8f93\u5165\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c063D\u8f66\u8f86\u70b9\u4e91\u6cbf\u6d41\u5411\u8f74\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6709\u5e8f2D\u622a\u9762\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5207\u7247\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7PointNet2D\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e8f\u5217\u5d4c\u5165\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411LSTM\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7eb5\u5411\u51e0\u4f55\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728DrivAerNet++\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u51b3\u5b9a\u7cfb\u6570\uff08R^2 > 0.9528\uff09\u548c\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAE \u2248 6.046\u00d710^{-3}\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea60.025\u79d2/\u6837\u672c\uff08\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u654f\u6377\u548c\u77e5\u60c5\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has become a key tool for large-scale oil spill monitoring, most existing detection methods rely on deep learning-based segmentation applied to single SAR images. These static approaches struggle to distinguish true oil spills from visually similar oceanic features (e.g., biogenic slicks or low-wind zones), leading to high false positive rates and limited generalizability, especially under data-scarce conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Oil Spill Change Detection (OSCD), a new bi-temporal task that focuses on identifying changes between pre- and post-spill SAR images. As real co-registered pre-spill imagery is not always available, we propose the Temporal-Aware Hybrid Inpainting (TAHI) framework, which generates synthetic pre-spill images from post-spill SAR data. TAHI integrates two key components: High-Fidelity Hybrid Inpainting for oil-free reconstruction, and Temporal Realism Enhancement for radiometric and sea-state consistency. Using TAHI, we construct the first OSCD dataset and benchmark several state-of-the-art change detection models.

We systematically evaluate six diverse signal separation methods (FastICA, SOBI, PCA, NMF, Wavelet, Tensor Decomposition) across seven scenarios with 1-10 people using commodity ESP32 WiFi sensors--a simple, low-cost, off-the-shelf solution. Through novel diagnostic metrics (intra-subject variability, inter-subject distinguishability, performance degradation rate), we reveal that all methods achieve similarly low accuracy (45-56\\%, $\u03c3$=3.74\\%) with statistically insignificant differences (p $>$ 0.05). Even the best-performing method, NMF, achieves only 56\\% accuracy.

While deep architectures achieve high accuracy on benchmarks like CUB-200-2011, their computational cost is often prohibitive. Conversely, shallow networks (e.g., AlexNet, VGG) offer efficiency but fail to distinguish visually similar sub-categories. This is because standard Global Average Pooling (GAP) heads capture only first-order statistics, missing the subtle high-order feature interactions required for FGVC. While Bilinear CNNs address this, they suffer from high feature dimensionality and instability during training. To bridge this gap, we propose the Quantum-inspired Interaction Classifier (QuIC). Drawing inspiration from quantum mechanics, QuIC models feature channels as interacting quantum states and captures second-order feature covariance via a learnable observable operator. Designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module, QuIC supports stable, single-stage end-to-end training without exploding feature dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that QuIC significantly revitalizes shallow backbones: it boosts the Top-1 accuracy of VGG16 by nearly 20% and outperforms state-of-the-art attention mechanisms (SE-Block) on ResNet18. Qualitative analysis, including t-SNE visualization, further confirms that QuIC resolves ambiguous cases by explicitly attending to fine-grained discriminative features and enforcing compact intra-class clustering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u7c7b\u5668QuIC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u9053\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5e76\u6355\u6349\u4e8c\u9636\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6d45\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6df1\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u6d45\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5982AlexNet\u3001VGG\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u5168\u5c40\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u53ea\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u4e00\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027CNN\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u7c7b\u5668QuIC\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b97\u5b50\u6355\u6349\u4e8c\u9636\u7279\u5f81\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u3002QuIC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7206\u70b8\u3002", "result": "QuIC\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d45\u5c42\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u5c06VGG16\u7684Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8fd120%\uff0c\u5728ResNet18\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08SE-Block\uff09\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5305\u62ect-SNE\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff09\u8bc1\u5b9eQuIC\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5173\u6ce8\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5224\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7c7b\u5185\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "QuIC\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6d45\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Yet, the performance of pathology foundation models across magnifications and the effect of magnification sampling during training remain poorly understood. We model magnification sampling as a multi-source domain adaptation problem and develop a simple theoretical framework that reveals systematic trade-offs between sampling strategies. We show that the widely used discrete uniform sampling of magnifications (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mpp) leads to degradation at intermediate magnifications. We introduce continuous magnification sampling, which removes gaps in magnification coverage while preserving performance at standard scales. Further, we derive sampling distributions that optimize representation quality across magnification scales. To evaluate these strategies, we introduce two new benchmarks (TCGA-MS, BRACS-MS) with appropriate metrics. Our experiments show that continuous sampling substantially improves over discrete sampling at intermediate magnifications, with gains of up to 4 percentage points in balanced classification accuracy, and that optimized distributions can further improve performance. Finally, we evaluate current histopathology foundation models, finding that magnification is a primary driver of performance variation across models.

However, practical deployment is severely hampered by the domain shift problem, where models trained in one environment fail to generalise to another. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage framework centred on a CSI-ResNet-A architecture. This model is pre-trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to learn domain-invariant representations and leverages lightweight Adapter modules for highly efficient fine-tuning. The resulting event sequence is then processed by a stateful counting machine to produce a final, stable occupancy estimate. We validate our framework extensively. On our WiFlow dataset, our unsupervised approach excels in a 10-shot learning scenario, achieving a final Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of just 0.44--a task where supervised baselines fail. To formally quantify robustness, we introduce the Generalisation Index (GI), on which our model scores near-perfectly, confirming its ability to generalise. Furthermore, our framework sets a new state-of-the-art public WiAR benchmark with 98.8\\% accuracy. Our ablation studies reveal the core strength of our design: adapter-based fine-tuning achieves performance within 1\\% of a full fine-tune (98.84\\% vs. 99.67\\%) while training 97.2\\% fewer parameters.

To understand the internal mechanism of MMDiT-based models, existing methods tried to analyze the effect of specific components like positional encoding and attention layers. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of how different blocks and their interactions with textual conditions contribute to the synthesis process remains elusive. In this paper, we first develop a systematic pipeline to comprehensively investigate each block's functionality by removing, disabling and enhancing textual hidden-states at corresponding blocks. Our analysis reveals that 1) semantic information appears in earlier blocks and finer details are rendered in later blocks, 2) removing specific blocks is usually less disruptive than disabling text conditions, and 3) enhancing textual conditions in selective blocks improves semantic attributes. Building on these observations, we further propose novel training-free strategies for improved text alignment, precise editing, and acceleration.

However, this task remains challenging due to irregular nodule shapes, indistinct boundaries, substantial scale variations, and the presence of speckle noise that degrades structural visibility. To address these challenges, we propose a prior-guided DETR framework specifically designed for ultrasound nodule detection. Instead of relying on purely data-driven feature learning, the proposed framework progressively incorporates different prior knowledge at multiple stages of the network. First, a Spatially-adaptive Deformable FFN with Prior Regularization (SDFPR) is embedded into the CNN backbone to inject geometric priors into deformable sampling, stabilizing feature extraction for irregular and blurred nodules. Second, a Multi-scale Spatial-Frequency Feature Mixer (MSFFM) is designed to extract multi-scale structural priors, where spatial-domain processing emphasizes contour continuity and boundary cues, while frequency-domain modeling captures global morphology and suppresses speckle noise. Furthermore, a Dense Feature Interaction (DFI) mechanism propagates and exploits these prior-modulated features across all encoder layers, enabling the decoder to enhance query refinement under consistent geometric and structural guidance. Experiments conducted on two clinically collected thyroid ultrasound datasets (Thyroid I and Thyroid II) and two public benchmarks (TN3K and BUSI) for thyroid and breast nodules demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy compared with 18 detection methods, particularly in detecting morphologically complex nodules.The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjj1wjj/Ultrasound-DETR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684DETR\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u58f0\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6ce8\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u548c\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u58f0\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u548c\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u7ed3\u8282\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u4ee5\u53ca\u6591\u70b9\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684DETR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) SDFPR\u6a21\u5757\u5728CNN\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u7ed3\u8282\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b2) MSFFM\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u5f3a\u8c03\u8f6e\u5ed3\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u9891\u57df\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u5f62\u6001\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\uff1b3) DFI\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u4f20\u64ad\u5148\u9a8c\u8c03\u5236\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6(Thyroid I\u548cThyroid II)\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6(TN3K\u548cBUSI)\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e0e18\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfcDETR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6ce8\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d85\u58f0\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u548c\u4e73\u817a\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

While recent adapter-based approaches efficiently transfer RGB-pretrained foundation models to this task, they often prioritize model efficiency at the expense of cross-modal structural consistency. Consequently, critical structural cues are frequently lost when significant domain gaps arise, such as in high-contrast or nighttime environments. Moreover, conventional static multimodal fusion mechanisms typically lack environmental awareness, resulting in suboptimal adaptation and constrained detection performance under complex, dynamic scene variations. To address these limitations, we propose SLGNet, a parameter-efficient framework that synergizes hierarchical structural priors and language-guided modulation within a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model. Specifically, we design a Structure-Aware Adapter to extract hierarchical structural representations from both modalities and dynamically inject them into the ViT to compensate for structural degradation inherent in ViT-based backbones. Furthermore, we propose a Language-Guided Modulation module that exploits VLM-driven structured captions to dynamically recalibrate visual features, thereby endowing the model with robust environmental awareness. Extensive experiments on the LLVIP, FLIR, KAIST, and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that SLGNet establishes new state-of-the-art performance.

In this paper, we propose DiffProxy, a novel framework that generates multi-view consistent human proxies for mesh recovery. Central to DiffProxy is leveraging the diffusion-based generative priors to bridge the synthetic training and real-world generalization. Its key innovations include: (1) a multi-conditional mechanism for generating multi-view consistent, pixel-aligned human proxies; (2) a hand refinement module that incorporates flexible visual prompts to enhance local details; and (3) an uncertainty-aware test-time scaling method that increases robustness to challenging cases during optimization. These designs ensure that the mesh recovery process effectively benefits from the precise synthetic ground truth and generative advantages of the diffusion-based pipeline. Trained entirely on synthetic data, DiffProxy achieves state-of-the-art performance across five real-world benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization particularly on challenging scenarios with occlusions and partial views.

While offline models like VGGT achieve inspiring geometry capability, their batch-based nature renders them irrelevant for live systems. Streaming architectures, though the intended solution for live operation, have proven inadequate. Existing methods either fail to support truly infinite-horizon inputs or suffer from catastrophic drift over long sequences. We shatter this long-standing dilemma with InfiniteVGGT, a causal visual geometry transformer that operationalizes the concept of a rolling memory through a bounded yet adaptive and perpetually expressive KV cache. Capitalizing on this, we devise a training-free, attention-agnostic pruning strategy that intelligently discards obsolete information, effectively ``rolling'' the memory forward with each new frame. Fully compatible with FlashAttention, InfiniteVGGT finally alleviates the compromise, enabling infinite-horizon streaming while outperforming existing streaming methods in long-term stability. The ultimate test for such a system is its performance over a truly infinite horizon, a capability that has been impossible to rigorously validate due to the lack of extremely long-term, continuous benchmarks. To address this critical gap, we introduce the Long3D benchmark, which, for the first time, enables a rigorous evaluation of continuous 3D geometry estimation on sequences about 10,000 frames. This provides the definitive evaluation platform for future research in long-term 3D geometry understanding.

However, applying SSL to multispectral remote sensing (RS) images presents unique challenges and opportunities due to the geographical and temporal variability of the data. In this paper, we introduce GeoRank, a novel regularization method for contrastive SSL that improves upon prior techniques by directly optimizing spherical distances to embed geographical relationships into the learned feature space. GeoRank outperforms or matches prior methods that integrate geographical metadata and consistently improves diverse contrastive SSL algorithms (e.g., BYOL, DINO). Beyond this, we present a systematic investigation of key adaptations of contrastive SSL for multispectral RS images, including the effectiveness of data augmentations, the impact of dataset cardinality and image size on performance, and the task dependency of temporal views.

Manual waste sorting is a common practice; however, it remains inefficient for handling large-scale waste streams and presents health risks for workers. On the other hand, existing automated sorting approaches still struggle with the high variability, clutter, and visual complexity of real-world waste streams. The lack of real-world datasets for waste sorting is a major reason automated systems for this problem are underdeveloped. Accordingly, we introduce SortWaste, a densely annotated object detection dataset collected from a Material Recovery Facility. Additionally, we contribute to standardizing waste detection in sorting lines by proposing ClutterScore, an objective metric that gauges the scene's hardness level using a set of proxies that affect visual complexity (e.g., object count, class and size entropy, and spatial overlap). In addition to these contributions, we provide an extensive benchmark of state-of-the-art object detection models, detailing their results with respect to the hardness level assessed by the proposed metric. Despite achieving promising results (mAP of 59.7% in the plastic-only detection task), performance significantly decreases in highly cluttered scenes.

Received by RA-L", "summary": "Monocular omnidirectional visual odometry (OVO) systems leverage 360-degree cameras to overcome field-of-view limitations of perspective VO systems. However, existing methods, reliant on handcrafted features or photometric objectives, often lack robustness in challenging scenarios, such as aggressive motion and varying illumination. To address this, we present 360DVO, the first deep learning-based OVO framework. Our approach introduces a distortion-aware spherical feature extractor (DAS-Feat) that adaptively learns distortion-resistant features from 360-degree images. These sparse feature patches are then used to establish constraints for effective pose estimation within a novel omnidirectional differentiable bundle adjustment (ODBA) module. To facilitate evaluation in realistic settings, we also contribute a new real-world OVO benchmark. Extensive experiments on this benchmark and public synthetic datasets (TartanAir V2 and 360VO) demonstrate that 360DVO surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (including 360VO and OpenVSLAM), improving robustness by 50% and accuracy by 37.5%.

However, in case of flood mapping using Sen1Flood11 dataset as a downstream task, GFMs struggles to outperform the baseline U-Net, highlighting model's limitation in capturing critical local nuances. To address this, we present the Prithvi-Complementary Adaptive Fusion Encoder (CAFE), which integrate Prithvi GFM pretrained encoder with a parallel CNN residual branch enhanced by Convolutional Attention Modules (CAM). Prithvi-CAFE enables fast and efficient fine-tuning through adapters in Prithvi and performs multi-scale, multi-level fusion with CNN features, capturing critical local details while preserving long-range dependencies. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two comprehensive flood mapping datasets: Sen1Flood11 and FloodPlanet. On Sen1Flood11 test data, Prithvi-CAFE (IoU 83.41) outperforms the original Prithvi (IoU 82.50) and other major GFMs (TerraMind 82.90, DOFA 81.54, spectralGPT: 81.02). The improvement is even more pronounced on the hold-out test site, where Prithvi-CAFE achieves an IoU of 81.37 compared to the baseline U-Net (70.57) and original Prithvi (72.42). On FloodPlanet, Prithvi-CAFE also surpasses the baseline U-Net and other GFMs, achieving an IoU of 64.70 compared to U-Net (60.14), Terramind (62.33), DOFA (59.15) and Prithvi 2.0 (61.91). Our proposed simple yet effective Prithvi-CAFE demonstrates strong potential for improving segmentation tasks where multi-channel and multi-modal data provide complementary information and local details are critical.

However, contactless images often show degraded ridge clarity due to illumination variation, subcutaneous skin discoloration, and specular reflections. Flash captures preserve ridge detail but introduce noise, whereas non-flash captures reduce noise but lower ridge contrast. We propose Fusion2Print (F2P), the first framework to systematically capture and fuse paired flash-non-flash contactless fingerprints. We construct a custom paired dataset, FNF Database, and perform manual flash-non-flash subtraction to isolate ridge-preserving signals. A lightweight attention-based fusion network also integrates both modalities, emphasizing informative channels and suppressing noise, and then a U-Net enhancement module produces an optimally weighted grayscale image. Finally, a deep embedding model with cross-domain compatibility, generates discriminative and robust representations in a unified embedding space compatible with both contactless and contact-based fingerprints for verification.

The central thesis proposes that learning, across physical, biological, and computational systems, fundamentally constitutes the conversion of flux into structure through entropy export. Building on Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures, we establish a formal isomorphism between thermodynamic processes and Bayesian updating, demonstrating that sustainable learning systems must follow dissipative patterns where crystallized posteriors become priors for subsequent levels of emergence.\n  We derive fundamental mathematical constants (e, \u03c0, \u03c6) as fixed points of Bayesian inference under minimal axioms, suggesting these constants emerge necessarily from any system capable of representing and updating uncertainty. Furthermore, we propose a conjecture linking G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems to thermodynamic constraints, hypothesizing that pathologies of formal systems (incompleteness, undecidability) are structurally analogous to dissipation deficits in physical systems.\n  As practical validation, we present a peer-to-peer network architecture implementing BEDS principles, achieving six orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing distributed consensus systems while enabling continuous learning.

However, these methods often treat the semantic and rendering branches separately, relying solely on 2D supervision while ignoring the 3D Gaussian geometry. Moreover, current adaptive strategies adapt the Gaussian set depending solely on rendering gradients, which can be insufficient in subtle or textureless regions. In this work, we propose a joint enhancement framework for 3D semantic Gaussian modeling that synergizes both semantic and rendering branches. Firstly, unlike conventional point cloud shape encoding, we introduce an anisotropic 3D Gaussian Chebyshev descriptor using the Laplace-Beltrami operator to capture fine-grained 3D shape details, thereby distinguishing objects with similar appearances and reducing reliance on potentially noisy 2D guidance. In addition, without relying solely on rendering gradient, we adaptively adjust Gaussian allocation and spherical harmonics with local semantic and shape signals, enhancing rendering efficiency through selective resource allocation. Finally, we employ a cross-scene knowledge transfer module to continuously update learned shape patterns, enabling faster convergence and robust representations without relearning shape information from scratch for each new scene.

Furthermore, collecting thousands of labeled disease images for training is both expensive and time-consuming. This paper addresses both challenges by combining neural network pruning -- removing unnecessary parts of the model -- with few-shot learning, which enables the model to learn from limited examples.

Spatially manipulating objects in a scene through natural language poses a challenge for multimodal generation systems. While existing text-based manipulation methods can adjust appearance or style, they struggle to perform object-level geometric transformations-such as translating, rotating, or resizing objects-due to scarce paired supervision and pixel-level optimization limits. Talk2Move employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explore geometric actions through diverse rollouts generated from input images and lightweight textual variations, removing the need for costly paired data. A spatial reward guided model aligns geometric transformations with linguistic description, while off-policy step evaluation and active step sampling improve learning efficiency by focusing on informative transformation stages. Furthermore, we design object-centric spatial rewards that evaluate displacement, rotation, and scaling behaviors directly, enabling interpretable and coherent transformations. Experiments on curated benchmarks demonstrate that Talk2Move achieves precise, consistent, and semantically faithful object transformations, outperforming existing text-guided editing approaches in both spatial accuracy and scene coherence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Talk2Move\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5916\u89c2\u6216\u98ce\u683c\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6267\u884c\u7269\u4f53\u7ea7\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u79fb\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u7f29\u653e\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5305\u62ec\u914d\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u53d8\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316rollout\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u51e0\u4f55\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5956\u52b1\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f4d\u79fb\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTalk2Move\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Talk2Move\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u7269\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling a broad range of visual creation and editing tasks under one model. Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens, and then used to guide the diffusion process. This design supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content, while avoiding modality-specific architectural components. To train such a unified system, we introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified, multi-task generator capable of both image and video input and output. Across diverse generation and editing benchmarks, VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits. Our results highlight a practical path toward scalable unified visual generation, and the promise of interleaved, in-context computation as a foundation for general-purpose visual creation.", "AI": {"tldr": "VINO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u6267\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6269\u6563\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002VINO\u65e8\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "VINO\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08MMDiT\uff09\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u4ea4\u9519\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cVINO\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u8eab\u4efd\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "VINO\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ea4\u9519\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u521b\u5efa\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Current state-of-the-art approaches fail to generalize to unseen manipulations, as they primarily rely on supervised training with existing deepfakes or pseudo-fakes, which leads to overfitting to specific forgery patterns. In contrast, self-supervised methods offer greater potential for generalization, but existing work struggles to learn discriminative representations only from self-supervision. In this paper, we propose ExposeAnyone, a fully self-supervised approach based on a diffusion model that generates expression sequences from audio. The key idea is, once the model is personalized to specific subjects using reference sets, it can compute the identity distances between suspected videos and personalized subjects via diffusion reconstruction errors, enabling person-of-interest face forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.22 percentage points in the average AUC on DF-TIMIT, DFDCP, KoDF, and IDForge datasets, 2) our model is also capable of detecting Sora2-generated videos, where the previous approaches perform poorly, and 3) our method is highly robust to corruptions such as blur and compression, highlighting the applicability in real-world face forgery detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "ExposeAnyone\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8868\u60c5\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6269\u6563\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u4f2a\u9020\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u4f2a\u9020\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u77e5\u4f2a\u9020\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4ec5\u4ece\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5224\u522b\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684ExposeAnyone\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8868\u60c5\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b2\uff09\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4e3b\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u8ba1\u7b97\u7591\u4f3c\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u5728DF-TIMIT\u3001DFDCP\u3001KoDF\u548cIDForge\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747AUC\u6bd4\u5148\u524dSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53474.22\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b2\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4bSora2\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u800c\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b3\uff09\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u7b49\u635f\u574f\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ExposeAnyone\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}
