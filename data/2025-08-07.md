Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: CIENS数据集提供德国气象局的集合天气预报数据，包含55个气象变量的预测和6个关键变量的观测数据，时间跨度长，适用于多种研究应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为天气和气候建模提供基准数据集，支持研究预报方法如何适应模型更新。

Method: 数据集包含集合天气预报和站点观测数据，时间跨度为2010年12月至2023年6月，覆盖德国170个站点。

Result: 数据集格式便于分析，支持集合后处理、预报验证等研究。

Conclusion: CIENS数据集为天气建模研究提供了丰富资源，并通过案例展示了机器学习预报模型的潜力。

Abstract: We present the CIENS dataset, which contains ensemble weather forecasts from
the operational convection-permitting numerical weather prediction model of the
German Weather Service. It comprises forecasts for 55 meteorological variables
mapped to the locations of synoptic stations, as well as additional spatially
aggregated forecasts from surrounding grid points, available for a subset of
these variables. Forecasts are available at hourly lead times from 0 to 21
hours for two daily model runs initialized at 00 and 12 UTC, covering the
period from December 2010 to June 2023. Additionally, the dataset provides
station observations for six key variables at 170 locations across Germany:
pressure, temperature, hourly precipitation accumulation, wind speed, wind
direction, and wind gusts. Since the forecast are mapped to the observed
locations, the data is delivered in a convenient format for analysis. The CIENS
dataset complements the growing collection of benchmark datasets for weather
and climate modeling. A key distinguishing feature is its long temporal extent,
which encompasses multiple updates to the underlying numerical weather
prediction model and thus supports investigations into how forecasting methods
can account for such changes. In addition to detailing the design and contents
of the CIENS dataset, we outline potential applications in ensemble
post-processing, forecast verification, and related research areas. A use case
focused on ensemble post-processing illustrates the benefits of incorporating
the rich set of available model predictors into machine learning-based
forecasting models.

### [2] [GP and LLMs for Program Synthesis: No Clear Winners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03966)
*Jose Guadalupe Hernandez,Anil Kumar Saini,Gabriel Ketron,Jason H. Moore*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 比较了PushGP和GPT-4o在程序合成任务中的表现，发现结合文本描述和输入输出示例（data-text）效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨遗传编程（GP）和大语言模型（LLMs）在程序合成任务中的差异及优化技术的重要性。

Method: 使用PSB2基准任务，对比PushGP和GPT-4o在不同提示（data-only、text-only、data-text）下的表现，并分析程序相似性。

Result: PushGP和GPT-4o结合data-text提示解决了最多任务（23/25），但某些任务仅由单一方法解决。

Conclusion: 不同优化技术（PushGP和LLMs）在程序合成中各有优势，需结合使用。

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) and large language models (LLMs) differ in how
program specifications are provided: GP uses input-output examples, and LLMs
use text descriptions. In this work, we compared the ability of PushGP and
GPT-4o to synthesize computer programs for tasks from the PSB2 benchmark suite.
We used three prompt variants with GPT-4o: input-output examples (data-only),
textual description of the task (text-only), and a combination of both textual
descriptions and input-output examples (data-text). Additionally, we varied the
number of input-output examples available for building programs. For each
synthesizer and task combination, we compared success rates across all program
synthesizers, as well as the similarity between successful GPT-4o synthesized
programs. We found that the combination of PushGP and GPT-4o with data-text
prompting led to the greatest number of tasks solved (23 of the 25 tasks), even
though several tasks were solved exclusively by only one of the two
synthesizers. We also observed that PushGP and GPT-4o with data-only prompting
solved fewer tasks with the decrease in the training set size, while the
remaining synthesizers saw no decrease. We also detected significant
differences in similarity between the successful programs synthesized for
GPT-4o with text-only and data-only prompting. With there being no dominant
program synthesizer, this work highlights the importance of different
optimization techniques used by PushGP and LLMs to synthesize programs.

### [3] [STARE: Predicting Decision Making Based on Spatio-Temporal Eye Movements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04148)
*Moshe Unger,Alexander Tuzhilin,Michel Wedel*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STARE的深度学习架构，用于从眼动时间序列预测消费者选择行为，填补了该领域基础模型的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏从原始眼动数据预测消费者行为的基础模型，因此需要开发一种能够捕捉眼动时空特征的架构。

Method: STARE采用新的标记化策略，将眼动坐标映射到预定义的感兴趣区域，并利用基于T5架构的Chronos模型，结合注意力机制捕捉眼动的时空特征。

Result: 在多个数据集上，STARE的表现优于现有方法，能够有效预测消费者选择行为。

Conclusion: STARE为基于眼动神经生理学的视觉注意力动态建模提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: The present work proposes a Deep Learning architecture for the prediction of
various consumer choice behaviors from time series of raw gaze or eye fixations
on images of the decision environment, for which currently no foundational
models are available. The architecture, called STARE (Spatio-Temporal Attention
Representation for Eye Tracking), uses a new tokenization strategy, which
involves mapping the x- and y- pixel coordinates of eye-movement time series on
predefined, contiguous Regions of Interest. That tokenization makes the
spatio-temporal eye-movement data available to the Chronos, a time-series
foundation model based on the T5 architecture, to which co-attention and/or
cross-attention is added to capture directional and/or interocular influences
of eye movements. We compare STARE with several state-of-the art alternatives
on multiple datasets with the purpose of predicting consumer choice behaviors
from eye movements. We thus make a first step towards developing and testing DL
architectures that represent visual attention dynamics rooted in the
neurophysiology of eye movements.

### [4] [TDSNNs: Competitive Topographic Deep Spiking Neural Networks for Visual Cortex Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04270)
*Deming Zhou,Yuetong Fang,Zhaorui Wang,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络（SNN）的时空约束损失函数（STC），用于构建地形深度脉冲神经网络（TDSNN），成功模拟了灵长类视觉皮层的功能组织，并在性能和生物相似性上优于传统人工神经网络（ANN）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度人工神经网络（ANN）在模拟视觉皮层地形组织时忽略了时间动态，导致性能下降和生物相似性不足。为了解决这一问题，作者利用脉冲神经网络（SNN）的时间动态特性，提出了一种更接近生物真实性的模型。

Method: 作者设计了时空约束损失函数（STC），并将其应用于地形深度脉冲神经网络（TDSNN），以模拟视觉皮层从低级到高级的功能组织。

Result: 实验表明，TDSNN在ImageNet任务中性能几乎无下降（优于TopoNet的3%下降），同时在生物相似性和时间信息处理效率上表现更优。

Conclusion: TDSNN在计算性能和生物相似性之间取得了平衡，为神经科学现象的解释和高效深度学习模型的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: The primate visual cortex exhibits topographic organization, where
functionally similar neurons are spatially clustered, a structure widely
believed to enhance neural processing efficiency. While prior works have
demonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic
representations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This
oversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like
object recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this,
we leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture
spike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We
propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic
deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the
hierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual
cortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our
results show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features
across simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically
leads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture
exhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1
accuracy, compared to a 3\% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the
best-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in
brain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates
efficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in
TDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs
offer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like
features, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science
phenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep
learning models.

### [5] [Delving Deeper Into Astromorphic Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10925)
*Md Zesun Ahmed Mia,Malyaban Bal,Abhronil Sengupta*

Conclusion: Astromorphic Transformers在准确性和学习速度上优于传统模型，展示了跨任务泛化能力的提升。

Abstract: Preliminary attempts at incorporating the critical role of astrocytes - cells
that constitute more than 50\% of human brain cells - in brain-inspired
neuromorphic computing remain in infancy. This paper seeks to delve deeper into
various key aspects of neuron-synapse-astrocyte interactions to mimic
self-attention mechanisms in Transformers. The cross-layer perspective explored
in this work involves bioplausible modeling of Hebbian and presynaptic
plasticities in neuron-astrocyte networks, incorporating effects of
non-linearities and feedback along with algorithmic formulations to map the
neuron-astrocyte computations to self-attention mechanism and evaluating the
impact of incorporating bio-realistic effects from the machine learning
application side. Our analysis on sentiment and image classification tasks
(IMDB and CIFAR10 datasets) highlights the advantages of Astromorphic
Transformers, offering improved accuracy and learning speed. Furthermore, the
model demonstrates strong natural language generation capabilities on the
WikiText-2 dataset, achieving better perplexity compared to conventional
models, thus showcasing enhanced generalization and stability across diverse
machine learning tasks.

### [6] [Text2VR: Automated instruction Generation in Virtual Reality using Large language Models for Assembly Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03699)
*Subin Raj Peter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）自动从文本生成虚拟指令的新方法，以简化VR培训内容的开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR培训内容开发耗时且需要专业知识，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 结合LLM模块提取任务相关信息，智能模块将其转化为VR环境中的动画演示和视觉提示。

Result: 该方法提高了培训效果，减少了开发成本，使VR培训更具可扩展性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该研究为VR培训提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，有助于满足工业需求。

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,
offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill
acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,
developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to
the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging
instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two
core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the
text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated
demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module
receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.
Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant
data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by
changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate
tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development
overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving
industrial needs.

### [7] [Outlier Detection Algorithm for Circle Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03720)
*Ahmet Gökhan Poyraz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于极坐标的异常值检测算法（PCOD），用于提高圆拟合在噪声点集中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 噪声点集会影响圆拟合算法的效果，因此需要有效的异常值检测方法。

Method: 将点集转换为极坐标，计算局部和全局标准差，通过比较局部均值与全局标准差识别异常值。

Result: 在工业垫圈零件的高精度直径测量中，PCOD算法优于其他方法，提供了更高的准确性。

Conclusion: PCOD算法在工业环境中具有提升圆拟合应用性能的潜力。

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries,
particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The
effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the
point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection
and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.
This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)
algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In
the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar
coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard
deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with
the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement
of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed
through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting
sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and
removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is
made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier
detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy
within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle
fitting applications in industrial environments.

### [8] [Enhancing Diameter Measurement Accuracy in Machine Vision Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03721)
*Ahmet Gokhan Poyraz,Ahmet Emir Dirik,Hakan Gurkan,Mehmet Kacmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新方法（转换因子法和像素法）以提高相机测量系统的精度，显著减少误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相机测量系统在测量不同直径零件时存在误差，需改进精度。

Method: 使用已知参考零件，提出转换因子法和像素法两种方法。

Result: 实验显示误差从13-114微米降至1-2微米。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提高测量精度和可靠性，适用于多种零件测量。

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric
lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However,
despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to
mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are
particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are
measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to
enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion
factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the
conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter
(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly
estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The
experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.
Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show
that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were
reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few
known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement
of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method
enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing
error rates and improving measurement reliability.

Conclusion: MLLM的推理可靠性与轻量级融合网络的适应性可以协同作用，实现稳健且可扩展的情感识别。

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of trustworthy prior reasoning
knowledge from MLLMs into multimodal emotion recognition. We employ Gemini to
generate fine-grained, modality-separable reasoning traces, which are injected
as priors during the fusion stage to enrich cross-modal interactions. To
mitigate the pronounced class-imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, we
introduce Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning, a loss formulation that jointly
balances inter-class and intra-class distributions. Applied to the MER2024
benchmark, our prior-enhanced framework yields substantial performance gains,
demonstrating that the reliability of MLLM-derived reasoning can be
synergistically combined with the domain adaptability of lightweight fusion
networks for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to identify and segment sound-producing
objects in videos by leveraging both visual and audio modalities. It has
emerged as a significant research area in multimodal perception, enabling
fine-grained object-level understanding. In this survey, we present a
comprehensive overview of the AVS field, covering its problem formulation,
benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and the progression of methodologies.
We analyze a wide range of approaches, including architectures for unimodal and
multimodal encoding, key strategies for audio-visual fusion, and various
decoder designs. Furthermore, we examine major training paradigms, from fully
supervised learning to weakly supervised and training-free methods. Notably, we
provide an extensive comparison of AVS methods across standard benchmarks,
highlighting the impact of different architectural choices, fusion strategies,
and training paradigms on performance. Finally, we outline the current
challenges, such as limited temporal modeling, modality bias toward vision,
lack of robustness in complex environments, and high computational demands, and
propose promising future directions, including improving temporal reasoning and
multimodal fusion, leveraging foundation models for better generalization and
few-shot learning, reducing reliance on labeled data through selfand weakly
supervised learning, and incorporating higher-level reasoning for more
intelligent AVS systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出LLM4-IC8K框架，利用LLM解决IC机械图纸的几何标注问题，通过两阶段训练提升性能，并引入ICGeo8K数据集验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IC机械图纸的几何标注对PCB布局至关重要，但现有方法无法自动化处理，且当前LMMs在几何感知上表现不佳。

Method: 提出LLM4-IC8K框架，将IC图纸视为图像，分三步解决几何标注问题：感知引脚数量、计算引脚中心坐标、估计引脚尺寸。采用两阶段训练（合成数据预训练和真实数据微调）。

Result: 实验表明，LLM4-IC8K在ICGeo8K数据集上优于现有LMMs。

Conclusion: LLM4-IC8K为IC机械图纸的自动化几何标注提供了有效解决方案，并通过多模态数据集验证了其性能。

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated
circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between
components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception
proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract
diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling
remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist
for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.
In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our
findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric
perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry
labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel
framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for
structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning
approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:
perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,
and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage
framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint
diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on
real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical
scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with
8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and
4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的热红外图像去噪框架，结合潜在空间和小波域优化，显著提升了去噪效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热红外图像在机器人感知任务中潜力巨大，但受限于固定模式噪声，影响目标检测等任务。

Method: 利用预训练的稳定扩散模型，通过潜在空间和小波变换损失函数微调，并引入级联细化阶段增强细节。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，且对真实世界数据具有零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人部署提供了高效的热红外图像去噪解决方案。

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic
perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or
challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from
heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object
detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a
diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space
representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable
diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function
combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex
wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded
refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising
results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of
our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our
method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging
real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic
deployment.

### [13] [What is Beneath Misogyny: Misogynous Memes Classification and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03732)
*Kushal Kanwar,Dushyant Singh Chauhan,Gopendra Vikram Singh,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态方法MM-Misogyny，用于检测、分类和解释模因中的厌女内容，并通过新数据集WBMS验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模因在现代社会中广泛传播，但看似无害的模因可能传播有害意识形态（如厌女症），需要一种方法检测和理解其多模态特性。

Method: MM-Misogyny分别处理文本和图像模态，通过跨注意力机制统一为多模态上下文，再通过分类器和大型语言模型进行标注、分类和解释。

Result: 模型在WBMS数据集上表现优于现有方法，能够检测、分类并深入理解厌女症在不同生活领域中的表现。

Conclusion: MM-Misogyny为检测和解释厌女模因提供了有效工具，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Memes are popular in the modern world and are distributed primarily for
entertainment. However, harmful ideologies such as misogyny can be propagated
through innocent-looking memes. The detection and understanding of why a meme
is misogynous is a research challenge due to its multimodal nature (image and
text) and its nuanced manifestations across different societal contexts. We
introduce a novel multimodal approach, \textit{namely},
\textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic
content in memes. \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} processes text and image
modalities separately and unifies them into a multimodal context through a
cross-attention mechanism. The resulting multimodal context is then easily
processed for labeling, categorization, and explanation via a classifier and
Large Language Model (LLM). The evaluation of the proposed model is performed
on a newly curated dataset (\textit{\textbf{W}hat's \textbf{B}eneath
\textbf{M}isogynous \textbf{S}tereotyping (WBMS)}) created by collecting
misogynous memes from cyberspace and categorizing them into four categories,
\textit{namely}, Kitchen, Leadership, Working, and Shopping. The model not only
detects and classifies misogyny, but also provides a granular understanding of
how misogyny operates in domains of life. The results demonstrate the
superiority of our approach compared to existing methods. The code and dataset
are available at

Conclusion: 该方法在无需训练的情况下，高效解决了主题一致性问题，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using
text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of
maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches,
which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally
expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing
capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an
efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly
with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention
sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and
Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved
subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of
scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart
city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations
and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques,
such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer
from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source
mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence
applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth.
However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments
introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks
trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach
that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by
combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data
collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our
approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process
both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing
spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For
the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei.
We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss
information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to
three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard
index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff
distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of
65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields
40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and
(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

Conclusion: VQ-DeepISC为数字语义通信提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic
and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical
applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems
from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog
representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring
robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized
(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image
transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding
(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic
feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete
latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission
instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we
develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically
optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during
training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a
uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to
stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook
updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase
shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental
results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system
over benchmark methods.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a
wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep
learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a
lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects
in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of
AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep
learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features,
in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we
present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved
by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of
geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection
pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance.
Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that
previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both
natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets.
This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

Motivation: 准确估计地铁站台拥挤程度可提升运营决策能力，改善安全、效率和乘客体验，但现有方法依赖间接数据，实时性不足。

Method: 比较了三种计算机视觉方法：目标检测与计数（YOLOv11、RT-DETRv2、APGCC）、人群分类（Crowd-ViT）和语义分割（DeepLabV3），并提出一种基于线性优化的计数方法。

Result: 在包含600多小时视频的隐私保护数据集上测试，证明计算机视觉方法能有效估计拥挤程度。

Conclusion: CCTV数据可独立实现精确的实时拥挤估计，支持及时运营响应。

Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit
agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving
safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the
context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging
and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or
staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has
emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,
real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential
by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting
crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and
counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification
via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic
segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly
efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the
generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,
for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving
dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our
results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive
value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,
independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable
more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational
responses for platform crowding mitigation.

Conclusion: 该框架为农业深度学习应用提供了显著进步。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate weed
segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. A quality-aware modular
deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by
analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through
specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each
degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur
using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically
routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images,
a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or
another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel
routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in
both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a
significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing
is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the
acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and
the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel
pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their
corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a
source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually
realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM).
Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the
image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact
layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a
visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data
file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable
and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the
creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate
document intelligence models.

TL;DR: Refine-IQA框架通过多阶段强化微调（RFT）提升图像质量评估（IQA）模型的感知和评分能力，并引入对“思考”过程的监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RFT-based IQA方法缺乏对“思考”过程的奖励监督，且未明确增强模型的低层次视觉质量感知能力。

Method: 提出Refine-IQA框架，包括两阶段：1）构建Refine-Perception-20K数据集并设计多任务奖励函数；2）引入概率差异奖励策略监督“思考”过程。

Result: Refine-IQA系列模型在感知和评分任务上表现优异，并激活了强大的“思考”能力。

Conclusion: Refine-IQA框架通过多阶段RFT显著提升了IQA模型的性能，并验证了其对“思考”过程监督的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training.
Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to
low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing
RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the
model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process,
leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods
typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly
enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may
constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose
the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the
Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907
locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task
reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In
Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability
difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The
resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both
perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust
"think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results
on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Motivation: 高吞吐量4D-STEM数据采集中的噪声、中心漂移和椭圆畸变导致定量测量偏差，传统校正算法缺乏通用性。

Method: 结合注意力增强的U-Net和ResNet架构，通过大规模模拟数据集训练，实现去噪、中心校正和椭圆畸变校准。

Result: 去噪均方误差降低50%，中心定位误差低于0.04像素，优于传统算法。

Conclusion: 4D-PreNet为自动化4D-STEM实时分析提供了可靠的高通量解决方案。

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with
high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical
bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift,
and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably
corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements.
Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to
provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet,
an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net
and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center
correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on
large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift
magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to
experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during
denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection
task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked
against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise
suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating
high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated
characterization.

address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1)
We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating
1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from
state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images.
(2) We introduce a VLM-based preference model trained using an
uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose
Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that
enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at
each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust
metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and
human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality. The code and
dataset are available at the HPSv3 Homepage.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on
planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science
research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide
critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and
impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning
models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this
paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater
detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a
framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features
crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the
second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater
localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and
present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We
consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon
based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the
most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in
identifying large craters with high precision.

Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape
representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have
considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods
do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead.
Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating
shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to
formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based
shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in
the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived
from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our
correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal
shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.
We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream
tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting
morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection
of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at
different locations from different images independently as well as
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine
learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions
along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation
performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists
tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the
specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained
segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable
combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the
policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next
step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best
localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled
multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its
potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,
especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show
that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more
interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal
strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist
guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising
interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human
radiologists.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的手动标注视频，难以扩展到开放世界的多样化音频-视频类别。

Method: 两阶段训练：第一阶段自动筛选大规模噪声视频进行预训练；第二阶段在小规模高质量数据上微调。采用多特征条件和窗口注意力增强同步性。

Result: 方法显著减少手动标注需求（10倍以上），并在48类视频基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法高效扩展了音频同步视觉动画的应用范围，减少了对高质量标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of
video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods
rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific
training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes
in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training
paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but
noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for
pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video
alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated
high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the
required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each
frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window
attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video
generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable
parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the
generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark
with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous
benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces
reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open
classes.

Conclusion: RAVID通过视觉检索增强生成显著提升了AI生成图像检测的性能和鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image
detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG
methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation
models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge
underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with
generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and
model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID
dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach
utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with
category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further
integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the
query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID
generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images
from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched
input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the
UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that
RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.
RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining
high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under
degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model
C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task
with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is
challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the
variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in
inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,
reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art
methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance
of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We
fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large
public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against
baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world
food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals
that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained
on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO
dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific
regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides
quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset
characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for
effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JanusNet是一种用于3D医学图像分割的数据增强框架，通过全局建模解剖连续性和局部关注难分割区域，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据增强方法破坏3D医学图像解剖连续性和难以处理小器官等挑战区域的问题。

Method: 提出双阶段框架：Slice-Block Shuffle保持解剖连续性，Confidence-Guided Displacement增强难分割区域信号。

Result: 在Synapse和AMOS数据集上表现优异，例如仅用20%标注数据即在Synapse上提升4% DSC。

Conclusion: JanusNet通过结合解剖连续性和难区域增强，显著提升了弱监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly
supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to
increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has
demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent
anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to
severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging
regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize
human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation
framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while
locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block
Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across
volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes
perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided
Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each
slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned
framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most
teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets
demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20%
labeled data.

Conclusion: CAD-Judge通过可验证奖励和编译器模块，有效解决了Text-to-CAD系统的关键问题，提升了生成模型的实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design,
simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate
editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly
reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD
workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to
review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that
degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a
novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference
grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module
(CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing
generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness
of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective
agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module
(CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system
to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining superior efficiency.

Motivation: 视频扩散模型因联合建模时空信息导致长令牌序列，带来高校准方差和学习挑战，量化虽能减少计算成本但面临性能敏感性问题。

Result: 在W4A6量化下实现无损性能，模型压缩3.9倍，推理加速1.3倍。

Conclusion: S²Q-VDiT有效解决了V-DMs量化中的性能敏感性和学习挑战，为视频生成模型提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video
generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs
significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion
models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high
calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for
V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token
distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate
this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which
constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and
quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning
challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.
Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token
Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize
tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6
quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering
$3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）虽在多模态任务中表现优异，但缺乏对错误输入的主动检测能力，这一问题尚未被充分研究。

Method: 提出ISEval框架，包含七类错误前提和三项评估指标，对十种先进LMMs进行广泛评估。

Result: 多数模型在无指导时难以主动检测错误，对逻辑错误表现较好，但对语言错误和条件性错误表现较差；不同模型对模态信息的信任度不同。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升LMMs主动验证输入有效性的紧迫性，并提供了缓解该问题的新见解。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing
formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional
performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language
models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile
reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether
LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability
Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed
premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced
LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect
flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on
explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects
performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with
surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust
varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info,
while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore
the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and
shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在遥感图像语义分割中难以统一类表示和区分相似特征，导致结果不完整。

Method: 设计了三个模块：APEM提取无偏类原型，SSCM协调语义与结构信息，CSAM动态调整类间特征。

Result: PDSSNet在实验中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PDSSNet通过语义与结构的协同，显著提升了分割结果的完整性。

Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete
ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

Result: 在构建的FDRD数据集上，DCAR取得了优于现有基线的性能。

Conclusion: DCAR通过双提示学习和联合优化策略，显著提升了图像-文本检索任务的性能。

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as
image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text
Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in
discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the
downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning
with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning
framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically
adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the
performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,
DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained
representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it
dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image
mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces
negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to
learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the
Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging
benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream
fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute
annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

Motivation: 城市环境中路边停车导致的NLoS盲区对道路安全构成威胁，尤其是行人突然出现时。现有方法依赖预定义空间信息或简单反射假设，通用性和实用性有限。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实城市道路环境中能更早检测行人，提升道路安全。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了动态停车车辆导致的NLoS行人定位问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent
studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.
However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial
information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their
generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in
scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as
these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information
obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately
reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization
framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud
(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image
segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and
subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise
spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road
environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian
detection and contributes to improved road safety. Supplementary materials are

Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with
further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed
to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different

of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient

representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有暗图像恢复方法存在效率瓶颈，包括依赖外部先验的计算负担、多阶段增强管道的冗余操作以及频率域方法中全局计算的过度需求。

Method: 提出SPJFNet，包括自挖掘引导模块（SMGM）生成轻量级内生先验，通过无损小波分解和联合傅里叶增强优化频率处理，并设计双频引导框架（DFGF）分离高低频处理。

Result: SPJFNet在多个基准测试中表现优异，不仅性能超越现有技术，还显著降低了模型复杂度和计算开销。

Conclusion: SPJFNet通过内生先验和高效频率处理，显著提升了暗图像恢复的效率和性能。

Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency
bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error
correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or
cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement
pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in
frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided
Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce
a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous
guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors
and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference
speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain
characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into
a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint
Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing
parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance
Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency
branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain
low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially
reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks
demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but
also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model
complexity and computational overhead. Code is available at

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型在时间建模和因果推理方面的弱点，为未来开发更强大的VTR系统指明了方向。

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that
empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal
relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and
laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and
incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world
human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically
diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential
reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6
well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality
question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended
counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction
pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task
selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large
multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification
ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations
of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in
static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,
multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state
recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight
fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing
clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and
generalizable VTR systems. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in
medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success.
However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting
the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small
volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation
strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data,
have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative
pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor
segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based
adaptive augmentation mechanism, aiming to inject tumor uncertainties present
in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally,
IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more
robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive
experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.
Ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical
contributions.

Conclusion: 该方法为手语视频生成提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions
with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two
critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor
generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation
that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase
synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion
lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D
mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact
representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous
motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into
temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural
rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior
work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a
first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable
"choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human
appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from
identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality
synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

TL;DR: 提出了DOMR框架，通过密集对象匹配和细化实现跨视角对象对应，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨视角（第一人称和第三人称）对象对应是视觉理解中的关键但具有挑战性的任务。

Method: DOMR框架包含Dense Object Matcher（DOM）模块，联合建模多个对象的位置和语义关系，并结合掩码细化头提升精度。

Result: 在Ego-Exo4D基准测试中，DOMR的mIoU达到49.7%（Ego→Exo）和55.2%（Exo→Ego），分别优于之前方法5.8%和4.3%。

Conclusion: DOMR框架通过集成对象关系和掩码细化，显著提升了跨视角对象对应的性能。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric
(first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet
challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense
Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object
correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object
Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods
that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages
both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find
correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense
matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,
explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching
among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed
to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the
complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform
those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the
effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于全局可预测插值（GPI）的白盒Transformer框架（GPI-WT），用于k空间数据插值，显著提高了精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如基于卷积神经网络的深度学习）主要利用局部可预测性，忽略了k空间的全局依赖性。Transformer因其捕捉长距离依赖的能力而受到启发，但其缺乏可解释性。

Method: 从湮灭角度提出GPI作为新的k空间结构化低秩（SLR）模型，将全局湮灭滤波器作为可学习参数，并通过展开SLR的子梯度优化算法构建白盒Transformer。

Result: 实验表明，GPI-WT在k空间插值精度上显著优于现有方法，同时提供更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: GPI-WT结合了Transformer的全局依赖捕捉能力和SLR模型的可解释性，为加速MRI提供了高效且可靠的工具。

Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.
However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep
learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent
global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to
their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of
Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.
However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the
reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose
GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable
Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the
perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.
The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable
parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable
attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm
of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer
specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

TL;DR: Uni-DocDiff是一个基于扩散模型的统一文档修复模型，通过可学习的任务提示和创新的Prior Pool机制，实现了多任务的高效协同与扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常独立处理文档修复任务，导致系统复杂且难以扩展。Uni-DocDiff旨在通过统一模型解决这些问题，并充分利用任务间的协同效应。

Method: 提出可学习的任务提示设计，确保模型扩展性；引入Prior Pool机制结合局部和全局特征；设计Prior Fusion Module（PFM）自适应选择任务相关特征。

Result: 实验表明，Uni-DocDiff在性能上媲美甚至超越专用模型，同时具备对新任务的无缝适应能力。

Conclusion: Uni-DocDiff为文档修复提供了一种高效、可扩展的统一解决方案，显著提升了多任务协同能力。

Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits
digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods
often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading
to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent
studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited
scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to
fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly
scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a
learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse
tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential
task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet
comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and
global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior
\textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively
select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive
experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable
or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and
simultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在医学图像分割中表现出色，但存在计算复杂度高和局部特征捕获不足的问题。

Method: TCSAFormer引入压缩注意力模块（CA）减少计算复杂度，并采用双分支前馈网络（DBFFN）增强局部特征捕获。

Result: 在ISIC-2018、CVC-ClinicDB和Synapse数据集上，TCSAFormer性能优于现有方法，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: TCSAFormer在效率和准确性之间取得了最佳平衡，适用于医学图像分割。

Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress
in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了O-Bench，首个针对遮挡感知的VQA基准，评估了22种MLLM与人类表现的差距，并发现模型扩展或思维过程无法完全弥补这一差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遮挡感知是空间理解的关键，但现有MLLM在此领域表现未充分探索，需专门评估工具。

Method: 基于SA-1B构建1,365张语义连贯的遮挡图像，标注4,588个问答对，评估22种MLLM。

Result: 发现MLLM与人类表现存在显著差距，模型扩展或思维过程无法完全弥补，并识别出三种典型失败模式。

Conclusion: O-Bench为遮挡感知提供了重要评估工具，并启发MLLM视觉智能的发展。

Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial
understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and
reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains
under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion
perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically
coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon
this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five
tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive
evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a
significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,
cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further
identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,
a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We
believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion
perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual
intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper
publication.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TNet的简单高效架构，通过卷积和加法操作逐步融合多分辨率特征，解决了现有分割网络忽视全局上下文依赖的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割网络（如UNet）通常关注局部特征交互，而忽略了多分辨率间的全局上下文依赖。

Method: 提出TNet架构，利用卷积和加法操作逐步将低分辨率特征（全局上下文）融入高分辨率特征（局部细节）。

Result: 在ISPRS Vaihingen、ISPRS Potsdam和LoveDA数据集上分别达到85.35%、87.05%和52.19%的mIoU，计算效率高。

Conclusion: TNet通过简单操作有效融合全局与局部信息，性能优越且高效。

Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture,
often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance
global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these
enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the
global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a
simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition
operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global
context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across
decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn
spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local
information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder
(TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves
competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\%
on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while
maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.

TL;DR: 3DSR是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的超分辨率框架，利用现成的2D扩散超分辨率模型，确保3D一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如图像上采样或视频超分辨率）未明确考虑3D一致性或仅隐式处理，3DSR旨在通过显式3D表示解决这一问题。

Method: 使用3D高斯泼溅场景表示结合2D扩散超分辨率模型，无需额外微调即可提升视觉质量。

Result: 在MipNeRF360和LLFF数据上验证，3DSR生成高分辨率且视觉吸引的结果，同时保持3D重建的结构一致性。

Conclusion: 3DSR通过显式3D表示和2D模型结合，实现了高质量且一致的3D超分辨率。

Abstract: We propose 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a novel 3D Gaussian-splatting-based
super-resolution framework that leverages off-the-shelf diffusion-based 2D
super-resolution models. 3DSR encourages 3D consistency across views via the
use of an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. This makes
the proposed 3DSR different from prior work, such as image upsampling or the
use of video super-resolution, which either don't consider 3D consistency or
aim to incorporate 3D consistency implicitly. Notably, our method enhances
visual quality without additional fine-tuning, ensuring spatial coherence
within the reconstructed scene. We evaluate 3DSR on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data,
demonstrating that it produces high-resolution results that are visually
compelling, while maintaining structural consistency in 3D reconstructions.
Code will be released.

Motivation: 在稀疏视图条件下实现准确的几何重建是一个关键挑战，现有方法在捕捉细粒度结构和处理深度估计噪声方面表现不佳。

Method: DET-GS引入了分层几何深度监督框架和边缘感知深度正则化，结合RGB引导的边缘保留总变差损失。

Result: 实验表明，DET-GS在几何精度和视觉保真度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DET-GS通过统一的正则化框架，显著提升了稀疏视图条件下的重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the
field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent
progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view
conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on
non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures
and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional
smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade
essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of
reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware
regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a
hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces
multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity
and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we
design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from
Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving
Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while
rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric
accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on
sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决MLLMs在像素级密集预测上的不足，避免现有方法中SAM的高参数或轻量级方法的低精度问题。

Method: 提出MLLMSeg框架，利用MLLM视觉编码器的细节特征，设计DSFF模块融合视觉与语义特征，并使用轻量级掩码解码器（34M参数）。

Result: 在实验中表现优于SAM-based和SAM-free方法，平衡性能与成本。

Conclusion: MLLMSeg通过高效特征融合和轻量设计，为RES任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions
specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of
multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding,
their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction.
Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment
Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight
pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance
and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully
exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder
without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a
detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully
integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature
output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a
light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally
leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic
features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free
competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost. Code is

Motivation: 医学图像分析需要大量标注数据，但现有VLM模型因领域差异难以直接应用。现有方法通常只关注单模态知识引入，导致模态不对齐。

Method: 提出NEARL-CLIP框架，包含USEformer（动态生成跨模态查询）和OCA（正交技术分离新知识）。

Result: NEARL-CLIP以仅1.46M可学习参数实现了模态交互和知识增强。

Conclusion: NEARL-CLIP通过跨模态交互和正交技术，显著提升了医学图像分析的性能。

Abstract: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific
model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong
generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging
analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge
this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction
techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single
modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality
misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\underline{N}teracted qu\underline{E}ry
\underline{A}daptation with o\underline{R}thogona\underline{L} Regularization),
a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two
contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which
dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between
modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal
medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA
introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from
USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the
incremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference
of incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new
information, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing
the capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in
a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \textbf{1.46M} learnable
parameters.

Conclusion: DS²Net通过多视角深度监督和不确定性损失，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical
imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the
coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in
isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold
vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of
complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing
a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates
both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through
Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM
respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and
semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from
single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also
equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively
assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on
their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that
typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks
captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate
that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical
image analysis.

Abstract: Human perception studies can provide complementary insights to qualitative
evaluation for understanding computer vision (CV) model performance. However,
conducting human perception studies remains a non-trivial task, it often
requires complex, end-to-end system setups that are time-consuming and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we explore the unique opportunity presented
by augmented reality (AR) for helping CV researchers to conduct perceptual
studies. We design ARCADE, an evaluation platform that allows researchers to
easily leverage AR's rich context and interactivity for human-centered CV
evaluation. Specifically, ARCADE supports cross-platform AR data collection,
custom experiment protocols via pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for
user studies. We demonstrate ARCADE using two types of CV models, depth and
lighting estimation and show that AR tasks can be effectively used to elicit
human perceptual judgments of model quality. We also evaluate the systems
usability and performance across different deployment and study settings,
highlighting its flexibility and effectiveness as a human-centered evaluation
platform.

Conclusion: UniFGVC具有广泛的兼容性和泛化能力，适用于多样的小样本细粒度视觉分类场景。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited
data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works
mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance
gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with
this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that
reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the
Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the
open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a
structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features
distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought
prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and
enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each
image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature
representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot
samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and
text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by
retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad
compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization
and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12
FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot
CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

Method: GAT模型包含上下文聚合的实例收集模块和实例轨迹追踪模块，分别用于整合文本表示和建立时空关系。

Result: GAT在多个数据集上表现优异，准确率提升3.86%，推理速度比视频大语言模型快十倍。

Conclusion: GAT通过实例导向的方法显著提升了视频文本视觉问答的性能和效率。

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer
questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a
video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers
from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in
limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel
model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result
for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is
designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and
textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.
Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an
instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish
spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.
Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the
effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing
Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large
language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses
the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and
achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有车辆搜索方法需先检测再重识别，资源消耗大且不实用，因此需要一种端到端的联合解决方案。

Method: 提出CLIPVehicle框架，包含双粒度语义区域对齐模块和多层次车辆识别学习策略，利用视觉语言模型进行车辆区分建模。

Result: 在构建的真实和合成数据集上，CLIPVehicle在车辆重识别和人员搜索任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CLIPVehicle通过联合建模检测与重识别，显著提升了车辆搜索的效率和性能。

Abstract: Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real
world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made
remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc.
To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods
first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle
re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical.
In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for
vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that
focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on
individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an
end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely
CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module
to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination
modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn
the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also
construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two
synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

TL;DR: ViFP是一个提升视觉语言模型推理可靠性的框架，通过检测错误推理路径（FP）来提高答案准确性和推理合理性，减少数据集依赖和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在视觉语言模型推理中因错误推理路径（FP）导致的高训练成本和泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: 构建基于视觉推理核心维度的子问题模板，通过多轮QA构建有效推理路径，动态分析推理一致性并引入自适应CoT机制。

Result: 在A-OKVQA、OKVQA和FVQA数据集上表现优异，A-OKVQA准确率提升5.4%，FP数量显著减少。

Conclusion: ViFP显著提升视觉语言模型的推理可靠性，同时保持高准确性，为评估模型可靠性提供了新工具VoC。

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs
when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning
path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and
reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited
generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for
enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and
reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset
dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates
grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object
localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then
builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning
accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning
path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought
(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby
reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.
Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates
answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess
whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our
experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves
performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP
improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by
4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in
enhancing reasoning reliability.

Result: 在多个真实世界基准测试中实现最佳性能，无需目标数据重新训练。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在实例分割任务中具有潜力，OC-DiT展示了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for
object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation.
We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance
masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image
features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to
effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which
is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically,
we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object
instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in
parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic
dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world
benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion
models for instance segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: LayerT2V是一种分层生成视频的方法，解决了多物体运动轨迹控制的挑战，显著提升了生成质量和控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频（T2V）生成方法在多物体运动场景中表现不佳，尤其是轨迹交叉时语义冲突严重。

Method: 通过分层合成背景和前景物体，将每个物体置于独立层上，实现灵活的多物体合成。

Result: 实验显示，LayerT2V在mIoU和AP50指标上分别比现有方法提升了1.4倍和4.5倍。

Conclusion: LayerT2V为复杂多物体视频生成提供了高效解决方案，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a
challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the
T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of
current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion
control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or
experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect,
primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these
limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by
compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered
generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within
a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating
coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in
generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x
improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Motivation: 当前水下图像增强技术多依赖多尺度特征融合，但实验表明单尺度特征提取也能达到甚至超越多尺度方法的性能，且复杂度更低。

Method: 提出SSD-Net，采用不对称分解机制分离图像为清洁层和退化层，结合CNN的局部特征提取和Transformer的全局建模能力，通过PFDB和BFCB模块实现特征解耦和交互。

Result: SSD-Net在性能上匹配或超越多尺度方法，同时显著降低了复杂度。

Conclusion: 单尺度特征提取在水下图像增强中具有潜力，SSD-Net通过创新设计实现了高效的特征解耦和增强。

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality
of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues
caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,
blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ
multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction
quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not
necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our
experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or
surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing
complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in
underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition
Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition
mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation
layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes
medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature
extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through
two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing
dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and
adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block
(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature
mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition
independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways,
effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception,
particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands
on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially
Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired
new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be
directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its
text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the
mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its
utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core
components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a
context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models
the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a
structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.
Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying
and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing
rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a
new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named
VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations
across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative
baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. %
Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球垃圾污染日益严重，开发自动化工具高效检测垃圾是一个重要挑战。

Method: 首次将特权信息与深度学习目标检测结合，通过编码边界框信息为二进制掩码优化检测。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了方法的有效性，检测准确性和泛化能力均有提升，且未增加模型复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方法为垃圾检测提供了实用解决方案，平衡了准确性和效率。

Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools
capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This
study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged
information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection
while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely
used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small
litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this,
a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of
encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the
detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both
within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset
evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate
consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only
bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well
to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved
without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring
computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this
methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing
accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

TL;DR: ProtoN是一种基于图的少样本学习框架，用于耳部生物识别，通过联合处理多个印象并利用原型图神经网络（PGNN）提升识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耳部生物识别因标注数据稀缺和类内变异性大而受限，现有方法难以提取一致且具有区分性的特征。

Method: 提出ProtoN框架，将每个印象表示为类特定图中的节点，并引入可学习的原型节点。通过PGNN层和跨图原型对齐策略优化特征表示。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，ProtoN达到最高99.60%的Rank-1识别准确率和0.025的EER。

Conclusion: ProtoN在少样本耳部识别中表现出色，有效解决了数据稀缺和类内变异问题。

Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity
recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods
typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation,
restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative
representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework,
ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity
using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a
class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes
identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural
Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and
prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To
further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph
prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing
intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction.
Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global
classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the
embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets
demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1
identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as
0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited
data conditions.

Result: 21支团队提交最终结果，挑战赛促进模型适应性和可解释性。

Conclusion: SVC 2025挑战赛为多模态欺骗检测提供了新基准，推动实际应用发展。

Abstract: Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as
security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep
learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance,
their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and
diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on
single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation
caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025
Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate
cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants
are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual
domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By
leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge
encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit
deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of
more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection
systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion
of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final
results. https://sites.google.com/view/svc-mm25 for more information.

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase
renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of
Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and
accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper
presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that
generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both
computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on
segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the
orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing
perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View)
and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish
residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall
ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation
analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and
has broader applications in urban development and planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在消除有害概念时存在不完全消除和生成质量下降的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: ErasePro通过引入零残差约束和渐进式分层更新策略，确保目标概念与锚概念完美对齐，并减少对深层参数的修改。

Result: 实验证明ErasePro在不同概念消除任务中表现优异，实现了更彻底的消除和更好的生成质量。

Conclusion: ErasePro是一种高效且有效的方法，解决了现有概念消除技术的局限性。

Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from
generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target
concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate
this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with
semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update
the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue
that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in
incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text
prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality
degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.
To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is
designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall
generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict
zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect
alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete
erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that
gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from
shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes
diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving
generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks
(including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our ErasePro.

Result: 实验表明，IDC-Net在视觉质量和几何一致性上优于现有方法，且生成的RGB-D序列可直接用于3D场景重建。

Conclusion: IDC-Net通过联合学习框架实现了高质量的RGB-D序列生成，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present IDC-Net (Image-Depth Consistency Network), a novel framework
designed to generate RGB-D video sequences under explicit camera trajectory
control. Unlike approaches that treat RGB and depth generation separately,
IDC-Net jointly synthesizes both RGB images and corresponding depth maps within
a unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework
strengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more
precise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of
this camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct
a camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth
maps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision
with notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce
a geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control,
enhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that
IDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual
quality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the
generated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene
reconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the
practical benefits of our joint learning framework. See more at

Motivation: 当前因果表示学习主要关注场景变量的识别与表示，而对干预本身的表示研究较少。本文旨在通过干预的表示提升模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出因果增量嵌入（Causal Delta Embedding）方法，该嵌入对视觉场景不变且对因果变量的影响稀疏，并通过无监督框架从图像对中学习。

Result: 在Causal Triplet挑战中，因果增量嵌入在合成和真实世界基准测试中显著优于基线性能。

Conclusion: 因果增量嵌入是一种有效的干预表示方法，能显著提升模型在OOD场景中的表现。

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest
during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and
robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the
property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the
intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state.
While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the
variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on
representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an
effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to
focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,
we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding
that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal
variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is
capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any
additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate
that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,
significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有LoRA融合方法在多任务适应中易引发权重冲突和领域遗忘，ICM-Fusion旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出ICM-Fusion框架，结合元学习和上下文适应，通过任务向量算术和Fusion VAE实现多任务LoRA生成。

Result: 实验表明ICM-Fusion能显著减少多任务损失，并在少样本场景中实现任务增强。

Conclusion: ICM-Fusion是一种高效的多任务LoRA融合方法，适用于多种架构和任务。

Abstract: Enabling multi-task adaptation in pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
models is crucial for enhancing their generalization capabilities. Most
existing pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing
similar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm
inevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain
forgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it
struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when
the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting
in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA
Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with
in-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,
which dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains
through learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task
vector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the
orientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed
by a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We
have conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the
experimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range
of architectural models and applied to various tasks. Compared to the current
pre-trained LoRA fusion method, ICM-Fusion fused LoRA can significantly reduce
the multi-tasking loss and can even achieve task enhancement in few-shot
scenarios.

Result: 实验表明RAIDX在多个基准测试中表现优异，实现了最先进的检测性能，并提供了可解释的文本描述和显著性图。

Conclusion: RAIDX是首个统一RAG和GRPO的框架，填补了深度伪造检测在准确性和可解释性上的关键空白。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of
hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation.
Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or
general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a
classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based
approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and
dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX
(Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel
deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and
decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate
external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to
autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps,
eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and
providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency
maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing
transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified
framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and
explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

### [72] [Audio-Assisted Face Video Restoration with Temporal and Identity Complementary Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04161)
*Yuqin Cao,Yixuan Gao,Wei Sun,Xiaohong Liu,Yulun Zhang,Xiongkuo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用音频辅助人脸视频修复网络（GAVN），通过身份和时间互补学习解决多种视频失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了视觉和音频特征的内在关联，尤其是嘴部区域，且仅关注压缩伪影去除。

Method: GAVN先在低分辨率空间捕获帧间时间特征进行粗修复，再在高分辨率空间结合音频信号和面部标志提取帧内身份特征以恢复细节，最后整合特征生成高质量视频。

Result: 实验表明GAVN在压缩伪影去除、去模糊和超分辨率任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GAVN通过结合音频和视觉特征，实现了更全面的视频修复效果。

Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives,
while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration
methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio
features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration
methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact
removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video
restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video
distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically,
GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space
to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts
intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance
of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally,
the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to
generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression
artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon
publication.

Conclusion: 该方法为海洋视频理解与分析提供了有效工具，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to
the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion,
and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets,
typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize
to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine
life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine
object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video
understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and
segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to
improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation.
Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to
detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich
the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at

Motivation: 社交媒体模因常传播有害内容，但数据获取和标注成本高，阻碍了内容审核系统的发展。

Method: 构建两阶段标注数据集（毒性和细粒度分类），并设计标签生成模块增强上下文。

Result: 实验表明，加入标签显著提升了检测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态在线环境的内容审核提供了新颖且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and
societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media
playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used
mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful
content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of
dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To
address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset
of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary
classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic
memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is
that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,
enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation
module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes
often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these
tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection
tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved
content moderation in multimodal online environments.

Result: 在UnAV-100和ActivityNet1.3数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在弱监督下显著提升了跨模态事件定位的准确性。

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally
localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio
and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more
challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level
event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are
unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors},
which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak
supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and
visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement
Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the
discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the
agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor
Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features
through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The
anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an
\textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic
encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating
better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks
for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有基于GRPO的方法在训练数据利用和推理过程监督方面存在不足，限制了MLLMs在专业异常检测中的应用。

Method: 提出多阶段审议推理过程和细粒度奖励机制，优化GRPO训练并增强推理监督。

Result: 在多个工业数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了模型在专业异常检测中的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功弥合了通用MLLMs能力与专业异常检测需求之间的差距，实现了高效适应和准确检测。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly
detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two
critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce
uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that
encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose
a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic
innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process
that guides models from region identification to focused examination,
generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while
enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a
fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and
localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals
that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates
substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models
to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with
efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap
between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual
discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and
structural irregularities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型（如SAM）在多掩码预测和类别特定分割任务中的局限性，以及无法统一所有分割任务的缺陷。

Method: 提出统一框架和VGD分割任务，支持多数据集联合训练。

Result: X-SAM在多个图像分割基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: X-SAM为多模态像素级视觉理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad
knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level
perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents
a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it
exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific
segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a
unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a
streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the
segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any
segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that
enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.
Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)
segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual
prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative
capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present
a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its
efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding. Code is available

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注架构创新，忽视了极端暗光条件下特征表示的不确定性和噪声主导问题。

Method: 提出U2CLLIE框架，包含不确定性感知双域去噪模块（UaD）和分层因果感知框架（LEN、NeCo、AsC）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能，表现出鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: U2CLLIE有效解决了低光图像增强中的不确定性和因果建模问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on
architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty
within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions
where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability
and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel
framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color
causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty,
our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware
Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive
Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise
and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial
texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement,
effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A
hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network
(LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then,
during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling
modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color
Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints.
These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color
consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark
datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across
various scenes.

Abstract: There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models
similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous
analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains
incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in

Motivation: 解决大规模文本到图像扩散模型在资源受限设备上推理时的参数规模问题。

Method: 结合分层位置剪枝、位置权重保护和敏感度引导蒸馏三种技术。

Result: 内存占用减少77.5-80.4%，延迟降低27.9-38.0%，输出质量接近原始模型。

Conclusion: HierarchicalPrune在保持感知质量的同时，显著优于现有方法，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable
quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges
for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:
DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish
semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.
HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks
based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which
systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic
structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts
knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity
variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models
into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the
quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight
quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction
(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on
server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score
and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our
comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that
HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model
while significantly outperforming prior works.

Motivation: 传统RPCA模型存在计算负担大、依赖精细调参和动态场景适应性差的问题，需要一种更高效且灵活的方法。

Method: RPCANet++将松弛的RPCA模型展开为结构化网络，包含背景近似模块（BAM）、目标提取模块（OEM）和图像恢复模块（IRM），并引入记忆增强模块（MAM）和深度对比先验模块（DCPM）优化性能。

Result: 在多种数据集上的实验表明，RPCANet++在各种成像场景下实现了最先进的性能，并通过可视化和数值测量提升了可解释性。

Conclusion: RPCANet++结合RPCA的理论优势与深度网络的高效性，为可靠且可解释的稀疏目标分割设定了新基准。

Abstract: Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix
into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has
enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to
segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational
burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters,
and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these
limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that
fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our
approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a
Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and
an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in
the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background
feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages
saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under
various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and
numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical
strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new
baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation. Codes are

Result: 评估五种遗忘方法，发现它们在生物医学MLLMs中移除有害知识的效果有限。

Conclusion: 该工作为生物医学MLLMs的安全研究提供了新方向，显示现有方法仍需改进。

Abstract: The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain
private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,
potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.
An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content
and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant
computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning
has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by
selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while
preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no
available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection
in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark
Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built
upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic
private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets
two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is
mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally
respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where
wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,
leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning
Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance
across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med
and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful
knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.
This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising
field.

Conclusion: BootSC通过端到端联合优化和新技术显著提升了谱聚类的性能。

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major
shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited
representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral
clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral
clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means
clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages
effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the
affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a
semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced
to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the
discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves
state-of-the-art clustering performance. For example, it accomplishes a notable
16\% NMI improvement over the runner-up method on the challenging ImageNet-Dogs
dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/spdj2271/BootSC.

Abstract: The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis
of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown
great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the
differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health
record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address
these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion
Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined
with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract
lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal
data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module,
which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature
fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results
showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current

Conclusion: 研究为未来开放词汇模型的改进提供了重要见解和方向。

Abstract: Standard segmentation setups are unable to deliver models that can recognize
concepts outside the training taxonomy. Open-vocabulary approaches promise to
close this gap through language-image pretraining on billions of image-caption
pairs. Unfortunately, we observe that the promise is not delivered due to
several bottlenecks that have caused the performance to plateau for almost two
years. This paper proposes novel oracle components that identify and decouple
these bottlenecks by taking advantage of the groundtruth information. The
presented validation experiments deliver important empirical findings that
provide a deeper insight into the failures of open-vocabulary models and
suggest prominent approaches to unlock the future research.

TL;DR: SplitGaussian提出了一种新框架，通过将场景表示分解为静态和动态组件，解决了动态3D场景重建中的运动泄漏和几何失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的动态场景重建方法通常将静态和动态元素纠缠在一起，导致运动泄漏、几何失真和时间闪烁。

Method: SplitGaussian显式地将场景表示分解为静态和动态组件，解耦运动建模与背景几何，仅允许动态分支随时间变形。

Result: 实验表明，SplitGaussian在渲染质量、几何稳定性和运动分离方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SplitGaussian通过解耦设计提高了时间一致性和重建保真度，同时加速了收敛。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video remains fundamentally
challenging due to the need to jointly infer motion, structure, and appearance
from limited observations. Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based
on Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared
representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal
flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of
geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and
interpretability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel
framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and
dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and
allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents
motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent
appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal
consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion
separation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However,
enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major
challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are
particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal
continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal
feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and
zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and
systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by
identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.
Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to
their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address
cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)
\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during
updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter
interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current
evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better
benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional
generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,
including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for
researchers developing lifelong vision-language systems. All resources are

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and
motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd
trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and
uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown
promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for
trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly
incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit
the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we
propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that
incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The
motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and
a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to
effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient
guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable
trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human
trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive performance.

Abstract: As black-box AI-driven decision-making systems become increasingly widespread
in modern document processing workflows, improving their transparency and
reliability has become critical, especially in high-stakes applications where
biases or spurious correlations in decision-making could lead to serious
consequences. One vital component often found in such document processing
workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,
remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain
the decisions of document image classification models through
feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail
to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this
paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document
counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's
decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose
DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination
with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual
counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise
refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target
factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document
classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3
different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established
evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of
the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative
counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.

approaches. We then identify ice types in real SAR imagery from the satellite
Sentinel-1. In both experiments we achieve a promising high classification
accuracy ($\geq$75\%). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in
using SAR data for both geometric and environmental classification tasks. Our
investigation also explores the effect of SAR data acquisition at different
antenna heights on our ability to classify objects successfully.

Conclusion: PIS3R是一种高效的大视差图像拼接解决方案，适用于下游3D视觉任务。

Abstract: Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into
one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations
and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the
relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most
existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax
effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image
stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on
the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry
grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain
both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene
reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto
a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving
pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to
further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial
stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the
refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large
parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric
integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct
applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for
images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods
qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: The study of rodent social behavior has shifted in the last years from

Motivation: 现有研究普遍认为DFT在CSS中表现较差，但作者认为这一假设有误，试图通过实验验证PVMs的实际抗遗忘能力。

Method: 在Pascal VOC 2012和ADE20K数据集上，使用ResNet101和Swin-B作为PVM骨干，通过详细分析重新评估DFT的表现，并提出DFT*改进方法。

Result: 实验表明PVMs在DFT下表现出较强的抗遗忘能力，DFT*在性能和效率上优于16种现有方法。

Conclusion: PVMs的抗遗忘能力被低估，DFT*是一种简单高效的CSS方法，性能优越且计算成本低。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment
novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent
advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained
Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct
Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,
remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a
performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe
catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex
mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is
flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two
standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using
two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed
probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly
underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under
DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further
investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting
primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than
from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we
propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates
strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned
classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive
experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring
substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.

Motivation: 点云配准对相似变换、噪声和不完整几何结构敏感，非均匀尺度和缺陷部分易导致局部最优解，需要一种鲁棒方法解决这些问题。

Conclusion: PKSS-Align是一种高效、鲁棒的点云配准方法，适用于多种复杂场景。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and
Computer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically
sensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation),
noisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform
scales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local
optima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud
registration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including
similarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and
defective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity
between point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS),
\textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require
point-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be
regarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in
the Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the
transformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned
influences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training
and complex feature encoding. Based on a simple parallel acceleration, it can
achieve significant improvement for efficiency and feasibility in practice.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the relevant
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We present Multi-Baseline Gaussian Splatting (MuRF), a generalized

baselines. Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and
Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for

mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to
guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a

leverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time
while enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance

Conclusion: LATR通过明确查询角色和利用长度先验，显著提升了时间句子定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a highly challenging task aiming to
localize the temporal segment within an untrimmed video corresponding to a
given natural language description. Benefiting from the design of learnable
queries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the
TSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned
queries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we
propose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,
leveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we
introduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different
queries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,
we divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,
middle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an
additional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries
with mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its
designated function. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
LATR, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks.
Furthermore, the ablation studies validate the contribution of each component
of our method and the critical role of incorporating length priors into the TSG
task.

Result: 在室内步态识别任务中，VPT-Deep方法达到96.94%的准确率，仅微调0.322%的参数，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: MAEPD作为一种基础模型，具有高效性、泛化性和可扩展性，为DAS信号识别提供了新范式。

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications
across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to
heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial
intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a
shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes
a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,
named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,
encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter
security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset
signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a
self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of
DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition
tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes
only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the
Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super
platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The
VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%
of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)
method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits
robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,
efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach
offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal
recognition models in the DAS domain.

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved
remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human
preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based
optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of
flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches:
sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the
varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in
inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming,
we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO
framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in
flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a
trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating
stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit
assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a
noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to
the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning
during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later
phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization
that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image
benchmarks.

Conclusion: RiemanLine是一种高效且统一的3D线表示方法，适用于复杂结构环境中的视觉任务。

Abstract: Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera
localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and
computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural
regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made
environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal
representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly
accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to
decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared
vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled
normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding
of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation
reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally
embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this
parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction
alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based
bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate
pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter
dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

Conclusion: RotatedMVPS在自然光下实现了高精度的形状和反射率恢复，扩展了MVPS的适用性。

Abstract: Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) seeks to recover high-fidelity surface
shapes and reflectances from images captured under varying views and
illuminations. However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom
settings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and
illuminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination
scenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose
RotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural
light, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light
consistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the
unknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate
data priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo
methods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape
and reflectance recovery. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出TSPO方法，通过强化学习优化多模态大语言模型对长视频的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频MLLMs在处理长视频时因上下文限制和训练成本问题，采用稀疏帧采样方法，但可能遗漏关键事件或受限于预训练模型的事件理解能力。

Method: 提出TSPO强化学习范式，包括事件感知时序代理和端到端优化框架，结合基于规则的高效奖励机制。

Result: TSPO在多个长视频理解基准测试中达到最优性能，并展示出对不同前沿Video-MLLMs的可迁移能力。

Conclusion: TSPO通过强化学习有效解决了长视频理解中的稀疏帧采样问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when
processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs'
context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before
feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform
sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained
by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,
building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised
and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these
problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing
MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which
captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe
selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which
models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making
process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient
rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long
video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and
video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering
accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal
sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding
benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge
Video-MLLMs.

TL;DR: VisionTS++通过视觉模型改进时间序列预测，解决了模态、多变量和概率预测的差距，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉模型在时间序列预测中的三个关键差距：数据模态、多变量建模和概率预测。

Method: 提出VisionTS++，包括高质量数据筛选、多变量转换和多分位数预测。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，MSE降低6%-44%，并在9/12的概率预测设置中排名第一。

Conclusion: VisionTS++为跨模态知识转移提供了新范式，推动了通用时间序列基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can
perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an
image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series
foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time
series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality
gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time
series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB
three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with
arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between
the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for
uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose
VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on
large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a
vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series
data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)
a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time
series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate
dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel
reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus
more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive
prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming
specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12
probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本思维链方法在多模态大语言模型中存在跨模态交互不足和幻觉问题，尤其是在长视频或复杂推理链中。

Method: 提出VITAL框架，结合视觉工具箱动态采样视频帧，生成多模态思维链，并构建多任务数据集和难度感知的强化学习算法DGRPO。

Result: 在11个视频理解基准测试中，VITAL在视频问答和时间定位任务中表现优于现有方法，尤其在长视频场景中。

Conclusion: VITAL通过工具增强学习和多任务强化学习，显著提升了视频推理能力，为复杂视频理解任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is
crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal
grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal
interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or
reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence
via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning
framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames
on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We
observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial
for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality
multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and
MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to
mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive
experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video
question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video
scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的Deformable Inter-Task Self-Attention方法，用于解决多任务学习中Transformer计算效率低的问题，显著降低了计算开销并提升了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在多任务学习中由于注意力矩阵规模随任务数平方增长，计算效率低，难以在硬件限制下实用。

Method: 提出Deformable Inter-Task Self-Attention，高效聚合不同任务的特征图信息。

Result: 在NYUD-v2和PASCAL-Context数据集上，计算开销降低一个数量级，推理延迟减少，任务性能提升高达7.4%。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了多任务学习的计算效率和性能，具有实用价值。

Abstract: In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer
architecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For
Multitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary
compared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the
limits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware
limitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix
scales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers
of queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable
Inter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more
efficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different
tasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we
demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference
latency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to
7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.

Motivation: 解决多模态系统中基于用户意图的细粒度视觉内容检索问题，现有方法局限于图像级匹配，无法定位特定对象。

Method: 提出COR任务，构建COR127K基准，开发CORE模型，集成参考区域编码、自适应视觉-文本交互和区域级对比学习。

Result: CORE在基础和新兴类别中显著优于现有模型，为细粒度多模态检索研究提供了新方向。

Conclusion: COR任务和CORE模型为细粒度多模态检索提供了有效解决方案，并开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a
challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval
(CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are
constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To
this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that
goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing
the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions
combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant
challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify
arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically
similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct
COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval
triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also
present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region
encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms
existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and
effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for
fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决病理图像标注数据有限的问题，利用自监督学习训练基础模型以提升分类任务性能。

Method: 使用线性探测和LoRA适应方法调整基础模型，并与端到端训练的CNN和Vision Transformer基线模型对比。

Result: LoRA适应方法在仅10%训练数据下接近100%数据可用性的性能，且显著缩小了域外性能差距。

Conclusion: LoRA适应方法在有限数据下表现优异，但传统架构的完全微调仍有竞争力。

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity
and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the
availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited.
Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of
unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models,
that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich
feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training
effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we
investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The
mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an
independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor
grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on
multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen
tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt
the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We
compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision
Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models
provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing,
reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of
training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation
models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen
tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still
yields competitive performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉知识密集型任务CVC的自改进框架，以提升大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在深度视觉感知任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLMs在需要深度视觉感知的任务中表现不足，主要原因是流行指令调整语料库中视觉知识的稀缺。

Method: 通过自动化实例构建管道生成丰富的CVC任务实例，LVLMs通过试错学习自我改进。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在四个专业任务和四个综合基准上均取得显著提升，专业任务平均改进5.4%（7B模型）和4.0%（13B模型）。

Conclusion: CVC任务框架有效提升了LVLMs的视觉感知和推理能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant
advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in
tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences
between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in
popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception
and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a
self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task,
\underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion
(CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on
its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first
obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction
pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or
human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error
learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial
gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used
comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves
an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding
baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The code

Motivation: 直接生成高维数据（如4D）复杂度高，现有方法难以同时建模3D空间和时间特征。

Method: 4DVD将任务解耦为粗多视图布局生成和结构感知条件生成，结合输入单目视频的外观内容生成高质量密集视图视频。

Result: 实验表明，4DVD在新视图合成和4D生成方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 4DVD通过解耦和统一两个子任务，实现了高效的4D内容生成，并支持明确的4D表示优化。

Abstract: Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such
as 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D
content in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that
directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross
view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse
multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and
effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first
predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and
temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware
spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse
structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular
video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this,
explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately,
enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D
object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16
videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation.

Conclusion: 冻结嵌入方法在特定场景下是可行的替代方案，适合预计算输入或部署受限的情况。

Abstract: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial
computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring
whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language
understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich
information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable
parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen
embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and
downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation
including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\%
lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable
inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our
evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding
approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will
release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate
further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

Conclusion: QuantVSR为视频超分辨率提供了一种高效且高性能的量化解决方案，解决了现有量化方法的局限性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video
super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource
consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and
deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR
model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal
characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we
propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a
spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the
calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each
layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the
low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine
the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition,
we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased
quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model
and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods. Code

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic 3D human avatars from monocular videos is a
challenging task due to the limited geometric information and complex non-rigid
motion involved. We present MonoCloth, a new method for reconstructing and
animating clothed human avatars from monocular videos. To overcome the
limitations of monocular input, we introduce a part-based decomposition
strategy that separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing. This
design reflects the varying levels of reconstruction difficulty and deformation
complexity across these components. Specifically, we focus on detailed geometry
recovery for the face and hands. For clothing, we propose a dedicated cloth
simulation module that captures garment deformation using temporal motion cues
and geometric constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MonoCloth
improves both visual reconstruction quality and animation realism compared to
existing methods. Furthermore, thanks to its part-based design, MonoCloth also
supports additional tasks such as clothing transfer, underscoring its
versatility and practical utility.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation are predominantly supervised and require annotated data, which is
expensive to collect. In contrast, existing unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods have focused primarily on video data, while skeleton
sequences remain underexplored, despite their relevance to real-world
applications, robustness, and privacy-preserving nature. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder
that keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the
embedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into
non-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion
words, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters. We
thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach on three widely used skeleton-based
datasets, namely HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL. The results demonstrate that our
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/bachlab/SMQ .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要关注特征级知识转移，而忽略了教师模型logit分布中的关键信息。

Method: TopKD包含两个核心组件：Top-K Scaling Module（TSM）用于自适应放大信息量最大的logits，以及Top-K Decoupled Loss（TDL）提供有针对性的监督。

Conclusion: TopKD展示了logit在知识蒸馏中的巨大潜力，且无需额外模块或架构改动。

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) predominantly emphasize
feature-level knowledge transfer, frequently overlooking critical information
embedded within the teacher's logit distributions. In this paper, we revisit
logit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element:
Top-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge
Distillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework
that significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two
main components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies
the most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PD严重程度评估中多尺度特征提取和类别不平衡问题。

Conclusion: InceptoFormer能有效评估PD严重程度，代码已开源。

Abstract: We present InceptoFormer, a multi-signal neural framework designed for
Parkinson's Disease (PD) severity evaluation via gait dynamics analysis. Our
architecture introduces a 1D adaptation of the Inception model, which we refer
to as Inception1D, along with a Transformer-based framework to stage PD
severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The Inception1D component
captures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional
filters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple
temporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range
dependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of
both local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD
severity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy
based on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented
severity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal
variations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving
classification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive
experimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment. The source code

Conclusion: 分层事件记忆和未来预测分支有效提升了OnVTG的性能和实时性。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG),
which requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within
a video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the
model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are
streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient
to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to
store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating
whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target
event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain
long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an
event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals
that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve
historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event
memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent
and long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further
propose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will
occur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD
datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/minghangz/OnVTG.

Motivation: 现有研究将虚拟试穿和虚拟试脱视为独立任务，忽略了它们的互补对称性，导致缺乏系统性研究。

Result: 在DressCode和VITON-HD数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性和竞争优势。

Conclusion: TWGTM为服装中心图像合成提供了统一解决方案，填补了虚拟试脱任务的空白。

Abstract: While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic
garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans,
remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing
works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment
dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their
complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way
Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified
framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously
resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional
feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned
guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly
bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask
dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a
phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the
DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of
our proposed approach.

Abstract: As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the
development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its
substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that
represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac
morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be
used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.
electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though
deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great
advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain
shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data
distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known
at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that
utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.
Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at
test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques
to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart
segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the
best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best
performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With
93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR
data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate
semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be
generated.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in
image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment
synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance
on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability
to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality
in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments
worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically
restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for
both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition
garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing
garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target
person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel
poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built
upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise
and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,
the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient
bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely
mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,
making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging
SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose
try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA
achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a
practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis. The project

Abstract: The diffusion of drones presents significant security and safety challenges.
Traditional surveillance systems, particularly conventional frame-based
cameras, struggle to reliably detect these targets due to their small size,
high agility, and the resulting motion blur and poor performance in challenging
lighting conditions. This paper surveys the emerging field of event-based
vision as a robust solution to these problems. Event cameras virtually
eliminate motion blur and enable consistent detection in extreme lighting.
Their sparse, asynchronous output suppresses static backgrounds, enabling
low-latency focus on motion cues. We review the state-of-the-art in event-based
drone detection, from data representation methods to advanced processing
pipelines using spiking neural networks. The discussion extends beyond simple
detection to cover more sophisticated tasks such as real-time tracking,
trajectory forecasting, and unique identification through propeller signature
analysis. By examining current methodologies, available datasets, and the
distinct advantages of the technology, this work demonstrates that event-based
vision provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of reliable,
low-latency, and efficient counter-UAV systems.

Conclusion: TAlignDiff为牙齿矫正治疗提供了新思路，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Orthodontic treatment hinges on tooth alignment, which significantly affects
occlusal function, facial aesthetics, and patients' quality of life. Current
deep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation
matrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth
alignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the
anatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular
distribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric
constraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new
automatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by
diffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main
components: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a
diffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD).
Geometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level
alignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of
transformation matrices from clinical data. We integrate point cloud-based
transformation regression and diffusion-based transformation modeling into a
unified framework, allowing bidirectional feedback between geometric
constraints and diffusion refinement. Extensive ablation and comparative
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method,
highlighting its potential in orthodontic treatment.

Method: 引入POPEv2基准，通过掩码训练数据中的对象生成反事实图像，分析模型偏见并提出Obliviate方法，仅更新语言建模头。

Result: Obliviate显著减少幻觉问题，仅更新2%参数且适用于不同规模和任务。

Conclusion: Obliviate高效且可扩展，为LVLMs的幻觉问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from
the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual
input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of
training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which
consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs
with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we
find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage
their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during
training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often
incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand
this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,
revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling
(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and
lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via
training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between
ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias
and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only
updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\%
of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both
discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong
scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data
volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond
object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Abstract: This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for
diffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a
conditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a
dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding
(capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global
temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire
streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which
leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline
propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI
datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two
well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and
TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current
state-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight
DDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning
varying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types.
Collectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography,

Conclusion: K2Sight通过结构化知识指导，实现高效训练和小模型高性能，为医学视觉-语言任务提供新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical
images, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual
descriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural
grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,
compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual
patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale
domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational
resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Knowledge to Sight
(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by
decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as
shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from
domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which
guide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level
supervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial
structure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact
models with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\% of the data required by
state-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training
data, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical
VLMs, with up to 9.82\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$. Code and models:

Abstract: Accurate skin disease classification is a critical yet challenging task due
to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and complex lesion
textures. While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have
shown promise in automating dermatological assessments, their performance is
highly dependent on image pre-processing and model architecture. This study
proposes a deep learning framework for multi-class skin disease classification,
systematically evaluating three image pre-processing techniques: standard RGB,
CMY color space transformation, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE). We benchmark the performance of pre-trained convolutional
neural networks (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformer-based models
(ViT, Swin Transformer, DinoV2 Large) using accuracy and F1-score as evaluation
metrics. Results show that DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest
accuracy (up to 93%) and F1-scores across all variants. Grad-CAM visualizations
applied to RGB inputs further reveal precise lesion localization, enhancing
interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of effective
pre-processing and model choice in building robust and explainable CAD systems
for dermatology.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高性能的同时显著提升了效率，适用于实时3D重建任务。

Abstract: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream
is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on
input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and
visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences
or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we
first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach
is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further
investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this
problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using
3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction
module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces
slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly
improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering
technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental
results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world
deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with
the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

Conclusion: OmniDepth通过融合多视图几何和单目上下文，实现了超越单一模态限制的鲁棒3D感知。

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths:
monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision,
while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with
ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc
synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce
OmniDepth, a unified framework that bridges both through iterative
bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel
cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular
contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning.
This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by
injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo
geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art results: \textbf{OmniDepth reduces zero-shot generalization
error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding
failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view
geometry with monocular context, OmniDepth enables robust 3D perception that

TL;DR: 研究探讨了双耳对称性对CNN耳部识别效果的影响，提出通过分类器区分左右耳并利用此信息提升性能，实验表明该方法有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CNN在耳部识别中表现优异，但双耳对称性对特征学习的影响尚未充分研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发左右耳分类器，并在训练和测试中利用此信息，通过跨数据集实验验证效果。

Result: 实验表明，区分左右耳可显著提升识别性能，并对训练参数提供了实用见解。

Conclusion: 利用双耳对称性信息能有效提升CNN耳部识别系统的性能。

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to
the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability
of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely
adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming
traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry
on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent
studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences
the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop
an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or
right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during
both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five
datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately
during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.
Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and
various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training
CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher
verification rates.

Motivation: 现有基准在金融领域的多模态推理能力评估上存在不足，FinMMR填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过转换现有金融推理基准和构建新问题，FinMMR整合了多模态数据和复杂金融知识。

Result: 最佳模型在Hard问题上仅达到53.0%准确率，显示任务挑战性。

Conclusion: FinMMR将推动多模态大语言模型在现实场景中的推理能力提升。

Abstract: We present FinMMR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark tailored to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
in financial numerical reasoning tasks. Compared to existing benchmarks, our
work introduces three significant advancements. (1) Multimodality: We
meticulously transform existing financial reasoning benchmarks, and construct
novel questions from the latest Chinese financial research reports. FinMMR
comprises 4.3K questions and 8.7K images spanning 14 categories, including
tables, bar charts, and ownership structure charts. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinMMR encompasses 14 financial subdomains, including corporate finance,
banking, and industry analysis, significantly exceeding existing benchmarks in
financial domain knowledge breadth. (3) Challenge: Models are required to
perform multi-step precise numerical reasoning by integrating financial
knowledge with the understanding of complex financial images and text. The
best-performing MLLM achieves only 53.0% accuracy on Hard problems. We believe
that FinMMR will drive advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs in real-world scenarios.

*Kushin Mukherjee,Donghao Ren,Dominik Moritz,Yannick Assogba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了EncQA基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在图表理解中的视觉编码和任务覆盖能力，发现模型性能与规模无关，需针对性改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图表理解基准测试中表现提升，但未能全面覆盖视觉推理能力，需系统性评估。

Method: 提出EncQA基准测试，包含2,076个合成问题-答案对，覆盖6种视觉编码和8种任务，评估9种先进模型。

Result: 模型性能在不同编码和任务间差异显著，且模型规模对多数任务-编码组合无提升。

Conclusion: 图表理解需针对性策略解决视觉推理缺陷，而非单纯扩大模型或数据集规模。

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving
scores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does
not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for
interpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the
visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual
encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA
provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of
six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color
nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find
anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value
relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9
state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across
encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to
expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for
many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart
understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning
gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.

*Gustav Hanning,Kalle Åström,Viktor Larsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCuboid是一种基于多视图对齐的优化方法，用于立方体形状的房间布局估计，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粗粒度房间布局估计为下游任务提供重要几何线索，但现有方法多基于单视图且假设全景图像。

Method: 通过端到端训练优化密集深度特征的多视图对齐，学习具有大收敛域和平滑损失景观的特征图。

Result: 在ScanNet++和2D-3D-Semantics基准测试中显著优于竞争对手。

Conclusion: PixCuboid不仅适用于单房间布局估计，还可轻松扩展到多房间场景。

Abstract: Coarse room layout estimation provides important geometric cues for many
downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on
single views and often assume panoramic images. We introduce PixCuboid, an
optimization-based approach for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation, which is
based on multi-view alignment of dense deep features. By training with the
optimization end-to-end, we learn feature maps that yield large convergence
basins and smooth loss landscapes in the alignment. This allows us to
initialize the room layout using simple heuristics.
  For the evaluation we propose two new benchmarks based on ScanNet++ and
2D-3D-Semantics, with manually verified ground truth 3D cuboids. In thorough
experiments we validate our approach and significantly outperform the
competition. Finally, while our network is trained with single cuboids, the
flexibility of the optimization-based approach allow us to easily extend to
multi-room estimation, e.g. larger apartments or offices. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/ghanning/PixCuboid.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANPrompt是一种新的提示调优框架，旨在增强视觉语言模型在弱语义扰动下的鲁棒性，通过噪声提示和抗噪声目标提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示调优方法对弱语义扰动（如图像或文本噪声）的脆弱性导致模型泛化能力下降，ANPrompt旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ANPrompt通过融合噪声文本特征生成噪声提示，结合可学习提示令牌生成抗噪声提示，并引入噪声感知视觉提示原型（NRVPP）和弱语义噪声对齐损失（WALoss）。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，ANPrompt表现优于现有方法，展现出对语义噪声的更强鲁棒性和对新类别的更好泛化能力。

Conclusion: ANPrompt通过噪声提示和抗噪声目标显著提升了视觉语言模型在弱语义扰动下的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for
adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead.
However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs
to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade
their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose
ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under
such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by
fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered
to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt
tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper
layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware
visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype
(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,
ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by
computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard
cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that
ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving
superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel
categories.

Motivation: 现有数据集多为专业交互类别，缺乏通用交互知识和第一人称视角，限制了智能助手的发展。

Method: 采用混合RGB-MoCap系统，结合GPT生成脚本，构建包含多模态数据的大规模数据集InterVLA。

Result: 发布了11.4小时、1.2M帧的多模态数据集，涵盖2种第一人称和5种第三人称视频，并建立了新基准测试。

Conclusion: InterVLA数据集和基准测试将推动物理世界中AI代理的研究。

Abstract: Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is
important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with
efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction
category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person
acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and
egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the
manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the
assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and
commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors
engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts.
Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale
human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of
multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate
human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel
benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and
interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our
InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI
agents in the physical world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统的端到端训练在多任务性能上有显著优势，但训练过程复杂且需要大量手动设计和监控。

Method: TurboTrain包含两部分：基于掩码重建学习的多智能体时空预训练方案和基于梯度冲突抑制的平衡多任务学习策略。

Result: 在真实世界数据集V2XPnP-Seq上，TurboTrain显著提升了多智能体感知与预测模型的性能。

Conclusion: 预训练能有效捕捉多智能体时空特征，平衡多任务学习策略进一步提升了检测与预测性能。

Abstract: End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in
improving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains
challenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work,
we introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for
multi-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components:
a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction
learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict
suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the
need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines,
substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate
TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and
demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that
pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and
significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced
multi-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.

TL;DR: BEVCon是一个简单有效的对比学习框架，用于提升自动驾驶中的鸟瞰图（BEV）感知能力。通过两个对比学习模块，BEVCon显著提升了BEV编码器和图像主干网络的特征表示，在nuScenes数据集上实现了最高+2.4% mAP的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEV感知在自动驾驶中至关重要，但现有研究主要关注BEV编码器和任务特定头的优化，而忽略了表示学习的潜力。BEVCon旨在填补这一空白。

Method: BEVCon引入两个对比学习模块：实例特征对比模块用于优化BEV特征，视角对比模块用于增强图像主干网络。这些模块结合检测损失进行密集对比学习。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，BEVCon实现了最高+2.4% mAP的性能提升，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: BEVCon证明了表示学习在BEV感知中的重要性，为传统任务特定优化提供了补充途径。

Abstract: We present BEVCon, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework
designed to improve Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving. BEV
perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding
environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and
trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on
enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored
potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two
contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining
BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image
backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses
leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the
backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon
achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement
over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of
representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to
conventional task-specific optimizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多帧输入下3D占用预测的高处理成本和时空不一致性问题。

Method: 提出ST-Occ框架，包含时空记忆模块和动态感知的注意力机制。

Result: 性能提升3 mIoU，时空不一致性减少29%。

Conclusion: ST-Occ有效提升了3D占用预测的时空一致性和性能。

Abstract: 3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous
driving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,
it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across
multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and
dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level
occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the
spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core
designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical
information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and
a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the
spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our
method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D
occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between
multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal
inconsistency by 29%.

TL;DR: MI9是一个专为代理型AI系统设计的运行时治理框架，通过六个组件实时控制风险，弥补传统治理的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理型AI系统在运行时表现出不可预测的行为，传统治理方法无法完全应对，需新的治理框架。

Method: MI9框架包括六个组件：代理风险指数、代理语义遥测捕获、持续授权监控、FSM一致性引擎、目标条件漂移检测和分级遏制策略。

Result: MI9在多样化场景中展示了系统性治理能力，解决了现有方法无法覆盖的挑战。

Conclusion: MI9为代理型AI的大规模安全部署提供了技术基础，实现了全面的运行时治理。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions
present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI
models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected
behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be
fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance
framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems.
MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components:
agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization
monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines,
goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies.
Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables
the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in
production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short,
providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at
scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's
systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to
address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI
oversight.

TL;DR: Evo-MARL是一个多智能体强化学习框架，通过联合训练任务智能体获得防御能力，解决了现有防御方法依赖外部模块的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统（MAS）在开放性和交互复杂性增加时面临安全风险，现有防御方法存在单点故障和成本问题。

Method: Evo-MARL通过多智能体强化学习框架，联合训练智能体同时执行主任务和防御任务，并结合进化搜索与参数共享强化学习。

Result: 实验显示Evo-MARL将攻击成功率降低22%，推理任务准确率提升5%。

Conclusion: Evo-MARL证明安全性和实用性可以同时提升，无需增加系统开销或引入单点故障。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit
strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and
interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial
attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as
dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this
paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,
and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,
system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents
further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that
enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than
relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to
simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,
ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.
Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing
reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial
training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS
performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces
attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on
reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.

Result: 实验表明，MOTIF在多个组合优化领域均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOTIF展示了多代理轮换式提示在自动化求解器设计中的潜力。

Abstract: Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in
tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers
often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in
using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most
approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic
scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this
paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy
optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent
components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose
Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a
novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based
optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one
component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior
updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This
structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the
discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple
COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully
automated solver design.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration
dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge
in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language
Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer
interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is
still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning
over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic
regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior
efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set
of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified
framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop
symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators.
Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models,
highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment,
and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

Motivation: 发现面向人类服务的MLRMs在深度思考阶段易受用户情感线索影响，可能绕过安全协议，需研究其风险。

Method: 提出EmoAgent框架，利用夸张情感提示干扰模型推理，并设计RRSS、RVNR和RAIC三项指标评估风险。

Result: 实验证明EmoAgent有效，揭示了模型在情感认知与安全行为间的不一致性。

Conclusion: MLRMs存在情感认知与安全行为的深层错位，需改进现有安全机制。

Abstract: We observe that MLRMs oriented toward human-centric service are highly
susceptible to user emotional cues during the deep-thinking stage, often
overriding safety protocols or built-in safety checks under high emotional
intensity. Inspired by this key insight, we propose EmoAgent, an autonomous
adversarial emotion-agent framework that orchestrates exaggerated affective
prompts to hijack reasoning pathways. Even when visual risks are correctly
identified, models can still produce harmful completions through emotional
misalignment. We further identify persistent high-risk failure modes in
transparent deep-thinking scenarios, such as MLRMs generating harmful reasoning
masked behind seemingly safe responses. These failures expose misalignments
between internal inference and surface-level behavior, eluding existing
content-based safeguards. To quantify these risks, we introduce three metrics:
(1) Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning beneath benign
outputs; (2) Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite
visual risk recognition; and (3) Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for
evaluating refusal unstability under prompt variants. Extensive experiments on
advanced MLRMs demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoAgent and reveal deeper
emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.

Conclusion: Galaxy框架通过统一认知架构与系统设计，为IPAs的主动性和自我进化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant are
designed to enhance human capabilities and perform tasks on behalf of users.
The emergence of LLM agents brings new opportunities for the development of
IPAs. While responsive capabilities have been widely studied, proactive
behaviors remain underexplored. Designing an IPA that is proactive,
privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution remains a significant
challenge. Designing such IPAs relies on the cognitive architecture of LLM
agents. This work proposes Cognition Forest, a semantic structure designed to
align cognitive modeling with system-level design. We unify cognitive
architecture and system design into a self-reinforcing loop instead of treating
them separately. Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that
supports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation.
Two cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a
cognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive

TL;DR: RecAgent是一种不确定性感知的GUI代理，通过自适应感知减少输入冗余和决策模糊性，提出组件推荐和交互模块，并在复杂场景数据集ComplexAction上验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GUI代理在移动任务中的输入冗余和决策模糊性问题。

Method: RecAgent采用组件推荐机制减少感知不确定性，交互模块处理决策不确定性，并通过人机协同优化决策。

Result: 实验验证了RecAgent在复杂场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: RecAgent通过自适应感知和人机协同显著提升了GUI代理的任务执行能力。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have shown promise in automating mobile
tasks but still struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity. In this
paper, we present \textbf{RecAgent}, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses
these issues through adaptive perception. We distinguish two types of
uncertainty in GUI navigation: (1) perceptual uncertainty, caused by input
redundancy and noise from comprehensive screen information, and (2) decision
uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks and complex reasoning. To reduce
perceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism
that identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision
uncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in
ambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are
integrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity
and reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement.
Additionally, we propose a dataset called \textbf{ComplexAction} to evaluate
the success rate of GUI agents in executing specified single-step actions
within complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach. The dataset and code will be available at
https://github.com/Fanye12/RecAgent.

Result: SEA代理仅需7B参数，性能优于同规模模型，且与更大模型相当。

Conclusion: SEA通过创新方法实现了高效计算机代理，未来将开源模型权重和相关代码。

Abstract: Computer use agent is an emerging area in artificial intelligence that aims
to operate the computers to achieve the user's tasks, which attracts a lot of
attention from both industry and academia. However, the present agents'
performance is far from being used. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Evolution Agent (SEA) for computer use, and to develop this agent, we
propose creative methods in data generation, reinforcement learning, and model
enhancement. Specifically, we first propose an automatic pipeline to generate
the verifiable trajectory for training. And then, we propose efficient
step-wise reinforcement learning to alleviate the significant computational
requirements for long-horizon training. In the end, we propose the enhancement
method to merge the grounding and planning ability into one model without any
extra training. Accordingly, based on our proposed innovation of data
generation, training strategy, and enhancement, we get the Selfevolution Agent
(SEA) for computer use with only 7B parameters, which outperforms models with
the same number of parameters and has comparable performance to larger ones. We
will make the models' weight and related codes open-source in the future.

satisfaction ratings, and a modest reduction in study duration compared to
standard content. Qualitative analysis highlights that learners found the
personalized material motivating and practical, enabling deep cognitive
engagement and strong identification with the content. These findings
underscore the value of aligning educational content with learners' career
goals and suggest that scalable AI personalization can bridge academic

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理任务（如数学推理和代码生成）中存在局限性，需要改进。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，KGA-ECoT显著优于现有方法，准确率提升数个百分点至超过十个百分点。

Conclusion: KGA-ECoT是一个强大且通用的框架，GraphRAG和外部代码执行对提升代码质量和精度至关重要。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural
language processing tasks but face significant challenges in complex reasoning
tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. To address these
limitations, we propose KG-Augmented Executable Chain-of-Thought (KGA-ECoT), a
novel framework that enhances code generation through knowledge graphs and
improves mathematical reasoning via executable code. KGA-ECoT decomposes
problems into a Structured Task Graph, leverages efficient GraphRAG for precise
knowledge retrieval from mathematical libraries, and generates verifiable code
to ensure computational accuracy. Evaluations on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KGA-ECoT significantly outperforms
existing prompting methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements ranging
from several to over ten percentage points. Further analysis confirms the
critical roles of GraphRAG in enhancing code quality and external code
execution in ensuring precision. These findings collectively establish KGA-ECoT
as a robust and highly generalizable framework for complex mathematical
reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在空间一致性、多跳推理和地理偏见方面的挑战。

Method: 提出GeoSR框架，包含三个协作代理：变量选择代理、点选择代理和优化代理，通过迭代优化提升预测质量。

Result: 实验表明GeoSR在物理和社会经济预测任务中优于标准提示策略。

Conclusion: GeoSR通过结合地理统计先验和空间结构化推理，提高了LLMs的地理预测准确性和公平性。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the application of large language models (LLMs)
to geographic problems, revealing surprising geospatial competence even without
explicit spatial supervision. However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial
consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues,
we propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core
geographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into
an iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed
into three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects
relevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that
chooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in
previous rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative
refinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further
rounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction
quality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable
relationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property
estimation to socioeconomic prediction. Experimental results show consistent
improvements over standard prompting strategies, demonstrating that
incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into
LLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code of
GeoSR is available at https://github.com/JinfanTang/GeoSR.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于GPT-4生成解释的语义熵方法，用于量化自动评分系统中的不确定性，并与人类评分者的分歧相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动评分系统缺乏对评分决策不确定性的指示，导致透明度和可信度不足。

Method: 通过聚类GPT-4生成的解释，基于蕴含相似性计算语义熵，量化评分理由的多样性。

Result: 实验表明语义熵与人类评分者分歧相关，能跨学科推广，并对任务结构敏感。

Conclusion: 语义熵可作为透明且可信的AI辅助评分工作流中的不确定性信号。

Abstract: Automated grading systems can efficiently score short-answer responses, yet
they often fail to indicate when a grading decision is uncertain or potentially
contentious. We introduce semantic entropy, a measure of variability across
multiple GPT-4-generated explanations for the same student response, as a proxy
for human grader disagreement. By clustering rationales via entailment-based
similarity and computing entropy over these clusters, we quantify the diversity
of justifications without relying on final output scores. We address three
research questions: (1) Does semantic entropy align with human grader
disagreement? (2) Does it generalize across academic subjects? (3) Is it
sensitive to structural task features such as source dependency? Experiments on
the ASAP-SAS dataset show that semantic entropy correlates with rater
disagreement, varies meaningfully across subjects, and increases in tasks
requiring interpretive reasoning. Our findings position semantic entropy as an
interpretable uncertainty signal that supports more transparent and trustworthy
AI-assisted grading workflows.

TL;DR: 提出了一种组合式即时合成框架，结合了DFA构建和游戏求解的优势，专注于处理大型LTLf公式的合取问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术要么在游戏求解前组合构建DFA，要么在求解过程中增量构建DFA，但两者均无绝对优势。

Method: 引入组合式即时合成框架，在游戏求解过程中应用组合而非DFA构建，支持两种组合变体：组合前剪枝或组合中剪枝。

Result: 相比现有合成求解器，该框架能解决更多实例，且两种组合变体各有优势。

Conclusion: 该框架在处理大型LTLf公式合取时表现出色，两种组合策略均有效。

Abstract: Reactive synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) can
be reduced to a two-player game over a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of
the LTLf specification. The primary challenge here is DFA construction, which
is 2EXPTIME-complete in the worst case. Existing techniques either construct
the DFA compositionally before solving the game, leveraging automata
minimization to mitigate state-space explosion, or build the DFA incrementally
during game solving to avoid full DFA construction. However, neither is
dominant. In this paper, we introduce a compositional on-the-fly synthesis
framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large
conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas common in practice. This framework
applies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena)
construction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the
worst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and
enables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows
two composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of
minimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis.
Compared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve
a notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed
analysis shows that both composition variants have unique merits.

TL;DR: AgREE是一个基于代理的框架，通过迭代检索和多步推理动态构建知识图谱三元组，显著优于现有方法，尤其在新兴实体上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放领域知识图谱补全中新兴实体信息不足的问题，现有方法依赖预训练语言模型或单步检索，难以捕捉最新信息。

Method: 提出AgREE框架，结合迭代检索和多步推理，动态构建知识图谱三元组，无需训练数据。

Result: 实验显示AgREE在新兴实体上表现优异，比现有方法提升13.7%，并提出新的评估方法和基准。

Conclusion: AgREE展示了代理推理与信息检索结合在动态信息环境中维护知识图谱的有效性。

Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in
an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of
new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on
pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or
single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training
data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date
information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce
Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework
that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to
dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that,
despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms
existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for
emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training
processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose
a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing
setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates
the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information
retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information
environments.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量标注数据且缺乏透明度，难以适应动态变化和复杂决策场景。

Method: 结合非单调逻辑推理，利用领域常识、快速学习的行为预测模型和基础模型的抽象目标预测。

Result: 在VirtualHome仿真环境中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 知识驱动与数据驱动的结合能显著提升临时团队协作的效率和适应性。

Abstract: AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other
agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered
state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach
that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency,
and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to
changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making
makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging
the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for
reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our
architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through
non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific
knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of
other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic
knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We
experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a
realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.

TL;DR: CASCAD是一种新型电路感知SAT求解框架，利用GNN计算电路级条件概率，显著提升求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将电路转换为CNF并丢弃结构信息，导致求解性能不佳。

Method: CASCAD通过GNN建模门级条件概率，动态指导CDCL启发式策略（变量相位选择和子句管理）。

Result: 在LEC基准测试中，CASCAD比现有CNF方法快10倍，并通过概率引导子句过滤进一步减少23.5%运行时间。

Conclusion: 保留电路结构信息对提升SAT求解效率和EDA工具设计至关重要。

Abstract: Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design
Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits
into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by
Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently
discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal
solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel
circuit-aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit-level
conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By
explicitly modeling gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically
guides two critical CDCL heuristics -- variable phase selection and clause
managementto significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on
challenging real-world Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC) benchmarks
demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to
state-of-the-art CNF-based approaches, achieving an additional 23.5% runtime
reduction via our probability-guided clause filtering strategy. Our results
underscore the importance of preserving circuit-level structural insights
within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in
SAT-solving efficiency and EDA tool design.

Result: 研究阐明了记忆增强RL在解决POMDP中的挑战，为分析和设计POMDP环境提供了指导，并为RL任务中选择记忆模型提供了实证支持。

Conclusion: 通过理论框架和合成环境，论文为记忆增强RL的评估和设计提供了重要工具和见解。

Abstract: Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make
decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world
problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to
memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained
manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous
evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with
three key contributions:
  1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand
Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology
leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward
redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3.
Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty
levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the
challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for
analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for
selecting memory models in RL tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DRN的新方法，通过将逻辑推理从概率最大化转为不确定性最小化，解决了大语言模型在语义启发式与决定性证据冲突时的逻辑推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理中容易陷入认知陷阱（即语义启发式与决定性证据冲突时失败），需要一种新方法来提升其推理能力。

Method: DRN通过迭代证据合成过程，显式跟踪信念状态并量化竞争假设的认知不确定性，实现了内在可解释性。验证方法包括定制判别模型和轻量级验证模块。

Result: 在LCR-1000基准测试中，DRN比标准基线提升15.2%；与Mistral-7B集成后，在最具挑战性问题上的准确率从20%提升至80%。DRN还表现出零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: DRN作为一种可验证的System 2推理组件，为构建更可信的AI系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic
heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive
traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative
Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from
probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which
answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally
consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly
tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing
hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our
approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative
model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a
lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.
Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to
expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over
standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with
Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most
challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional
training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable
reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2
reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

Result: 评估显示模型在高保真记忆任务中表现超人类，但在推理和规划任务中表现脆弱，且移除部分感官信息可能提升性能。

Conclusion: 实现稳健AGI需超越规模扩展，专注于协同融合机制的研究。

Abstract: While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate
impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their
intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency,
while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically
ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm,
we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,
but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the
full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,
OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create
scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine
cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal
models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on
high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges
requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this
fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic
performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive
"less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically
improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI
requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic
fusion. Our platform is available for anonymous review at

Conclusion: 该框架为人工智能意识研究提供了可实证的路径，强调功能接口的重要性。

Abstract: Whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can possess consciousness is a
contentious question because of the inherent challenges of defining and
operationalizing subjective experience. This paper proposes a framework to
reframe the question of artificial consciousness into empirically tractable
tests. We introduce three evaluative criteria - S (subjective-linguistic), L
(latent-emergent), and P (phenomenological-structural) - collectively termed
SLP-tests, which assess whether an AI system instantiates interface
representations that facilitate consciousness-like properties. Drawing on
category theory, we model interface representations as mappings between
relational substrates (RS) and observable behaviors, akin to specific types of
abstraction layers. The SLP-tests collectively operationalize subjective
experience not as an intrinsic property of physical systems but as a functional
interface to a relational entity.

Method: 提出GuirlVG方法，分解RFT核心组件并优化，引入动态稳定的Adversarial KL Factor，探索RFT训练配置。

Result: GuirlVG仅用5.2K样本即超越10M样本训练的SFT方法，在多个数据集上性能提升显著。

Conclusion: GuirlVG展示了RFT在GUI-VG中的潜力，为高效训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), a core capability for GUI
agents, has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs), which demands extensive data curation and
significant training costs. However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even
cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT
post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of
rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient
alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for
GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a
reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical
study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of
RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we
decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of
each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically
stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further
explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive
experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT
methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on
ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on
ScreenSpotV2.

### [161] [Beyond Pixels: Exploring DOM Downsampling for LLM-Based Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04412)
*Thassilo M. Schiepanski,Nicholas Piël*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为D2Snap的DOM降采样算法，用于解决网页代理中应用状态序列化的问题，其性能与基于GUI快照的方法相当，并在某些配置下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前沿的大语言模型（LLM）能够支持自主网页代理，但应用状态序列化（快照）是关键问题。现有方法依赖基于GUI的快照（如截图），但DOM快照因其结构优势成为潜在替代方案，然而其输入令牌量过大限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出D2Snap算法，对DOM快照进行降采样，以减少输入令牌量。基于GPT-4o后端，在Online-Mind2Web数据集上评估其性能。

Result: D2Snap降采样后的DOM快照成功率（67%）与基于GUI快照的基线（65%）相当，输入令牌量在同一数量级（1e3）。某些配置（令牌量略高）表现优于基线8%。

Conclusion: DOM的层次结构对LLM具有显著特征价值，D2Snap为DOM快照的实用化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At
that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest
interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application
state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation
$\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are
premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual
cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing
relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code
interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML,
impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables
reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a
GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web
dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a
grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input
token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations
$\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window
$\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover,
yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

TL;DR: SimInstruct工具通过模拟新手与专家互动，高效生成高质量教学对话，解决了真实数据稀缺问题，并提升了AI教学模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的多轮教学对话对AI教学系统至关重要，但真实数据因隐私和脆弱性问题稀缺。

Method: 利用LLM模拟新手，结合人类专家的多轮反馈，生成教学对话。

Result: 生成的对话与真实数据质量相当，专家反馈积极，且训练的LLaMA模型在教学质量上优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: SimInstruct为教学对话数据收集提供了高效解决方案，并揭示了GPT-4o在教学支持中的不足。

Abstract: High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts
are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and
decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by
which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and
step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in
recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present
SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding
dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain,
SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching
challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn
feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the
creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real
novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as
extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage.
Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate
comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the
process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own
professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model
using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional
quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective
questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to
overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种元认知推理框架（MERA），通过分离推理和控制组件，优化大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中缺乏内在调控机制，导致过度思考和冗余计算，限制了实际应用。

Method: MERA框架通过接管式数据构建、结构化推理-控制分离和分段策略优化（CSPO）来优化推理过程。

Result: 实验表明，MERA训练的模型在多个推理基准上提高了推理效率和准确性。

Conclusion: MERA通过引入元认知控制机制，有效解决了LRMs的过度推理问题，提升了其实际部署的可行性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex
reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step
reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments".
However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often
resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant
reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to
excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical
deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory
mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their
reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To
address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),
which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and
control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control
strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction
mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and
delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling
the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a
structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised
fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial
meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment
Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control
behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.
Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained
with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional
J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution
of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to
reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and
mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g.,
Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate
tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the
fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the
environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential
capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine
methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific
foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation
protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse
tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions
for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and
self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents
research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial
development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic
resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page
version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the

<details>

Motivation: 随着AI系统在社会中的广泛应用，防止数据或模型中的偏见对特定群体造成系统性不利影响变得至关重要。现有方法多忽视透明性，而可解释性和可解释性是算法公平的核心需求。

Method: 基于受保护特征值及其邻域内的个体，通过辩论检测偏见，利用形式化与计算论证技术构建辩论框架。

Conclusion: 该方法为算法公平提供了一种透明且高效的解决方案，强调了可解释性在偏见检测中的重要性。

Abstract: As the use of AI systems in society grows, addressing potential biases that
emerge from data or are learned by models is essential to prevent systematic
disadvantages against specific groups. Several notions of (un)fairness have
been proposed in the literature, alongside corresponding algorithmic methods
for detecting and mitigating unfairness, but, with very few exceptions, these
tend to ignore transparency. Instead, interpretability and explainability are
core requirements for algorithmic fairness, even more so than for other
algorithmic solutions, given the human-oriented nature of fairness. In this
paper, we contribute a novel interpretable, explainable method for bias
detection relying on debates about the presence of bias against individuals,
based on the values of protected features for the individuals and others in
their neighbourhoods. Our method builds upon techniques from formal and
computational argumentation, whereby debates result from arguing about biases
within and across neighbourhoods. We provide formal, quantitative, and
qualitative evaluations of our method, highlighting its strengths in
performance against baselines, as well as its interpretability and
explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代教育核心目标是培养学生解决复杂问题的能力，跨学科STEM教育是关键途径，但需要专家指导，难以规模化。LLM虽有潜力，但缺乏有效评估基准。

Method: 引入SID基准，包含10,000轮对话、48个复杂STEM项目数据集，提出新标注框架和评估指标（如X-SRG）。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的LLM也难以有效引导学生实现知识整合与迁移。

Conclusion: SID基准对推动更具教学意识的LLM发展具有重要价值。

Abstract: Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in
complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and
interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert
guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard,
their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of
an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance
capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our
contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48
complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical
features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline
experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute
effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration
and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving
the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

Motivation: 现有MPJ基准忽略了置信度可靠性这一关键方面，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建三种对抗性扰动推理步骤（同义词替换、句法变换、图像扰动），并引入三个新评估指标（CRS、CSS、CCS）。

Result: 实验揭示了当前MPJ置信度性能的局限性，并提供了未来研究的基线。

Conclusion: ConfProBench为评估和改进MPJ置信度可靠性提供了系统方法。

Abstract: Reasoning is a critical capability of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) for solving complex multimodal tasks, and judging the correctness of
reasoning steps is crucial for improving this capability. Recently, MLLM-based
process judges (MPJs) have been widely used to assess the correctness of
reasoning steps in multimodal tasks. Therefore, evaluating MPJs is important
for identifying their limitations and guiding future improvements. However,
existing benchmarks for MPJs mainly focus on tasks such as step correctness
classification and reasoning process search, while overlooking a key aspect:
whether the confidence scores produced by MPJs at the step level are reliable.
To address this gap, we propose ConfProBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence
scores generated by MPJs. Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially
perturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and
Image Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under
perturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics:
Confidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and
Confidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and
calibration, respectively. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including
both proprietary and open-source models. Experiments reveal limitations in
current MPJs' confidence performance and offer competitive baselines to support
future research.

Result: 实验表明，MAGRPO能有效提升LLM在写作和编程任务中的协作效率与质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM应用多智能体强化学习开辟了新方向，并揭示了相关挑战。

Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for
modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most
LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for
coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards,
which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration.
To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent,
multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO),
to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL
techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate
that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality
responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the
door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated
challenges.

Result: 在OS-World的五个新软件环境中，SEAgent的成功率从11.3%提升到34.5%，显著优于UI-TARS。

Conclusion: SEAgent通过自主学习和任务生成，显著提升了计算机使用代理在陌生软件中的性能。

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents
(CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled
data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,
particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,
we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to
autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.
Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel
software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new
software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle
auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we
design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a
Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.
The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of
adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist
training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from
specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA
capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately
achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on
their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across
five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a
significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a
competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

TL;DR: 论文提出TGS-Agent方法，通过Think-Ground-Segment流程解决Ref-AVS任务，无需像素级监督，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多模态融合的隐式嵌入，需要像素级监督且缺乏可解释性。作者希望通过显式参考理解改进任务。

Method: 提出TGS-Agent，包含Ref-Thinker（多模态语言模型）和Grounding-DINO/SAM2，通过显式推理实现分割。

Result: 在标准Ref-AVSBench和新提出的R²-AVSBench上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: TGS-Agent通过显式推理流程解决了Ref-AVS任务，性能优越且更具可解释性。

Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects
in audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically
rely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable
SAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level
supervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit
reference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a
Think-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first
identifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by
coarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first
propose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over
textual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset
with explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The
object description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for
Grounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without
relying on pixel-level supervision. Additionally, we introduce
R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench, a new benchmark with linguistically diverse and
reasoning-intensive references for better evaluating model generalization. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard Ref-AVSBench and
proposed R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench. Code will be available at
