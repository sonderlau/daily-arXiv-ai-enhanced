While LAM uses\nlateral boundaries from an external global model, SGM incorporates a global\ndomain at lower resolution. This study aims to understand how the differences\nin model design impact relative performance and potential applications.\nSpecifically, the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches are\nidentified for generating deterministic regional forecasts over Europe. Using\nthe Anemoi framework, models of both types are built by minimally adapting a\nshared architecture and trained using global and regional reanalyses in a\nnear-identical setup. Several inference experiments have been conducted to\nexplore their relative performance and highlight key differences. Results show\nthat both LAM and SGM are competitive deterministic MLWP models with generally\naccurate and comparable forecasting performance over the regional domain.\nVarious differences were identified in the performance of the models across\napplications. LAM is able to successfully exploit high-quality boundary\nforcings to make predictions within the regional domain and is suitable in\ncontexts where global data is difficult to acquire. SGM is fully self-contained\nfor easier operationalisation, can take advantage of more training data and\nsignificantly surpasses LAM in terms of (temporal) generalisability.

By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were\nderived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics\nof the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic\nvelocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also\nperfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature.

First, an encoder\nblock converts the operands from a two's complement to a sign magnitude\nrepresentation, followed by a multiplier module which performs the compute\noperation and outputs the resulting value in the original format. This allows\nto leverage the power-efficiency of the Sign Magnitude encoding for the\nmultiplication. To ensure the computing format is not altered, those two\ncomponents are synthesized and optimized separately. Our method leads to\nsignificant power savings for input values centered around zero, as commonly\nencountered in AI workloads. Under a realistic input stream with values\nnormally distributed with a standard deviation of 3.0, post-synthesis\nsimulations of the 4-bit multiplier design show up to 12.9% lower switching\nactivity compared to synthesis without decomposition.

Yet fundamental\nquestions about stability, memory and expressive power remain fragmented across\ndisciplines. We present a unified, dynamical-systems treatment that weaves\ntogether functional analysis, random attractor theory and recent\nneuroscientific findings. First, on compact multivariate input alphabets we\nprove that the Echo-State Property (wash-out of initial conditions) together\nwith global Lipschitz dynamics necessarily yields the Fading-Memory Property\n(geometric forgetting of remote inputs). Tight algebraic tests translate\nactivation-specific Lipschitz constants into certified spectral-norm bounds,\ncovering both saturating and rectifying nonlinearities. Second, employing a\nStone-Weierstrass strategy we give a streamlined proof that ESNs with\npolynomial reservoirs and linear read-outs are dense in the Banach space of\ncausal, time-invariant fading-memory filters, extending universality to\nstochastic inputs. Third, we quantify computational resources via\nmemory-capacity spectrum, show how topology and leak rate redistribute\ndelay-specific capacities, and link these trade-offs to Lyapunov spectra at the\n\\textit{edge of chaos}. Finally, casting ESNs as skew-product random dynamical\nsystems, we establish existence of singleton pullback attractors and derive\nconditional Lyapunov bounds, providing a rigorous analogue to cortical\ncriticality. The analysis yields concrete design rules-spectral radius, input\ngain, activation choice-grounded simultaneously in mathematics and\nneuroscience, and clarifies why modest-sized reservoirs often rival fully\ntrained recurrent networks in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3001\u968f\u673a\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56de\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ESN\uff09\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3ESN\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3001\u968f\u673a\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u6570\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001Stone-Weierstrass\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76ESN\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ESN\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u6e10\u8fd1\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u6027\u5230\u968f\u673a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aESN\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5c0f\u578bESN\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based\napproach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage\nMedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.\nThese features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the\nbest-fit model from a curated repository.

In this work, we investigated how size and\nseparability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features\nand performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning\nmodels for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging\nDataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on\nimaging manufacturer) or non-separable \"pseudo-subgroups\". We found that\nsimulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature\nrepresentations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature\nspace were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the\nsubgroup affected by label bias.

Our approach stresses the need for an analysis\nof AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and\nmulti-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we\nprovide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In\nparticular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the\ninteraction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,\nincorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments\nabout the contextual promotion or demotion of rights.

Our experiment shows that post-training on the \\textbf{TAV}\ndataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap\nbetween required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTAV\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbAI\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5728\u77ed\u7247\u6bb5\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u4f55\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Transition-Aware Video (TAV)\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528TAV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9700\u6c42\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "TAV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u591a\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that\nautoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language\ninputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including\nVideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information\nfrom prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual\ncross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted\nfrom the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level\nsummaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use\nof sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,\nenabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and\nneural responses.

Consequently, it\nis more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where\nbiologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust\nand objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line\ncomparisons.\n  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess\nthe stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was\napplied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to\nanalyze the difference in this uniformity between \\textit{Demodex}-negative and\n\\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a\nsignificant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,\nwith an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of\n0.93.

While diffusion-based methods\nhave shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.\nHowever, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to\ncapture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to\nstructural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that\njointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light\nimages, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing\ngeneration quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from\nlow-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce\nan adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.\nBy leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes\nan implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise\ndistribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the\nmodels ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation.

Current methods mainly address typical daylight\nconditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light\nenvironments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth\nestimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems\nfrom the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for\nlow-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)\nstrategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust\nfoundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation.

These ice clouds can\nalter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of\naviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail\nformation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality\nof atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex\nprocesses like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.\nObservational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,\ncould be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing\ndatasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they\ntypically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their\nsource flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible\nCamera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded\nwith a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is\nindividually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its\nlifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and\nincludes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera.

Further ablation experiments demonstrated\nthat the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly\nlearn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model\nrepresentation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar\nto the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more\nmachine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u79fb\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u773c\u5e95\u8840\u7ba1\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5377\u79ef\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u8026\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u5b50\u50cf\u7d20\u4f4d\u79fb\u573a\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5f62\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u53d8\u5f62\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u773c\u5e95\u8840\u7ba1\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cGDCUnet\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18\nbenchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction\nmodels. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human\nground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down\napproaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These\nfindings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal\nprobabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications\nfor real-time cognitive computing and robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemBA-FAST\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6982\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u626b\u63cf\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u6574\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u4e2d\u592e\u51f9\u66f4\u65b0\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728COCO-Search18\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSemBA-FAST\u7684\u626b\u63cf\u8def\u5f84\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u771f\u5b9e\u626b\u63cf\u8def\u5f84\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u8bed\u4e49-\u4e2d\u592e\u51f9\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ba4\u77e5\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We release the\ndataset and benchmark to foster further research:\nhttps://graceduansu.github.io/IdentifyingPromptedArtists/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u793a\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b1.95M\u56fe\u50cf\u548c110\u4f4d\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5404\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u660e\u786e\u547d\u540d\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b110\u4f4d\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u76841.95M\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u98ce\u683c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u539f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u98ce\u683c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u5728\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\u660e\u663e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u591a\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u63d0\u793a\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u516c\u5f00\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

Project page: https://thecinema.ai", "summary": "We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.\nGiven a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly\ngenerates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which\nensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,\nscenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.\nThese keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,\nwhich supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics\nbetween them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support\nstable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,\nwe introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion\nTransformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our\nmodel is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of\ninterleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema\nperforms favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative\nconsistent short movies in high quality and efficiency.
