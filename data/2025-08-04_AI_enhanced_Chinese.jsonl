To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with\nthree datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)\nKinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural\nvideo datasets.

Nevertheless, most existing approaches remain dependent on\nhandcrafted heuristics, which limits their generality and automation. To\naddress this challenge, we propose Evolutionary Generative Optimization\n(EvoGO), a fully data-driven framework empowered by generative learning. EvoGO\nstreamlines the evolutionary optimization process into three stages: data\npreparation, model training, and population generation. The data preparation\nstage constructs a pairwise dataset to enrich training diversity without\nincurring additional evaluation costs. During model training, a tailored\ngenerative model learns to transform inferior solutions into superior ones.

We demonstrate, via both\nsimulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform\nseveral baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across\nchallenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and\nlow-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.\n  Our project webpage is at https://bhavyagoyal.github.io/ppc .", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u70b9\u4e91\uff08PPC\uff09\u7684\u65b03D\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70b9\u6dfb\u52a0\u6982\u7387\u5c5e\u6027\u6765\u5c01\u88c5\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u53473D\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3LiDAR\u5728\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u4f4e\u53cd\u5149\u7269\u4f53\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf3D\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u672a\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PPC\uff0c\u4e3a\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70b9\u6dfb\u52a0\u6982\u7387\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8ePPC\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u52303D\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cPPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eLiDAR\u53ca\u76f8\u673a-LiDAR\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5c0f\u3001\u8fdc\u3001\u4f4e\u53cd\u5149\u7269\u4f53\u53ca\u5f3a\u73af\u5883\u5149\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "PPC\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the\narchitecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning\nand computational science. Here we define structured graph \"lineages\" (ordered\nby level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number\nof graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2)\nbipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in\nmultigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using\nprolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures\nbetween graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of \"graded\ngraphs\" can be defined, and using it low-cost \"skeletal\" variants of standard\nalgebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product,\ndisjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence\nhierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar\nbut not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard\ncounterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can\napproach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on\ngraded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of\nmultiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers\n(useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining \"skeletal\"\nfunctions).

Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and\nshape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in\nbiological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the\nlimited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive\nmulti-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an\nextended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a\nunified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key\ninnovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer\n(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture\npartitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)\nand taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and\ncommon anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical\nshortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a\ndiffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces\ntwo large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for\nbirds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for\nbirds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities.

While existing model explanation methods, such as\nattention map and Grad-CAM, offer coarse insights into cross-modal\nrelationships, they cannot precisely quantify the synergistic effects between\nmodalities, and are limited to open-source models with accessible internal\nweights. Here we introduce MultiSHAP, a model-agnostic interpretability\nframework that leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute multimodal\npredictions to pairwise interactions between fine-grained visual and textual\nelements (such as image patches and text tokens), while being applicable to\nboth open- and closed-source models. Our approach provides: (1) instance-level\nexplanations that reveal synergistic and suppressive cross-modal effects for\nindividual samples - \"why the model makes a specific prediction on this input\",\nand (2) dataset-level explanation that uncovers generalizable interaction\npatterns across samples - \"how the model integrates information across\nmodalities\". Experiments on public multimodal benchmarks confirm that MultiSHAP\nfaithfully captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, while real-world case\nstudies demonstrate its practical utility. Our framework is extensible beyond\ntwo modalities, offering a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal\nAI models.", "AI": {"tldr": "MultiSHAP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Shapley\u4ea4\u4e92\u6307\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u201c\u9ed1\u76d2\u201d\u7279\u6027\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "MultiSHAP\u901a\u8fc7Shapley\u4ea4\u4e92\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ea7\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9eMultiSHAP\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MultiSHAP\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e24\u79cd\u4ee5\u4e0a\u6a21\u6001\u3002"}}

While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses\nthis limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time\nlags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal\ninteractions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.\nFor example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region\nwith a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we\nformalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a\nnovel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling\nfrequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC,\ndemonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference\npipeline.

Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures\nand lip movements into text via AI-driven methods.

However, constrained by\nlimited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity\nfor adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal\nperformance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in\nhandling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose\nthe first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It\nintegrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based\nHand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt\nstrategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip\nRecognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand\nPrompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip\nfeatures during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction\nPhoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from\nphoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through\nsemantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS\ndataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a\nmixed dataset of fourteen subjects.

This paper delves into a previously\noverlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly\nconveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.\nCorrespondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the\nbiased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To\naddress this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive\ndecouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the\nvisual modality into the foreground and background representation via\nexploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these\ndecoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the\nhand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal\nalignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual\npull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,\ndirecting the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the\nregion-of-interest object.

To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach\nthat uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional\ninpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints\nfrom human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions:\nthe primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the\nsecondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional\ninpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions\nwithin a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the\ngenerated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental\nresults show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in\nHOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like\nunderstanding of dynamic environments.

While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,\nthey primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and\nclinical information routinely used by radiologists.

Mamba, as an emerging state space model with\ninherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable\nfor processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,\ndue to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in\napplying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot\nmaintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of\nseverely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the\nhidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the\nunderstanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first\nMamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two\ninnovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to\nmigrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of\nthe internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to\ndynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and\nproviding dynamic local receptive fields.

Our\nanalysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly\napply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples,\ndemonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path\nto improve model resilience in real-world scenarios.

However, these methods struggle when dynamic\nobjects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose\nestimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a\ncommonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects\nand occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional\nuncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the\nuncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty\nmust be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify\nunreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end\napproach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame\nuncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation.

Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and\nnuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous\nunsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong\nperformance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail.\nAdditionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of\ncross-frame uncertainty propagation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8de8\u5e27\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5CoProU-VO\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoProU-VO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u7ed3\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u5e27\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5355\u76ee\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u5e27\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by\nextreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth\ndiscontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous\nmotion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and\nfail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion\nfields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We\nobserve that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion\nsub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion\npatterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in\ntwo-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first\ndevise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier\nprobability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion\nfield into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.\nNext, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each\nsub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a\ncustomized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous\nmotion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational\nentanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this\nminimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in\nrelative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization.

Project page:\n  https://gwxuan.github.io/IGL-Nav/", "summary": "Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging\nproblem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or\nmodular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot\nfully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and\nthe goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image\nin 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian\n(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS\noptimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly\nleveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is\nprohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D\nGaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal\nnavigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as\nnew images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely\nlocalize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space\nmatching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent\nis close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization\nvia differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental\nconfigurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal\nsetting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to\ncapture goal image at arbitrary pose.
