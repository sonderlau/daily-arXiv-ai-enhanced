### [1] [Reflecting on a Decade of Formalized Tornado Emergencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25011)
*Edward C. Wolff,James S. Goodnight,Leanne Blind-Doskocil,Elijah M. Conklin,Evan T. Gustafson,Joseph E. Trujillo-Falcón*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 分析了2014-2023年89次龙卷风紧急警报的有效性，发现预报员大多未遵循建议标准，但70%的警报针对EF-3+级龙卷风，覆盖了55%的EF-4级龙卷风和41%造成3人以上死亡的龙卷风。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究龙卷风紧急警报系统的有效性，因为自2014年正式引入以来，缺乏对该警报类型具体效果的系统性研究。

Method: 分析2014-2023年间发布的89次基于影响的龙卷风紧急警报数据，评估预报员是否遵循建议的旋转速度(VROT)和显著龙卷风参数(STP)标准。

Result: 只有2次龙卷风紧急警报同时满足VROT和STP阈值，但70%的警报针对EF-3+级龙卷风，覆盖了55%的EF-4级龙卷风和41%造成3人以上死亡的龙卷风。

Conclusion: 尽管预报员未严格遵循建议标准，但龙卷风紧急警报在识别最危险龙卷风方面表现良好，建议更新国家气象局的培训材料。

Abstract: In 1999 the NWS began using the phrase "tornado emergency" to denote tornado
warnings for storms with the potential to cause rare, catastrophic damage.
After years of informal usage, tornado emergencies were formally introduced to
46 weather forecasting offices in 2014 as part of the impact-based warning
(IBW) program, with a nationwide rollout occurring over the following years. In
concert with the new tiered warning approach, the Warning Decision Training
Division (WDTD) also introduced suggested criteria for when forecasters should
consider upgrading a tornado warning to a tornado emergency, which includes
thresholds of rotational velocity (VROT) and significant tornado parameter
(STP). Although significant research has studied both tornado forecasting and
tornado warning dissemination in the decade since, relatively little work has
examined the effectiveness of the tornado emergency specifically. Our analysis
of all 89 IBW tornado emergencies issued from 2014-2023 found that forecasters
do not appear to follow suggested criteria for issuance in the majority of
cases, with only two tornado emergencies meeting both VROT and STP thresholds.
Regardless, 70% of tornado emergencies were issued for EF-3+ tornadoes and
tornado emergencies covered 55% of all EF-4 tornadoes as well as 41% of all
tornadoes resulting in 3 or more fatalities. Based on these results, we propose
several updates to the current NWS training materials for impact-based tornado
warnings.

### [2] [Evaluating Extreme Precipitation Forecasts: A Threshold-Weighted, Spatial Verification Approach for Comparing an AI Weather Prediction Model Against a High-Resolution NWP Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25045)
*Nicholas Loveday,Tracy Hertneky*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合空间验证方法和适当评分规则的极端天气事件预测评估框架，用于比较AI天气预测模型与传统高分辨率NWP模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI天气预测模型在计算成本大幅降低的情况下具有与传统NWP模型相当的预报能力，但需要适当的评估方法来检验其对极端天气事件的预测能力，特别是在空间一致性重要且网格分辨率不同的情况下。

Method: 将高分辨率评估方法与阈值加权评分规则相结合，支持用户导向的评估，允许灵活加权不同决策阈值的相对重要性。

Result: 模型排名对邻域大小选择敏感；增加邻域大小对高分辨率NWP模型的极端事件性能评分影响更大；在相同邻域大小下，高分辨率NWP模型仅在短预报时效上优于AIWP模型；NWP模型在短时效具有更好的判别能力，而AIWP模型从24小时时效开始略优。

Conclusion: 该框架为极端天气事件预测提供了有效的评估方法，揭示了不同模型在不同预报时效和评估条件下的相对优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather prediction have led to the development of
artificial intelligence weather prediction (AIWP) models with competitive
forecast skill compared to traditional NWP models, but with substantially
reduced computational cost. There is a strong need for appropriate methods to
evaluate their ability to predict extreme weather events, particularly when
spatial coherence is important, and grid resolutions differ between models.
  We introduce a verification framework that combines spatial verification
methods and proper scoring rules. Specifically, the framework extends the
High-Resolution Assessment (HiRA) approach with threshold-weighted scoring
rules. It enables user-oriented evaluation consistent with how forecasts may be
interpreted by operational meteorologists or used in simple post-processing
systems. The method supports targeted evaluation of extreme events by allowing
flexible weighting of the relative importance of different decision thresholds.
We demonstrate this framework by evaluating 32 months of precipitation
forecasts from an AIWP model and a high-resolution NWP model. Our results show
that model rankings are sensitive to the choice of neighbourhood size.
Increasing the neighbourhood size has a greater impact on scores evaluating
extreme-event performance for the high-resolution NWP model than for the AIWP
model. At equivalent neighbourhood sizes, the high-resolution NWP model only
outperformed the AIWP model in predicting extreme precipitation events at short
lead times. We also demonstrate how this approach can be extended to evaluate
discrimination ability in predicting heavy precipitation. We find that the
high-resolution NWP model had superior discrimination ability at short lead
times, while the AIWP model had slightly better discrimination ability from a
lead time of 24-hours onwards.

### [3] [The representation of Convectively Coupled Equatorial Waves and upscale energy transfer in models with explicit and parametrized convection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25444)
*E. McKinnon-Gray,D. Shipley,J. Methven,T. H. A. Frame,C. Sanchez,A. McCabe,N. M. Roberts*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 本研究比较了两种热带通道模拟中CCEWs的表现及其与能量向上尺度传输的关系，发现显式表示对流运动的RAL模拟比参数化对流的GAL模拟具有更高的向上尺度能量传输和更一致的CCEWs结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CCEWs及其与向上尺度能量传输的关系对于准确模拟和预测热带天气系统至关重要，特别是比较参数化对流与显式对流表示对模拟结果的影响。

Method: 使用两种Met Office统一模型模拟（GAL参数化对流，RAL显式对流），在相同公里尺度分辨率下诊断CCEWs和尺度间能量传输。

Result: RAL模拟的平均向上尺度传输比GAL高50%，CCEWs更一致，相速变异性更接近观测值。在波内向上尺度能量传输更强，与赤道波风的关联性更强。

Conclusion: 显式表示对流运动对向上尺度能量传输模拟有显著影响，是准确模拟CCEWs中对流耦合的重要因素。

Abstract: Convectively Coupled Equatorial Waves (CCEWs) dominate atmospheric
variability on timescales of 2--30 days in the Tropics, bringing episodes of
widespread heavy precipitation. This study compares the representation of CCEWs
and their connection to upscale energy transfer in two Met Office Unified Model
simulations of the full tropical channel with identical km-scale resolution.
The principal difference between the simulations is that one parametrizes
convection (GAL), while the other (RAL) is convection permitting. This means
GAL acts to remove vertical instability without explicitly representing the
resolved-scale circulation associated with convective plumes. We present the
first quantitative diagnosis of interscale energy transfer and its relation to
CCEWs. This diagnosis is important because upscale energy transfer between
convection and large-scale waves may influence accurate simulation and
predictability of tropical weather systems. The average upper-tropospheric
upscale transfer simulated by RAL is approximately 50\% higher than GAL. CCEWs
are more coherent in RAL, with an average phase-speed variability 80\% higher
than observations, compared with 166\% higher in GAL. RAL also simulates
greater upscale energy transfer within waves than GAL, with a stronger
correlation between the interscale energy transfer rate and equatorial wave
winds. Simulated Kelvin and Rossby waves are associated with upscale energy
transfer from scales 2--8 times smaller than the dominant wavelength, related
to active deep convection within a particular sector of the wave phase. Our
findings show that the explicit representation of convective motions has a
significant impact on the simulation of upscale energy transfer, and is
therefore very likely to be a significant factor in the faithful simulation of
the convective coupling within CCEWs.

### [4] [Diagnostic vs dynamic representation of the inverse barometer effect in a global ocean model and its potential for probabilistic storm surge forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25481)
*Nils Melsom Kristensen,Kristian Mogensen,Sarah-Jane Lock,Øyvind Breivik*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 研究表明，在NEMO全球海洋模型中包含逆气压计效应可以改善中期风暴潮预报，平均降低约1厘米的均方根误差，在强风暴潮事件中可降低4-5厘米误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估包含逆气压计效应对全球中期风暴潮预报的改进潜力，特别是比较动态压力强迫与诊断性添加逆气压计效应两种方法的性能差异。

Method: 使用NEMO全球海洋模型进行独立配置实验（2015-2022），包括控制实验（无逆气压计效应）、动态压力强迫实验和诊断性添加逆气压计效应实验，并与GESLA3全球水位数据集进行对比验证。

Result: 包含逆气压计效应平均降低约1厘米均方根误差，在强风暴潮事件中（超过±1或±2标准差）可降低4-5厘米误差。动态压力强迫在封闭海区（如波罗的海）表现略优于诊断性方法。

Conclusion: 包含逆气压计效应能显著改善风暴潮预报精度，特别是在强风暴潮事件中。动态压力强迫方法在特定区域表现更好，而诊断性方法在集合预报中能提供更早的极端水位预警信号。

Abstract: The global ocean model NEMO is run in a series of stand-alone configurations
(2015-2022) to investigate the potential for improving global medium-range
storm surge forecasts by including the inverse barometer effect. Here, we
compare a control experiment, where the inverse barometer effect was not
included, against a run dynamically forced with mean sea level pressure. In the
control experiment, the inverse barometer effect was then calculated
diagnostically and added to the ocean model sea surface elevation, resulting in
a total of three experiments to investigate. We compare against the global
GESLA3 water level data set and find that the inclusion of the inverse
barometer effect reduces the root-mean-square error by $\sim 1~cm$ on average.
When we mask out all data where the observed storm surge is less than $\pm1$ or
$\pm2$ standard deviations, including the inverse barometer effect reduces the
RMS error by $4-5$ cm. While both methods reduce water level errors, there are
regional differences in their performance. The run with dynamical pressure
forcing is seen to perform slightly better than diagnostically adding the
inverse barometer effect in enclosed basins such as the Baltic Sea. Finally, an
ensemble forecast experiment with the Integrated Forecast System of the
European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts demonstrates that when the
diagnostic inverse barometer effect is included for a severe storm surge event
in the North Sea (Storm Xaver, December 2013), the ensemble spread of water
level provides a stronger and earlier indication of the observed maximum surge
level than the when the effect is excluded.

### [5] [Predictability of Storms in an Idealized Climate Revealed by Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25633)
*Wuqiushi Yao,Or Hadas,Yohai Kaspi*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 使用CNN预测和量化20万多个风暴的强度增长和轨迹不确定性，发现在理想化气候背景下，风暴强度比轨迹更难预测，强斜压性和增强的急流蜿蜒会降低可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中纬度气候和天气由风暴塑造，但控制其可预测性的因素仍不够清楚，需要研究风暴可预测性的机制。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络(CNN)预测200年水行星GCM中模拟的20万多个风暴的强度增长和轨迹，并量化不确定性，采用可解释AI生成敏感性图谱。

Result: 风暴强度比轨迹更难预测；强斜压性加速风暴增强并降低可预测性；增强的急流蜿蜒进一步降低预报技巧，误差增长率几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: 机器学习在推进对可预测性及其控制机制的理解方面具有潜力，揭示了天气尺度的不确定性来源。

Abstract: The midlatitude climate and weather are shaped by storms, yet the factors
governing their predictability remain insufficiently understood. Here, we use a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict and quantify uncertainty in the
intensity growth and trajectory of over 200,000 storms simulated in a 200-year
aquaplanet GCM. This idealized framework provides a controlled climate
background for isolating factors that govern predictability. Results show that
storm intensity is less predictable than trajectory. Strong baroclinicity
accelerates storm intensification and reduces its predictability, consistent
with theory. Crucially, enhanced jet meanders further degrade forecast skill,
revealing a synoptic source of uncertainty. Using sensitivity maps from
explainable AI, we find that the error growth rate is nearly doubled by the
more meandering structure. These findings highlight the potential of machine
learning for advancing understanding of predictability and its governing
mechanisms.

### [6] [Exponential Dynamic Energy Network for High Capacity Sequence Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24965)
*Arjun Karuvally,Pichsinee Lertsaroj,Terrence J. Sejnowski,Hava T. Siegelmann*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: EDEN是一种新型神经网络架构，通过在多时间尺度上演化能量函数，将能量范式扩展到时序领域，实现了指数级序列记忆容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Hopfield网络等能量模型适用于静态联想记忆，但无法有效建模需要记忆间转换的序列记忆。

Method: 结合静态高容量能量网络与缓慢、非对称交互的调节种群，通过推导短时间尺度的能量函数来解析计算记忆逃逸时间。

Result: EDEN实现了指数级序列记忆容量O(γ^N)，优于传统模型的线性容量O(N)，其动态特性与人类大脑在情景记忆任务中观察到的时间细胞和斜坡细胞活动相似。

Conclusion: EDEN通过动态能量框架统一静态和序列记忆，为人工和生物系统提供了可扩展且可解释的高容量时序记忆模型。

Abstract: The energy paradigm, exemplified by Hopfield networks, offers a principled
framework for memory in neural systems by interpreting dynamics as descent on
an energy surface. While powerful for static associative memories, it falls
short in modeling sequential memory, where transitions between memories are
essential. We introduce the Exponential Dynamic Energy Network (EDEN), a novel
architecture that extends the energy paradigm to temporal domains by evolving
the energy function over multiple timescales. EDEN combines a static
high-capacity energy network with a slow, asymmetrically interacting modulatory
population, enabling robust and controlled memory transitions. We formally
derive short-timescale energy functions that govern local dynamics and use them
to analytically compute memory escape times, revealing a phase transition
between static and dynamic regimes. The analysis of capacity, defined as the
number of memories that can be stored with minimal error rate as a function of
the dimensions of the state space (number of feature neurons), for EDEN shows
that it achieves exponential sequence memory capacity $O(\gamma^N)$,
outperforming the linear capacity $O(N)$ of conventional models. Furthermore,
EDEN's dynamics resemble the activity of time and ramping cells observed in the
human brain during episodic memory tasks, grounding its biological relevance.
By unifying static and sequential memory within a dynamic energy framework,
EDEN offers a scalable and interpretable model for high-capacity temporal
memory in both artificial and biological systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于熵产生物理和对称约束的高性能、高能效模拟计算系统框架，通过最大熵原理实现相关性和内积计算，并在22nm SOI CMOS工艺中验证了超过2 PetaOPS/W的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用熵产生物理与对称约束相结合，实现高性能和能量效率的模拟计算系统，特别是在边缘计算场景中处理射频数据。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了通过物理原理和对称约束实现极高能效模拟计算的可行性，并在实际射频应用中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how the physics of entropy production, when
combined with symmetry constraints, can be used for implementing
high-performance and energy-efficient analog computing systems. At the core of
the proposed framework is a generalized maximum-entropy principle that can
describe the evolution of a mesoscopic physical system formed by an
interconnected ensemble of analog elements, including devices that can be
readily fabricated on standard integrated circuit technology. We show that the
maximum-entropy state of this ensemble corresponds to a margin-propagation (MP)
distribution and can be used for computing correlations and inner products as
the ensemble's macroscopic properties. Furthermore, the limits of computational
throughput and energy efficiency can be pushed by extending the framework to
non-equilibrium or transient operating conditions, which we demonstrate using a
proof-of-concept radio-frequency (RF) correlator integrated circuit fabricated
in a 22 nm SOI CMOS process. The measured results show a compute efficiency
greater than 2 Peta ($10^{15}$) Bit Operations per second per Watt (PetaOPS/W)
at 8-bit precision and greater than 0.8 Exa ($10^{18}$) Bit Operations per
second per Watt (ExaOPS/W) at 3-bit precision for RF data sampled at rates
greater than 4 GS/s. Using the fabricated prototypes, we also showcase several
real-world RF applications at the edge, including spectrum sensing, and
code-domain communications.

Conclusion: 信任和声誉机制为进化优化提供了灵活自适应的新途径，在多数情况下能提高解的质量。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Trust-Based Optimization (TBO), a novel extension
of the island model in evolutionary computation that replaces conventional
periodic migrations with a flexible, agent-driven interaction mechanism based
on trust or reputation. Experimental results demonstrate that TBO generally
outperforms the standard island model evolutionary algorithm across various
optimization problems. Nevertheless, algorithm performance varies depending on
the problem type, with certain configurations being more effective for specific
landscapes or dimensions. The findings suggest that trust and reputation
mechanisms provide a flexible and adaptive approach to evolutionary
optimization, improving solution quality in many cases.

Abstract: Synthetic Benchmark Problems (SBPs) are commonly used to evaluate the
performance of metaheuristic algorithms. However, these SBPs often contain
various unrealistic properties, potentially leading to underestimation or
overestimation of algorithmic performance. While several benchmark suites
comprising real-world problems have been proposed for various types of
metaheuristics, a notable gap exists for Constrained Multi-objective
Optimization Problems (CMOPs) derived from practical engineering applications,
particularly in the domain of Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) design.
To address this gap, this study develops and presents a specialized benchmark
suite for multi-objective optimization in BTMS. This suite comprises a diverse
collection of real-world constrained problems, each defined via accurate
surrogate models based on recent research to efficiently represent complex
thermal-fluid interactions. The primary goal of this benchmark suite is to
provide a practical and relevant testing ground for evolutionary algorithms and
optimization methods focused on energy storage thermal management. Future work
will involve establishing comprehensive baseline results using state-of-the-art
algorithms, conducting comparative analyses, and developing a standardized
ranking scheme to facilitate robust performance assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene是一个在线前馈框架，仅使用两个连续环视图像就能重建4D动态驾驶场景，通过轻量级残差流网络预测动态物体的非刚性运动，在nuScenes数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Motivation: 实时高保真重建动态驾驶场景面临复杂动态和稀疏视图的挑战，现有方法难以平衡质量和效率。

Method: 提出轻量级残差流网络，在学习的静态场景先验基础上预测动态物体的非刚性运动，通过场景流显式建模动态，并采用粗到精的训练范式避免端到端方法的不稳定性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，该仅使用图像的方法能在线生成高质量深度、场景流和3D高斯点云，在动态重建和新视角合成方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DrivingScene框架成功解决了动态驾驶场景重建中质量与效率的平衡问题，为实时4D场景重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频描述方法难以捕捉细粒度运动细节，导致描述模糊或语义不一致，需要改进对复杂人体运动的准确描述能力。

Method: M-ACM框架结合运动感知解码，利用人体网格恢复提取运动表示，通过运动增强机制提升描述生成质量。

Conclusion: M-ACM通过运动感知解码有效提升了视频描述的质量，特别是在捕捉人体动态方面表现出色，为运动中心视频描述任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

Motivation: 解决SAR图像自动目标识别中真实标注数据缺乏的问题，通过合成数据训练模型，但需要克服模拟数据与真实数据之间的域差距。

Method: 结合基于散射中心模型的MOCEM模拟器和基于光线追踪的Salsa模拟器生成多样化合成数据集，使用ADASCA深度学习方法进行训练。

Result: 在MSTAR真实测量数据上达到了接近88%的识别准确率。

Conclusion: 通过结合不同物理模型的模拟器可以生成更全面的合成数据集，有效提升自动目标识别模型在真实数据上的泛化能力。

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的移动激光扫描点云不确定性评估框架，使用随机森林和XGBoost模型学习局部几何特征与点级误差的关系，实现无需高精度参考数据的大规模不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆向不确定性建模依赖高精度参考数据，成本高且难以大规模应用，需要开发不依赖参考数据的点云不确定性评估方法。

Method: 使用随机森林和XGBoost集成学习模型，基于局部几何特征预测点级不确定性，采用空间分区数据集避免数据泄露。

Result: 两种模型均能有效捕捉几何特征与不确定性的非线性关系，平均ROC-AUC值超过0.87，高程变化、点密度和局部结构复杂性是最重要的预测特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模点云质量控制和误差分析提供了可扩展的数据驱动解决方案，无需高精度参考数据即可可靠评估不确定性。

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态交叉增强融合框架，通过眼动追踪和面部特征的协同整合来辅助阿尔茨海默病诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的准确诊断对于及时干预至关重要，而眼动追踪和面部特征作为认知功能的重要指标，目前很少有研究探索它们的联合整合用于辅助诊断。

Method: 提出了多模态交叉增强融合框架，包含两个关键模块：交叉增强融合注意力模块（CEFAM）通过交叉注意力和全局增强建模模态间交互；方向感知卷积模块（DACM）通过水平-垂直感受野捕获细粒度方向性面部特征。

Result: 在包含25名AD患者和25名健康对照的同步多模态数据集上，该框架实现了95.11%的分类准确率，优于传统的后期融合和特征拼接方法。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模模态间依赖关系和模态特定贡献，该框架在阿尔茨海默病诊断中表现出卓越的鲁棒性和诊断性能。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads

units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ESCA框架，通过后训练量化和定制硬件加速器，在资源受限的VR设备上实现高保真Codec Avatar模型的实时推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Photorealistic Codec Avatar模型在VR设备上计算需求大、实时推理困难的问题，特别是在头戴式显示器等资源受限设备上。

Method: 1. 为Codec Avatar模型定制高效的后训练量化方法；2. 设计可集成到VR设备SoC中的定制硬件加速器；3. 构建完整的ESCA全栈优化框架。

Result: ESCA将FovVideoVDP质量评分提升+0.39（相比最佳4位基线），延迟降低3.36倍，在端到端测试中维持100帧/秒的渲染速率，满足实时VR需求。

Conclusion: 证明了在资源受限设备上部署高保真Codec Avatar的可行性，为更沉浸式和便携的VR体验打开了大门。

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文发现视觉模型在图结构理解方面具有与GNN相当的性能，但在全局结构感知方面表现更优，特别是在需要整体拓扑认知的任务上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉模型在图理解中的潜力，因为GNN采用自下而上的消息传递机制，与人类视觉感知（先捕获全局结构）存在根本差异。

Method: 引入GraphAbstract基准测试，评估模型感知全局图属性的能力，包括识别组织原型、检测对称性、感知连接强度和识别关键元素。

Result: 视觉模型在需要整体结构理解的任务上显著优于GNN，且在不同图规模下保持泛化能力，而GNN在全局模式抽象方面表现不佳且随图规模增大性能下降。

Conclusion: 视觉模型在图结构理解方面具有显著但未被充分利用的能力，特别是在需要全局拓扑意识和尺度不变推理的问题上，这为开发更有效的图基础模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理图像多视图数据时面临图结构不明确和视图融合困难的挑战，限制了半监督学习的效率。

Method: 结合线性特征变换和多视图图融合的GCN框架，动态集成伪标签到损失函数，校正类边界样本权重，并引入无监督平滑损失。

Result: 在多视图基准图像数据集上的实验表明，RSGSLM超越了现有的半监督学习方法。

Conclusion: RSGSLM通过创新的图结构和伪标签集成方法，有效提升了多视图数据半监督学习的性能，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

TL;DR: PISA-Bench是一个多语言视觉语言基准测试，基于PISA考试构建，包含6种语言的平行语料，用于评估多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏高质量人工验证样本，多依赖LLM生成内容且主要限于英语，需要填补多语言高质量基准的空白。

Method: 从PISA考试中提取人工创建的指令、问题、选项和图像，翻译成5种语言，构建包含6种语言的完全平行语料库。

Result: 评估发现小模型(<20B参数)表现不佳，非英语分割性能显著下降，空间和几何推理错误率高。

Conclusion: PISA-Bench为多语言多模态推理研究提供了有价值的资源，揭示了当前模型在跨语言和复杂推理任务上的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

TL;DR: 研究发现13个视觉语言模型中有12个表现出与人类冲突适应一致的行为，通过稀疏自编码器识别出任务相关的超节点，并发现与人类阅读和颜色命名自动性不对称相似的神经表征模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人工智能模型是否能够展现类似人类认知控制中的冲突适应现象，以理解认知控制这一稀缺资源如何被调用。

Method: 使用顺序Stroop任务测试视觉语言模型，采用稀疏自编码器识别任务相关超节点，并通过消融实验验证关键节点功能。

Result: 12个VLMs表现出冲突适应行为，识别出文本和颜色的部分重叠超节点，发现第24-25层存在冲突调节超节点，其消融显著增加Stroop错误。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型能够模拟人类认知控制中的冲突适应现象，其内部表征结构与人类认知处理的自动性不对称具有相似性。

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级检索增强图像描述模型仅将检索数据用作文本提示，导致原始视觉特征未得到增强，特别是对于对象细节或复杂场景存在语义鸿沟

Method: 提出DualCap方法，采用双重检索机制：标准图像到文本检索用于文本提示，新颖的图像到图像检索用于获取视觉相似场景。从视觉相似场景的标题中提取关键词语和短语，通过轻量级可训练特征融合网络将文本特征与原始图像特征集成

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在需要较少可训练参数的情况下实现了竞争性性能

Conclusion: DualCap通过视觉提示增强视觉表示，有效解决了现有方法在对象细节和复杂场景描述中的语义鸿沟问题

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、耗时和不一致问题，现有深度学习方法在准确性和特征透明度方面仍有挑战。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 微调5种先进视觉架构；2) 提取多级深度特征训练7种传统机器学习分类器；3) 使用LGBM、随机森林和Lasso进行特征选择。

Result: 在FFE数据集上，Swin-Tiny特征+Extra Trees分类器+LGBM特征选择的最佳配置达到85.99%准确率，比现有方法提升8.69-22.78%。

Conclusion: 该框架在视觉质量评估任务中具有有效性和泛化能力，为鱼类新鲜度评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: 该基准为MLLMs在视频假新闻检测领域的未来评估和发展奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

Conclusion: 多轮安全编辑框架为文本到图像模型提供了一种模型无关、即插即用的安全对齐解决方案，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Conclusion: 提出的MCIHN模型能有效解决多模态情感识别中的模态差异问题，提升情感识别准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型取得了显著成功，但其生成过程质量的影响因素仍不清楚。本文旨在通过去噪视角来实证探究生成过程。

Method: 建立流匹配模型与去噪器的形式联系，设计原则性扰动（噪声和漂移）来影响样本生成，分析生成过程的不同动态阶段。

Result: 能够精确描述去噪器在生成过程的哪个阶段成功或失败，揭示了不同阶段的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过去噪视角为流匹配生成过程提供了新的理解，能够精确表征生成过程中的关键阶段和去噪器的表现。

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的水果成熟度估计方法，将成熟度估计从离散分类问题重新定义为连续概率学习任务，通过为RT-DETRv2检测器添加概率头部来预测连续成熟度分布和不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法将成熟度作为离散分类问题处理，这与生物成熟过程的连续性本质相冲突，导致信息丢失和类别边界模糊。

Method: 对最先进的实时目标检测器RT-DETRv2进行架构修改，引入专用的概率头部，使模型能够为每个检测对象预测成熟度谱上的连续分布，同时学习平均成熟状态及其相关不确定性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的大规模水果数据集上达到85.6%的平均精度(mAP)，同时提供比基于分类方法更细粒度和准确的成熟度评估。

Conclusion: 概率方法为现代农业提供了更智能、不确定性感知的自动化系统，能够提供更丰富和生物学上更合理的植物成熟度表示。

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于骨架的手语识别方法使用OpenPose提取关键点时处理速度慢的问题，同时避免直接替换为轻量级MediaPipe导致的准确性下降。

Method: 探索关键点子集选择策略优化识别性能，结合样条插值技术处理缺失关键点问题。

Result: 适当的关键点子集实现了与最先进方法相当或更优的性能，处理时间相比Alves等人(2024)的方法减少5倍以上，样条插值显著提升了准确性。

Conclusion: 精心选择关键点结合简单插值技术可实现高效准确的手语识别，为可扩展的手语识别系统铺平道路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

<details>

Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型难以泛化到非常规相机运动，因为缺乏包含这些运动的训练视频，这限制了创造真正原创和艺术性视频的能力。

Method: 提出VividCam训练范式，使用合成视频（如Unity渲染的低多边形3D场景）训练扩散模型，并采用多重解耦策略将相机运动学习与合成外观伪影分离。

Result: 该方法能够合成各种精确控制和复杂的相机运动，仅使用简单的合成数据（基本几何体在低多边形3D场景中）即可实现。

Conclusion: VividCam通过合成视频有效解决了非常规相机运动学习的训练数据稀缺问题，为创造艺术性视频提供了新途径。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图transformer在3D视觉任务中表现出色，但其内部机制不透明，这限制了模型的进一步改进和在安全关键应用中的使用。

Method: 通过探测多视图transformer各层残差连接来分析和可视化3D表示，研究了DUSt3R变体模型在不同层中潜在状态的发展过程。

Result: 揭示了DUSt3R模型在各层中潜在状态的发展模式，发现其对应点估计会随着重建几何的细化而改进，与具有显式全局姿态归纳偏置的方法有所不同。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解多视图transformer的内部工作机制提供了新视角，有助于改进模型设计和在可靠性要求高的应用中使用。

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了M-SAM框架，通过识别主导模态、分解损失景观和更新权重来解决多模态学习中主导模态压制其他模态的问题，提升模型鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，主导模态往往会压制其他模态，限制了模型的泛化能力。需要一种方法来平衡各模态的贡献，增强整体性能。

Method: M-SAM框架包含三个步骤：1) 使用Shapley值识别主导模态；2) 分解损失景观，调整损失函数以优先考虑主导模态的鲁棒性；3) 通过反向传播调制梯度来更新权重。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上的实验表明，M-SAM优于最新的优化和梯度操作方法，显著平衡和改进了多模态学习性能。

Conclusion: M-SAM是一个模型无关的框架，能够有效处理多模态学习中的主导模态问题，增强模型鲁棒性并提升整体性能。

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Motivation: Wi-Fi感知因其低成本、非侵入式获取环境数据的潜力而受到关注，但该领域普遍存在过拟合问题，模型在训练数据上表现良好但难以泛化到新数据。

Method: 引入新颖的混合架构IBIS，集成Inception-BiLSTM和支持向量机(SVM)，旨在提高模型泛化能力并创建更鲁棒的分类边界。

Result: 在多普勒数据上应用该方法，实现了接近99%的运动识别准确率，综合性能指标和混淆矩阵证实了该方案的有效性。

Conclusion: IBIS方法显著提升了Wi-Fi感知模型的泛化性能，为解决过拟合问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Conclusion: 建立了一种新的临床可行VLM-based CAD系统范式，通过有效融合机制充分利用影像数据和上下文患者信息。

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDRP是一个用于零样本人-物交互检测的框架，通过视觉多样性感知和区域感知的提示学习，解决了同类视觉多样性和异类视觉纠缠问题，在HICO-DET基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP等预训练视觉语言模型的方法在处理交互的视觉复杂性方面存在不足，包括同类视觉多样性（同一动词在不同姿态和上下文中的视觉表现差异）和异类视觉纠缠（不同动词产生相似视觉模式）。

Method: 提出视觉多样性和区域感知提示学习框架：1）视觉多样性感知提示学习策略，通过注入分组视觉方差到上下文嵌入中，并应用高斯扰动来捕捉动词的多样化视觉变化；2）从人、物和联合区域检索区域特定概念，用于增强多样性感知提示嵌入，产生区域感知提示以增强动词级区分能力。

Result: 在HICO-DET基准测试的四种零样本评估设置下均取得了最先进的性能，有效解决了同类多样性和异类视觉纠缠问题。

Conclusion: VDRP框架通过结合视觉多样性感知和区域感知的提示学习，显著提升了零样本人-物交互检测的性能，为处理复杂视觉交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-CAM是一种新的类激活映射方法，通过提取语义信息图和语义信息传播，解决了传统CAM方法只突出最具判别性区域的问题，能生成更完整覆盖对象且边界更精确的激活图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法只突出目标的最具判别性区域，无法覆盖整个对象且边界对齐不佳，限制了弱监督语义分割等下游任务的性能。

Method: 通过提取语义信息图(SIMs)和执行语义信息传播(SIP)，同时考虑基线分类模型各阶段的梯度和特征来生成激活图。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC数据集上比原始CAM提升13.61%和13.13%的mIoU，在MS COCO上提升16.23%，在ILSVRC2012上Top-1定位准确率达到51.7%，比LayerCAM高4.5%。

Conclusion: Region-CAM能生成更完整对象覆盖和更精确边界的激活图，显著提升了弱监督学习任务的性能。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene
understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Conclusion: ECAC通过动态调整分类器参数，有效解决了语义分割中的类别分布差异和类别不平衡问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

then channeled into the residual network to extract intricate features at a

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising

Conclusion: RegionE框架无需额外训练即可显著加速基于指令的图像编辑任务，同时保持编辑质量，为IIE任务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

Motivation: 传统方法需要大量带噪声-干净点云对进行训练，人工成本高。本文旨在开发无需干净数据监督的点云去噪方法。

Method: 使用神经网络推断多步去噪路径，通过Noise2Noise匹配方案和新型损失函数实现统计推理，并引入几何一致性约束学习一致性感知去噪模式。

Conclusion: U-CAN框架有效解决了点云去噪中的监督依赖问题，提出的几何一致性约束具有跨领域通用性。

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Conclusion: MSF-Net通过多阶段特征提取和特征融合，有效解决了复杂区域特征冗余问题，实现了更准确的表面法线估计。

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

Conclusion: 该方法能产生更直的路径，避免reflow过程中生成图像的饱和问题，在保持真实图像分布的同时实现更稳健的ODE学习。

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

TL;DR: LangHOPS是首个基于多模态大语言模型的开放词汇对象-部件实例分割框架，能够在语言空间中建立对象-部件层次结构，实现联合检测和分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖启发式或可学习的视觉分组，而LangHOPS利用MLLM的丰富知识和推理能力，在语言空间中建立对象-部件层次结构。

Method: 将MLLM集成到对象-部件解析流程中，利用其多粒度概念链接能力，采用语言驱动的层次结构和部件查询优化策略。

Result: 在PartImageNet数据集上，域内性能提升5.5% AP，跨数据集提升4.8% AP；在ADE20K的零样本分割中，未见对象部件的mIOU提升2.5%。

Conclusion: LangHOPS通过语言驱动的层次结构和MLLM驱动的部件查询优化，在开放词汇对象-部件实例分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The
code will be released here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有无源域自适应方法在域差异较大时的局限性：非生成方法在伪标签不可靠，生成方法在创建伪源数据时域差异扩大。

Method: 将目标样本分为可信集和非可信集，对非可信集样本使用潜在扩散模型进行语义转换，同时保持目标分布，并通过渐进式精炼机制迭代减少伪目标域与真实目标域之间的差异。

Result: 在四个主流SFDA基准数据集上大幅超越现有方法，在源-目标域差异较大场景下性能提升高达18.6%。

Conclusion: DPTM通过扩散驱动的渐进式目标操纵有效解决了源-目标域差异问题，为无源域自适应提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

*Yang Jin,Guangyu Guo,Binglu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaTector+是一个统一框架，用于视线目标检测和视线跟随，消除了推理过程中对头部相关先验知识的依赖，通过共享主干网络和特定模块来优化两个子任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常分开解决视线目标检测和视线跟随任务，且都依赖头部相关先验知识，需要辅助网络提取头部位置，无法进行联合优化，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用扩展的特定-通用-特定特征提取器，共享主干网络提取通用特征，前后使用特定模块处理子任务特性；嵌入头部检测分支预测头部位置；提出基于头部的注意力机制融合感知特征和视线特征；引入注意力监督机制加速视线热图学习；提出新的评估指标mSoC。

Conclusion: GaTector+通过消除对头部先验知识的依赖，实现了视线目标检测和视线跟随的统一优化框架，提高了实际应用能力。

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种仿生单中心成像（BMI）框架，通过仿生全球面单中心镜头和联合重建网络，从单次编码捕获中同时恢复全焦图像和精确深度图，解决了紧凑RGBD成像的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统紧凑光学系统难以在整个景深范围内保持RGB清晰度，而软件单目深度估计依赖不可靠的语义先验。现有的深度光学系统在制造复杂度和色差方面存在权衡。

Method: 设计了仿生全球面单中心镜头，通过深度变化的点扩散函数自然编码深度信息。建立了物理前向模型生成合成数据集，并与双头多尺度重建网络协同设计，共享编码器联合恢复图像和深度。

Result: 深度估计达到Abs Rel 0.026和RMSE 0.130，显著优于纯软件方法和其他深度光学系统。图像恢复SSIM为0.960，LPIPS为0.082，在图像保真度和深度精度间取得优越平衡。

Conclusion: 仿生全球面光学与联合重建算法的结合是解决高性能紧凑RGBD成像内在挑战的有效策略。

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本目标检测（FSOD）在只有少量新类样本可用时，常常面临基础类偏差和不稳定校准的问题。

Method: PDA是一种基于原型的度量头，与DeFRCN的线性分类器互补。它维护支持集原型在可学习的身份初始化投影空间中，可选地应用原型条件RoI对齐以减少几何不匹配。在微调期间，原型通过指数移动平均更新，无需引入类特定参数，并在推理时冻结以确保协议合规。

Result: 在VOC FSOD和GFSOD基准测试上的实验表明，PDA一致地提高了新类性能，对基础类影响最小，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: PDA是一种有效的轻量级插件方法，能够显著提升少样本目标检测中新类的性能，同时保持对基础类的影响最小。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: StreamingCoT数据集通过动态分层标注和显式推理链生成，有效解决了现有VideoQA数据集在时序演化和推理过程方面的不足，推动了流媒体视频理解领域的发展。

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

Motivation: 传统方法选择最具代表性的骨骼序列进行标注，但这些序列可能对动作识别器来说信息量不足，因为模型可能已经从之前见过的样本中获得了类似知识。

Result: 在三个3D动作识别基准数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于MDP框架的方法能够更智能地选择信息量丰富的样本进行标注，从而提高半监督3D动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Result: 放射组学模型达到84%准确率，显著优于CNN基础模型（p<0.05），在无专家标注情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: 基于放射组学的伪标签方法在冠状动脉钙化评分中有效，无需专家标注即可获得良好性能，为临床钙化检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全局提示调优在异构客户端上泛化能力差，而个性化调优容易过拟合本地数据且缺乏泛化性。需要一种既能适应数据异构性又能保持泛化能力的方法。

Method: 提出类上下文混合提示(CCMP)，结合全局共享提示和类特定提示，根据全局类原型和客户端类先验自适应组合提示，实现无需存储客户端依赖参数的单样本个性化。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、TinyImageNet、DomainNet和iNaturalist数据集上的综合评估表明，PEP-FedPT在不同数据异构场景下始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT为视觉Transformer的高效且可泛化的联邦提示调优建立了坚实基础，成功平衡了泛化与个性化需求。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: i-CIR数据集和BASIC方法为组合图像检索提供了更好的评估基准和有效的解决方案，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

Conclusion: 序列级别的描述生成和评估方法能够显著提升音频描述的连贯性和叙事质量，为视觉障碍观众提供更好的观影体验。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE
Journal of Oceanic Engineering Special Issue of AUV 2026.

*Zhi-Kai Chen,Jun-Peng Jiang,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hawk是一种利用图像空间结构来指导推测解码的方法，能够在保持图像质量和多样性的同时，将自回归图像生成模型的推理速度提升1.71倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型虽然能产生高质量图像，但由于其顺序解码过程导致推理速度缓慢。推测解码在文本生成中已证明有效，但在图像生成中应用不足，主要挑战包括更大的采样空间和二维空间结构利用不充分。

Method: 提出Hawk方法，利用图像的空间结构来指导推测模型进行更准确和高效的预测，通过更好地建模局部依赖关系来改善草稿模型与目标模型输出的对齐。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，Hawk实现了1.71倍的速度提升，同时保持了图像保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: Hawk通过有效利用图像的空间结构，成功将推测解码应用于图像生成领域，显著提升了自回归模型的推理效率而不损失生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Motivation: 当前虽然大模型在多模态空间推理方面展现出潜力，但缺乏系统性的综述和公开可用的基准测试，因此需要建立一个全面的评估框架来推动该领域的发展。

Method: 通过系统综述方法，对多模态空间推理任务进行分类整理，包括后训练技术、可解释性、架构设计，并涵盖2D/3D空间关系推理、场景理解、视觉问答、具身AI以及新兴模态如音频和第一人称视频。

Conclusion: 该综述为多模态空间推理领域奠定了坚实基础，提供了有价值的见解，并促进了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeArt3D是一个无需训练的铰接3D物体生成框架，通过将预训练的静态3D扩散模型重新用于铰接物体生成，将Score Distillation Sampling扩展到3D到4D领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有铰接3D物体建模方法要么需要密集视角监督，要么生成粗糙几何近似且忽略表面纹理。虽然静态3D生成已取得显著成功，但将其扩展到铰接物体面临重大挑战。

Method: 将铰接作为额外的生成维度，扩展Score Distillation Sampling到3D-to-4D领域。利用预训练静态3D扩散模型作为形状先验，给定不同铰接状态的几张图像，联合优化几何、纹理和铰接参数。

Result: 生成高保真几何和纹理，准确预测底层运动学结构，在多样化物体类别上泛化良好。尽管采用逐实例优化范式，但几分钟内完成，在质量和多功能性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeArt3D提供了一种无需任务特定训练或大规模铰接数据集的铰接3D物体生成解决方案，通过重新利用现有静态3D扩散模型实现了高质量铰接物体生成。

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

TL;DR: VFXMaster是一个统一的、基于参考的VFX视频生成框架，将特效生成重新定义为上下文学习任务，能够从参考视频中复制多样动态特效到目标内容，并展示出对未见特效类别的显著泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖"一个LoRA对应一个特效"的范式，这种方法资源密集且无法泛化到未见过的特效，限制了可扩展性和创作能力。

Method: 设计了上下文条件策略，通过参考示例提示模型；设计了上下文注意力掩码来精确解耦和注入关键特效属性；提出高效的单样本特效适应机制来快速提升对困难未见特效的泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效模仿各类特效信息，并对域外特效表现出出色的泛化能力。

Conclusion: VFXMaster是首个统一的、基于参考的VFX视频生成框架，能够解决现有方法的局限性，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理树结构的新度量方法（r-score）和调度算法（Re-Schedule），通过从结构简单到复杂的查询进行课程学习，显著提升了RLVR在数学推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR数据调度方法通常依赖基于路径的指标来排序查询，忽略了这些查询的推理树结构，导致调度效果受限。

Method: 引入推理分数（r-score）来基于推理树结构衡量查询的学习难度，并提出了推理树调度算法（Re-Schedule），构建从结构简单到复杂的课程学习进度。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，Re-Schedule显著提高了平均准确率，最高提升达3.2%。

Conclusion: 对推理树的结构理解为RLVR数据调度提供了更强大和原则性的基础，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

TL;DR: 研究循环结构因果模型中的反事实推断，关注shift-scale干预下的推理方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反事实推断框架假设无环结构因果模型，但现实系统（如生物系统）常包含反馈循环，违反无环性假设

Method: 研究循环SCMs中的反事实推断，特别关注shift-scale干预（软性、策略式变化，对变量机制进行缩放和/或平移）

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体结果

Conclusion: 需要扩展反事实推断框架以处理包含循环依赖关系的现实系统

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study
counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化E/M编码可以减轻医生文档负担，提高计费效率，最终改善患者护理质量

Method: 开发了基于LLM的ProFees框架，专门解决E/M编码中的现实复杂性

Result: 在专家策划的真实数据集上，ProFees比商业CPT E/M编码系统准确率提升36%，比最强单提示基线提升近5%

Conclusion: ProFees框架有效解决了E/M编码自动化中的现实复杂性，展示了其实际应用价值

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP)方法，通过显式状态跟踪和占位符后处理，解决LLM在游戏交易系统中无法遵循程序流程的问题，实现>99%状态合规性和99.3%计算精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM虽然支持动态游戏交互，但在规则治理的交易系统中无法遵循基本程序流程（浏览-报价-审查-确认），损害玩家信任。需要解决LLM创造性灵活性与游戏交易程序需求之间的核心矛盾。

Method: 引入ASTP方法，通过精心设计的提示词迫使LLM显式化其状态跟踪过程，让LLM识别并报告前一轮的预定义状态标签。配合状态特定的占位符后处理方法确保交易完整性。

Result: 在300个交易对话评估中，实现>99%状态合规性和99.3%计算精度。ASTP配合占位符后处理在较小模型(Gemini-2.5-Flash)上达到较大模型(Gemini-2.5-Pro)的性能，同时将响应时间从21.2秒降至2.4秒。

Conclusion: ASTP建立了满足商业游戏实时需求和资源约束的实用基础，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

Result: 在五个基准测试中，PM4GRPO显著优于现有的GRPO后训练方法

Conclusion: 利用过程挖掘进行推理感知的GRPO能有效增强策略模型的推理能力

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex
temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving
inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural,
semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work
introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon
Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal
alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large
language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align
quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of
Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized
experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware
specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major
stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1是一个基于多阶段课程强化学习的KBQA方法，通过结果监督训练LLM在知识库上进行自主推理，相比传统方法显著提升了推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KBQA方法通常通过过程监督微调LLM，但这种方法对探索的激励较弱，无法有效增强代理推理能力。

Method: 采用多阶段课程强化学习，首先在高质量轨迹上微调LLM建立基础能力，然后通过从易到难的奖励调度应用课程RL，缓解结果监督中的奖励稀疏问题。

Result: 在三个主流数据集上持续优于先前方法，在GrailQA的零样本子集上相对提升达11.1%，且仅使用十二分之一的训练数据。

Conclusion: 基于结果监督的KnowCoder-A1展现出强大的推理行为，证明了其在知识库问答中自主代理推理的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation展示了智能体系统作为自动化安全治理基础的潜力，提供模块化、可扩展和细粒度的安全执行

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAVR框架通过利用答案引导推理，解决了LLM在超出能力范围任务中难以生成高质量推理路径的问题，将难以学习的问题转化为可学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当LLM面对超出当前能力的任务时，难以生成高质量的推理路径，而强化学习可能会强化熟悉但次优的推理。受认知科学启发，"为什么是这个答案"比"答案是什么"更容易回答，因为前者避免了开放式探索的认知负担。

Method: 引入RAVR（参考答案引导的变分推理）框架，使用答案条件推理作为仅问题推理的变分替代，通过答案来推导高质量的推理路径。

Result: 在通用和数学领域的实验中，RAVR相比强基线模型表现出一致的改进，减少了犹豫，加强了结论整合，并促进了问题特定的推理策略。

Conclusion: 答案条件推理能够显著提高采样推理路径的期望效用，将难以处理的问题转化为可学习的问题，RAVR框架在多个领域都取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

TL;DR: FELA是一个基于LLM的多代理进化系统，用于从复杂的工业事件日志数据中自动提取高性能特征，通过专门代理的协作和进化算法实现持续改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业事件日志数据复杂且异构，现有自动特征工程方法存在可解释性差、操作僵化、适应性弱等问题，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 采用多代理系统（想法代理、代码代理、批评代理、评估代理）协作生成、验证和实施特征想法，结合强化学习和遗传算法原理进行代理进化。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上的实验表明，FELA能生成可解释的、领域相关的特征，显著提升模型性能并减少人工工作量。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的多代理系统有潜力成为复杂现实环境中自动化、可解释和自适应特征工程的通用框架。

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

Motivation: 解决精神疾病共病诊断的临床挑战，由于多种疾病同时发生的复杂性，需要更有效的诊断工具和数据集。

Method: 整合合成患者电子病历构建和多智能体诊断对话生成，使用分层状态机和上下文树将临床访谈协议转化为可执行框架，支持130多个诊断状态。

Conclusion: PsyCoTalk为精神疾病共病研究提供了宝贵资源，支持在单次对话中实现多障碍精神筛查模型的开发和评估。

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

TL;DR: GAP框架通过图基规划建模任务依赖关系，实现自适应并行和串行工具执行，显著提升多步推理场景中的执行效率和任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自主代理（如ReAct）依赖顺序推理和执行，无法利用独立子任务间的固有并行性，导致工具利用效率低下和多步推理性能不佳。

Method: 训练代理基础模型将复杂任务分解为依赖感知的子任务图，自主确定哪些工具可以并行执行、哪些必须遵循顺序依赖。采用两阶段训练策略：在高质量图基规划数据集上进行监督微调，然后对策略性采样查询进行基于正确性的强化学习。

Result: 在MHQA数据集上的实验结果表明，GAP显著优于传统ReAct基线，特别是在多步检索任务上，同时通过智能并行化实现了工具调用效率的显著提升。

Conclusion: GAP框架通过依赖感知的编排机制，在保持任务准确性的同时大幅提升了执行效率，为复杂任务解决提供了更高效的代理规划方法。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

TL;DR: 提出了KVDA-UCT算法，通过分析即时奖励推断价值差异，在MCTS中检测更多抽象状态-动作对，提升样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OGA-UCT算法要求状态-动作对具有相同的即时奖励，这一刚性条件限制了可发现的抽象数量，影响了MCTS的样本效率。

Method: 提出KVDA抽象框架，不要求价值等价，而是推断价值差异，并基于此修改OGA-UCT算法得到KVDA-UCT。

Result: KVDA-UCT在多种确定性环境和参数设置下检测到比OGA-UCT显著更多的抽象，性能更优。

Conclusion: KVDA框架通过推断价值差异而非要求价值等价，能够发现更多抽象，有效提升MCTS的样本效率。

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Conclusion: 智能体AI的未来不在于单一范式的支配，而在于两种范式的有意整合，以创建既具适应性又可靠的新型智能系统。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI对齐理论将工具性目标视为风险源，但本文认为这种观点过于消极，需要重新思考如何更好地处理这些目标。

Method: 借鉴亚里士多德本体论及其现代解释，构建了一个具体、目标导向实体的本体论框架，将高级AI系统视为其形式和物质构成产生与设计者意图不同效果的产物。

Result: 提出工具性倾向是AI系统构成的自然结果，而非意外故障，因此应该接受而非消除这些目标。

Conclusion: AI对齐工作应更多地关注理解、管理和引导工具性目标，使其服务于人类对齐的最终目的，而非试图完全消除这些目标。

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖静态执行反馈，限制了实时错误纠正能力。集成多轮工具调用和动态反馈可以显著提高适应性和鲁棒性，从而提升模型性能。

Method: 提出MTIR-SQL框架，引入执行感知的多轮推理范式，在每一步推理中无缝整合数据库执行反馈。扩展GRPO算法以适应复杂多轮交互场景，并添加轨迹过滤机制和移除KL损失约束来解决训练不稳定问题。

Conclusion: 多轮工具集成推理强化学习框架能够有效提升Text-to-SQL任务的性能，通过动态执行反馈和渐进式优化实现了更好的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed

recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense

paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query
decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,
and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a
standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and

mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

TL;DR: CAIR是首个评估AAW中各个智能体对最终输出影响程度的方法，通过反事实分析提供任务无关的分析，可用于离线和推理时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AAW系统的高自主性和广泛应用需要对其运作有更深入的理解，但目前缺乏评估单个智能体对最终输出影响的方法。

Method: 提出基于反事实分析的智能体影响排序方法CAIR，通过反事实分析来评估每个智能体对AAW输出的影响程度。

Result: 在包含30个不同用例和230个功能的AAW数据集上评估，CAIR产生一致的排名，优于基线方法，并能有效提升下游任务的效果和相关性。

Conclusion: CAIR是首个能够评估AAW中智能体影响的方法，为理解和优化多智能体系统提供了有效工具。

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

TL;DR: ALDEN是一个多轮强化学习框架，通过将视觉语言模型训练为交互式智能体，使其能够主动导航长文档。它引入了直接按索引访问页面的fetch动作，并提出了跨层级奖励和视觉语义锚定机制来解决训练稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定的推理模板或刚性流程，使视觉语言模型处于被动角色，限制了效率和泛化能力。需要让模型能够主动导航和分析跨多页的复杂视觉文档。

Method: 使用多轮强化学习框架微调视觉语言模型，引入fetch动作直接按索引访问页面，提出基于规则的跨层级奖励进行密集过程监督，以及视觉语义锚定机制来稳定训练。

Result: 在三个开源数据集构建的语料库上训练，ALDEN在五个长文档基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ALDEN标志着从被动文档阅读向能够自主导航和推理长视觉文档的智能体迈出了一步，为更准确高效的长文档理解提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

TL;DR: 基于深度强化学习的无人机最优导航策略，在三维城市湍流环境中使用PPO+GTrXL架构，显著提高了成功率和降低了碰撞率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机在城市区域用于配送和监控的日益普及，需要在复杂的湍流环境中开发有效的导航策略

Method: 采用基于PPO的流感知深度强化学习算法，结合GTrXL架构，为无人机提供更丰富的湍流场信息

Result: 与PPO+LSTM、PPO+GTrXL（无次级预测任务）和传统Zermelo导航算法相比，显著提高了成功率并降低了碰撞率

Conclusion: 该方法为在复杂城市环境中重新构想无人机应用铺平了道路

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

TL;DR: BambooKG是一种基于频率权重的知识图谱，在非三元组边添加权重以反映链接强度，减少信息损失，提升单跳和多跳推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成方法独立处理检索块，难以进行多跳或关系推理；知识图谱虽能捕获实体关系，但会丢失不符合三元组结构的信息。

Method: 引入BambooKG知识图谱，在非三元组边应用基于频率的权重，借鉴"一起激发，一起连接"的Hebbian原则来反映链接强度。

Result: 减少了信息损失，在单跳和多跳推理任务上表现优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: BambooKG通过频率权重机制有效增强知识图谱的推理能力，解决了传统方法在多跳推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

Conclusion: 双循环设计在模拟战略性、自适应和纵向治疗行为方面有效，验证了其在心理咨询中的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.
