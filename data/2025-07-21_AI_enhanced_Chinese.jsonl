In recent years, advancements in Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new\nheights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,\ntraditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting\npredefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The\nadvent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this\nlimitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can\nidentify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This\nbreakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in\naerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD\nin the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles\nof OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a\nspecialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic\ntaxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides\na comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review\nenables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the\nintersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline\npromising future research directions and application prospects.

PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science\nprinciple known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable\ncounterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic\ntraining data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,\nhumor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that\nlearns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.\nThis approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse\nevaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social\ncommunities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by\n46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,\nPrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:\nscholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented\ncommunities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities\nemphasize empathy.

Forecast stability (i.e.,\nconsistency between forecast cycles with different lead times) is particularly\nimportant for \"pre-tactical\" contrail avoidance strategies that adjust routes\nbased on forecasts with lead times as long as 24-48 hours. However, no study to\ndate has systematically quantified the degree to which forecast stability\nlimits the effectiveness of pre-tactical avoidance. This study addresses this\ngap by comparing contrail forecasts generated using ECMWF HRES weather\nforecasts with lead times up to 48 hours to contrail hindcasts generated based\non ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. An analysis of forecast errors shows low pointwise\nconsistency between persistent-contrail-forming regions in forecasts and\nreanalysis, with pointwise error rates similar to those found in previous\ncomparisons of contrail-forming regions in reanalysis and reality. However, we\nalso show that spatial errors in the locations of contrail-forming regions are\nrelatively small, both when forecasts are compared to reanalysis and when\nreanalysis is compared to in-situ measurements. Finally, we show that designing\na trajectory optimizer to take advantage of relatively small spatial errors\nallows flight trajectory optimizations based on contrail forecasts to reduce\ncontrail climate forcing evaluated based on reanalysis by 80-90% at the 8-24\nhour lead times most relevant to flight planning, with fuel penalties under\n0.4%.

When a student combines several steps in one step, the number of possible\npaths connecting consecutive inputs may be very large. This combinatorial\nexplosion makes error diagnosis hard. Using a final answer to diagnose a\ncombination of steps can mitigate the combinatorial explosion, because there\nare generally fewer possible (erroneous) final answers than (erroneous)\nsolution paths. An intermediate input for a task can be diagnosed by\nautomatically completing it according to the task solution strategy and\ndiagnosing this solution. This study explores the potential of automated error\ndiagnosis based on a final answer. We investigate the design of a service that\nprovides a buggy rule diagnosis when a student combines several steps. To\nvalidate the approach, we apply the service to an existing dataset (n=1939) of\nunique student steps when solving quadratic equations, which could not be\ndiagnosed by a buggy rule service that tries to connect consecutive inputs with\na single rule.

To address\nthese challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework\ndesigned to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving\ndetection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:\nFrequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which\nrefines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency\nfiltering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive\nHierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively\nintegrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen\nhierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,\nand Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation\ncapabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while\nreducing model complexity.

Traditional watermarking\ntechniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their\neffectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel\nin-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable\nconcepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable\nwatermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or\nperturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic\nattributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to\nadversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image\naugmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of\nwatermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,\ndemonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining\nimage quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking\ntechniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce\nIConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with\nStegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against\nmultiple types of image manipulations.

While recent advances in LLMs show\npromise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low\nsuccess rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning\nabilities to new kernels.

While uncertainty estimation in the SfM\nstage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the\nreprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and\nnon-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal\nnature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an\nuncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error\ncovariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry\nprocess. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose\na novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)\nper-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such\nas matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,\nour method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the\nMVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering\nto error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a\nrobust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We\nevaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV\nimagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing\napproaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6444\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u8054\u8bef\u5dee\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u89e3\u51b3MVS\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6444\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14MVS\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5c1a\u672a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528MVS\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u591a\u89c6\u70b9\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u5dee\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5339\u914d\u6210\u672c\u503c\u7b49\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fb9\u754c\u7387\u4e14\u672a\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6444\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, the sole\nusage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of\nhybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF\nrepresentation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar\ngeneration qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their\ndeformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the\ndeformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational\ncosts on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points\nare located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but\nresult in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we\npropose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel\nefficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In\nEPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray\nomission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that\nprogress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval\non the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.\nThe delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational\ncost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important\nregions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without\nhierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the\ngeneration quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around\n20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.\nWe provide video results on https://github.com/seungjun-moon/epsilon.", "AI": {"tldr": "EPSilon\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff08ERO\u548cEIO\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u57fa\u4e8eNeRF\u548cSMPL\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08NeRF+SMPL\uff09\u56e0\u53d8\u5f62\u65b9\u6848\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u800cEPSilon\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7a7a\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u7a7a\u5c04\u7ebf\u5ffd\u7565\uff08ERO\uff09\u548c\u7a7a\u533a\u95f4\u5ffd\u7565\uff08EIO\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "EPSilon\u4ec5\u97003.9%\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea620\u500d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53474\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "EPSilon\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the\nlearned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and\nobjects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of\nmonocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues.

However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion\nrepresentation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing\napproaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video\nframes, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to\ninconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free\nEncapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both\nvisual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach\nutilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video\nframes by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing\nthem with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to\nensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior\ninto the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of\nboth types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion\nquality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach\ncompared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a\nsignificant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time.

To enhance the\ndiscriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image\ndescriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and\nedge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an\nimage. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is\nused to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid\nsearch.

Pre-trained diffusion models have been\nincreasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing\nmethods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance\nscale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect\ndegradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,\nresulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose\nDynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any\nblindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry\nimages and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the\nstarting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during\nthe diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity.

To further improve robustness, we incorporate\nInterquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error\ncriterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on\nsynthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based\nbaselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high\nobject density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it\nwell-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "C-DOG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5173\u8054\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6781\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u63d0\u53473D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5173\u8054\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u65f6\u5931\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u63a5delta-overlap\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6781\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408IQR\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c3D\u53cd\u6295\u5f71\u8bef\u5dee\u5254\u9664\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u76ee\u6807\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u65e0\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6709\u9650\u76f8\u673a\u91cd\u53e0\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "C-DOG\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in\nSSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to\nlarge codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to\naccount for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we\nintroduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on\nnested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features\ninto increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,\nenabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a\nnovel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional\nbiases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic\ncontent. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions\nestablish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and\nopen a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for\nthe broader AI community.
