While most\nexisting approaches leverage LLMs for code generation to create or refine\nspecific heuristics, they often overlook the structural properties of\nindividual problem instances. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that\nintegrates LLMs with a Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) to solve the\nNP-hard Longest Run Subsequence problem. Our approach extends the\ninstance-driven heuristic bias paradigm by introducing a human-LLM\ncollaborative process to co-design and implement a set of computationally\nefficient metrics. The LLM analyzes these instance-specific metrics to generate\na tailored heuristic bias, which steers the BRKGA toward promising areas of the\nsearch space. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation, including\nrigorous statistical tests, convergence and behavioral analyses, and targeted\nablation studies, comparing our method against a standard BRKGA baseline across\n1,050 generated instances of varying complexity. Results show that our\ntop-performing hybrid, BRKGA+Llama-4-Maverick, achieves statistically\nsignificant improvements over the baseline, particularly on the most complex\ninstances. Our findings confirm that leveraging an LLM to produce an a priori,\ninstance-driven heuristic bias is a valuable approach for enhancing\nmetaheuristics in complex optimization domains."}

Recently,\nfeature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by\ncaching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the\nfollowing timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models\nwhile ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we\nintroduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and\ncomplementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa\nperforms spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token\nin each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which\nis able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on\nDiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image\nand text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any\ndiffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa\nachieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing\nthe original model by 0.51%.

With advances in deep learning, neural network-based\ncompression methods have emerged.

At the receiver end, the\nbitstream is entropy-decoded, and a decoder reconstructs an approximation of\nthe original image. Recent research suggests that these models consistently\noutperform conventional codecs.
