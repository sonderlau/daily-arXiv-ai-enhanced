### [1] [Beyond the Training Data: Confidence-Guided Mixing of Parameterizations in a Hybrid AI-Climate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08107)
*Helge Heuer,Tom Beucler,Mierk Schwabe,Julien Savre,Manuel Schlund,Veronika Eyring*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将机器学习对流参数化方案从ClimSim成功迁移到ICON-A地球系统模型的方法，通过误差预测和混合方案实现了稳定且可调谐的AI-物理混合模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决地球系统模型中由于次网格尺度对流和湍流参数化导致的系统性误差，以及机器学习参数化在长期模拟中的不稳定性问题。

Method: 使用ClimSim调整数据训练物理信息神经网络对流参数化，集成到ICON-A中，并预测自身误差以与传统方案混合，通过添加输入噪声增强稳定性。

Result: 在AMIP设置中，多个混合配置优于默认对流方案（如改进降水统计），混合和纯ML方案都能实现至少20年的稳定模拟并保持物理一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了机器学习参数化在不同地球系统模型间的迁移，通过可调谐的混合方案改善了过程理解，为稳定的AI-物理混合模拟提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Persistent systematic errors in Earth system models (ESMs) arise from
difficulties in representing the full diversity of subgrid, multiscale
atmospheric convection and turbulence. Machine learning (ML) parameterizations
trained on short high-resolution simulations show strong potential to reduce
these errors. However, stable long-term atmospheric simulations with hybrid
(physics + ML) ESMs remain difficult, as neural networks (NNs) trained offline
often destabilize online runs. Training convection parameterizations directly
on coarse-grained data is challenging, notably because scales cannot be cleanly
separated. This issue is mitigated using data from superparameterized
simulations, which provide clearer scale separation. Yet, transferring a
parameterization from one ESM to another remains difficult due to distribution
shifts that induce large inference errors. Here, we present a proof-of-concept
where a ClimSim-trained, physics-informed NN convection parameterization is
successfully transferred to ICON-A. The scheme is (a) trained on adjusted
ClimSim data with subtracted radiative tendencies, and (b) integrated into
ICON-A. The NN parameterization predicts its own error, enabling mixing with a
conventional convection scheme when confidence is low, thus making the hybrid
AI-physics model tunable with respect to observations and reanalysis through
mixing parameters. This improves process understanding by constraining
convective tendencies across column water vapor, lower-tropospheric stability,
and geographical conditions, yielding interpretable regime behavior. In
AMIP-style setups, several hybrid configurations outperform the default
convection scheme (e.g., improved precipitation statistics). With additive
input noise during training, both hybrid and pure-ML schemes lead to stable
simulations and remain physically consistent for at least 20 years.

### [2] [A Digital Pheromone-Based Approach for In/Out-of-Control Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07329)
*Pedro Pestana,M. Fátima Brilhante*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出一种基于蚁群优化的生物启发方法，用于工业生产线实时状态分类和预测维护，通过模拟蚂蚁信息素行为构建评分系统来监测系统控制状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂生产线中需要快速准确判断系统是否处于控制状态，传统方法可能不够灵活或难以解释。

Method: 将温度读数序列视为数字蚂蚁，通过虚拟信息素沉积、威胁检测和环境评分构建总分系统，模拟真实蚁群行为。

Result: 开发了一个自适应且可解释的框架，能够实时分类系统状态并预测从控制到失控的转变。

Conclusion: 蚁群优化启发的生物模拟方法为工业过程监控和预测性维护提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex production lines, it is essential to have strict, fast-acting
rules to determine whether the system is In Control (InC) or Out of Control
(OutC). This study explores a bio-inspired method that digitally mimics ant
colony behavior to classify InC/OutC states and forecast imminent transitions
requiring maintenance. A case study on industrial potato chip frying provides
the application context. During each two-minute frying cycle, sequences of
eight temperature readings are collected. Each sequence is treated as a digital
ant depositing virtual pheromones, generating a Base Score. New sequences,
representing new ants, can either reinforce or weaken this score, leading to a
Modified Base Score that reflects the system's evolving condition. Signals such
as extreme temperatures, large variations within a sequence, or the detection
of change-points contribute to a Threat Score, which is added to the Modified
Base Score. Since pheromones naturally decay over time unless reinforced, an
Environmental Score is incorporated to reflect recent system dynamics,
imitating real ant behavior. This score is calculated from the Modified Base
Scores collected over the past hour. The resulting Total Score - the sum of the
Modified Base Score, Threat Score, and Environmental Score - is used as the
main indicator for real-time system classification and forecasting of
transitions from InC to OutC. This ant colony optimization-inspired approach
provides an adaptive and interpretable framework for process monitoring and
predictive maintenance in industrial environments.

### [3] [Learning Neuron Dynamics within Deep Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07341)
*Eric Jahns,Davi Moreno,Michel A. Kinsy*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出可学习神经元模型(LNMs)，通过参数化非线性整合发放动态，在训练中学习神经元动态，提升深度脉冲神经网络性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度SNNs依赖简单的LIF神经元模型，无法捕捉丰富的时间动态。虽然存在更复杂的神经元模型，但需要手动调参且难以扩展

Method: 引入LNMs作为通用的参数化非线性整合发放动态公式，使用低阶多项式参数化实现高效稳定的训练

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS等多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: LNMs为构建更可扩展和高性能的脉冲架构提供了有前景的路径

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising energy-efficient alternative
to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by utilizing sparse and asynchronous
processing through discrete spike-based computation. However, the performance
of deep SNNs remains limited by their reliance on simple neuron models, such as
the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, which cannot capture rich temporal
dynamics. While more expressive neuron models exist, they require careful
manual tuning of hyperparameters and are difficult to scale effectively. This
difficulty is evident in the lack of successful implementations of complex
neuron models in high-performance deep SNNs. In this work, we address this
limitation by introducing Learnable Neuron Models (LNMs). LNMs are a general,
parametric formulation for non-linear integrate-and-fire dynamics that learn
neuron dynamics during training. By learning neuron dynamics directly from
data, LNMs enhance the performance of deep SNNs. We instantiate LNMs using
low-degree polynomial parameterizations, enabling efficient and stable
training. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in a variety of datasets,
including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS. LNMs offer a
promising path toward more scalable and high-performing spiking architectures.

Abstract: This paper presents a rotation-invariant embedded platform for simulating
(neural) cellular automata (NCA) in modular robotic systems. Inspired by
previous work on physical NCA, we introduce key innovations that overcome
limitations in prior hardware designs. Our platform features a symmetric,
modular structure, enabling seamless connections between cells regardless of
orientation. Additionally, each cell is battery-powered, allowing it to operate
independently and retain its state even when disconnected from the collective.
To demonstrate the platform's applicability, we present a novel
rotation-invariant NCA model for isotropic shape classification. The proposed
system provides a robust foundation for exploring the physical realization of
NCA, with potential applications in distributed robotic systems and
self-organizing structures. Our implementation, including hardware, software
code, a simulator, and a video, is openly shared at:

### [5] [Co-design is powerful and not free](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08368)
*Yi Zhang,Yue Xie,Tao Sun,Fumiya Iida*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的框架，将形态和控制参数嵌入单个神经网络中，实现端到端的联合优化。研究表明，当形态与任务不匹配时（如靠近障碍物或工作空间边界），协同设计具有明显优势；而当基线形态已具备足够能力时，仅优化控制通常能达到或超过协同设计的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人性能源于身体和控制器的耦合，但目前尚不清楚何时需要形态控制协同设计。本文旨在明确在什么情况下仅优化控制就足够，什么情况下需要形态控制协同设计。

Method: 提出了一个统一框架，将形态和控制参数嵌入单个神经网络中，实现端到端的联合优化。通过在静态障碍物约束下的到达任务案例研究进行评估。

Result: 结果显示，当形态与任务不匹配时（如靠近障碍物或工作空间边界），协同设计具有明显优势，结构适应简化了控制；而当基线形态已具备足够能力时，仅优化控制通常能达到或超过协同设计的效果。

Conclusion: 通过明确何时仅优化控制就足够、何时不够，这项工作推进了对具身智能的理解，并为具身感知的机器人设计提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Robotic performance emerges from the coupling of body and controller, yet it
remains unclear when morphology-control co-design is necessary. We present a
unified framework that embeds morphology and control parameters within a single
neural network, enabling end-to-end joint optimization. Through case studies in
static-obstacle-constrained reaching, we evaluate trajectory error, success
rate, and collision probability. The results show that co-design provides clear
benefits when morphology is poorly matched to the task, such as near obstacles
or workspace boundaries, where structural adaptation simplifies control.
Conversely, when the baseline morphology already affords sufficient capability,
control-only optimization often matches or exceeds co-design. By clarifying
when control is enough and when it is not, this work advances the understanding
of embodied intelligence and offers practical guidance for embodiment-aware
robot design.

### [6] [Enhancing Maritime Object Detection in Real-Time with RT-DETR and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07346)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于RT-DETR的实时海上目标检测系统，通过增强合成图像和多尺度特征融合等技术，解决了小目标检测和真实数据不足的问题，在保持实时性能的同时提升了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临小目标尺寸和真实RGB数据标注有限的挑战，需要开发能够在真实数据上严格评估的实时检测系统。

Method: 采用RT-DETR架构，结合多尺度特征融合、不确定性最小化查询选择和合成/真实训练样本权重平衡策略，并使用数据增强技术平衡数据集类别。

Result: 开发了完整的Python鲁棒海上检测流水线，即使在极端光照或海况下也能保持实时性能，并通过组件分析量化了各架构模块的贡献。

Conclusion: 该系统在保持DETR端到端集合预测优势的同时，允许用户在推理时调整速度与精度平衡，有效缩小了合成与真实域之间的视觉差距。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [7] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DynamicEval基准，专注于评估文本到视频模型在动态相机运动下的表现，包含4.5万个人工标注和新的背景/前景一致性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V评估基准存在两个问题：忽视动态相机运动的重要性，以及过度依赖模型级评分而忽略视频级评估。

Method: 构建包含动态相机运动提示词的基准，收集4.5万个人工标注，提出基于物体错误图的背景一致性指标和基于点跟踪的前景一致性指标。

Result: 新指标在视频级和模型级评估中与人类偏好相关性提高了2%以上，能更好地处理遮挡/去遮挡情况。

Conclusion: DynamicEval为动态相机运动下的T2V模型评估提供了更全面的基准，新指标显著提升了与人类判断的一致性。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [8] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RISP方法，通过重启惯性和基于分数的图像先验，在解决病态成像逆问题时实现快速收敛和高质量重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RED专注于设计复杂图像先验来提高重建质量，但收敛加速依赖启发式方法，缺乏理论保证

Method: RISP结合了重启惯性机制实现快速收敛，同时使用基于分数的图像先验保证重建质量，是RED的原则性扩展

Result: RISP比RED获得更快的驻点收敛速度，且不要求图像先验的凸性，实验证明在多种成像逆问题中都能快速收敛并获得高质量重建

Conclusion: RISP通过重启惯性和基于分数的先验，在理论和实验上都证明了其在成像逆问题中的优越性能

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [9] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像纯化策略的创新去噪框架，通过生成结构对齐的超低剂量CT图像对，结合频域流匹配模型，在真实临床数据集上实现了最先进的解剖结构保持效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量CT显著降低辐射暴露但引入严重噪声和伪影，导致与正常剂量CT图像对之间存在显著空间错位，这给现有去噪网络在真实临床场景中的应用带来挑战。

Method: 首先构建真实临床uLDCT肺部数据集，提出图像纯化策略生成结构对齐的uLDCT-NDCT图像对，然后提出频域流匹配模型与IP策略协同工作，保持去噪图像的解剖结构完整性。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上的实验表明，IP策略显著提升了多个主流去噪模型在uLDCT任务上的性能，提出的FFM模型结合IP策略在解剖结构保持方面达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 本研究为真实世界uLDCT去噪中的数据不匹配问题提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available
at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.

### [10] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为D2RA的训练免费、单图像攻击方法，能够在资源受限的对抗环境下有效移除或削弱水印，无需访问底层模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型的广泛使用，确保内容归属和溯源的水印方法需求日益增长。尽管现有的语义水印方案通过在潜在或频率表示中嵌入信号来提高鲁棒性，但它们在资源受限的对抗设置下仍然脆弱。

Method: D2RA通过将带水印图像投影到互补表示的自然先验上，抑制水印信号同时保持视觉保真度。这是一种无需训练、仅需单张图像的方法。

Result: 在多种水印方案上的实验表明，该方法能持续降低水印可检测性，揭示了当前水印设计的基本弱点。

Conclusion: D2RA攻击方法暴露了现有水印方案的脆弱性，为改进水印鲁棒性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [11] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle是一个视频风格迁移框架，通过低秩适配器和合成训练数据，在保持视频内容的同时实现文本指定的风格转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频风格迁移中缺乏配对视频数据监督的挑战，同时保持视频内容的连贯性和风格的准确性。

Method: 在预训练视频扩散模型中插入低秩适配器，利用配对静态图像数据构建合成训练片段，并引入上下文-风格分类器自由引导机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了时间连贯、风格忠实且内容保持的视频转换，在定性和定量评估上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PickStyle框架通过有效的适配器设计和训练策略，成功解决了视频风格迁移中的关键挑战，实现了高质量的视频风格转换。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [12] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出TRAVL方法，通过平衡训练数据和轨迹感知注意力模块来改进视频语言模型对物理合理性的判断能力，并创建了ImplausiBench基准来评估模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频生成模型经常产生违反物理规律的序列，但目前缺乏定量评估物理真实性的方法，现有视频语言模型在识别物理违规方面存在困难。

Method: 引入TRAVL微调方法，结合平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块，改进运动编码和判别能力；提出ImplausiBench基准，包含300个视频（150个真实，150个生成），消除语言偏见并隔离视觉-时间理解。

Result: 通过TRAVL方法改进了视频语言模型的物理合理性判断能力，在ImplausiBench基准上使用人类判断和LLM-as-judge指标进行评估。

Conclusion: TRAVL和ImplausiBench为探索和改进多模态模型中的物理合理性提供了统一框架，揭示了视觉-时间理解中具有挑战性且未被充分探索的方面。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出S3FN网络，利用LLM生成类别文本描述来增强高光谱图像分类，通过语义-光谱-空间融合提升分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高光谱图像分类中训练样本有限、数据维度高导致的过拟合问题，以及传统单模态方法仅依赖光谱空间数据的局限性

Method: 使用LLM为每个类别生成文本描述，通过BERT或RoBERTa等预训练文本编码器将描述嵌入向量空间，实现语义-光谱-空间融合

Result: 在Hyperspectral Wood、HyperspectralBlueberries和DeepHS-Fruit三个基准数据集上取得显著性能提升

Conclusion: 文本语义与光谱空间数据的协同作用为语义增强的高光谱图像分类模型开辟了新途径

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CAGUL框架，一种轻量级的视觉语言模型遗忘方法，通过跨模态注意力引导来防止敏感信息泄露，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆敏感信息，并在推理时泄露。现有的遗忘方法主要针对LLMs，而VLMs由于视觉上下文的复杂性需要专门解决方案。

Method: 利用跨模态注意力分析视觉token对输出的重要性，通过外部模块在重要性较低的视觉token中编码遗忘信息，不改变预训练模型参数。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法优于或与基于微调的基线方法相当，能有效防止信息泄露并保持参考模型行为。

Conclusion: CAGUL为VLMs提供了一种实用且有效的遗忘解决方案，无需改变预训练参数或承担重新训练成本。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [15] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaizeStandCounting (MaSC) 是一个基于RGB图像和YOLOv9模型的自动化玉米幼苗计数算法，可在低成本硬件上运行，支持两种处理模式：拼接图像分块和原始视频帧对齐，能准确区分玉米和杂草，实现行级精确计数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工计数玉米植株耗时费力且易出错，特别是在大面积或变化较大的田地中。需要开发自动化、低成本且准确的计数方法，以支持产量预测、种植密度优化和早期发芽问题检测。

Method: MaSC采用两种处理模式：1）将拼接图像分割成小块；2）使用单应性矩阵对齐原始视频帧。两种模式都使用轻量级YOLOv9模型检测V2-V10生长阶段的玉米幼苗，通过空间分布进行行和范围分割，实现精确的行级计数。

Result: 与2024年夏季苗圃实地人工计数相比，MaSC表现出与真实数据的高度一致性（拼接图像R^2=0.616，原始帧R^2=0.906）。算法处理83张全分辨率帧仅需60.63秒，包括推理和后处理，具备实时操作潜力。

Conclusion: MaSC被证明是一个可扩展、低成本且准确的自动化玉米植株计数工具，适用于研究和生产环境，为作物管理和研究提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Quick-CapsNet（QCN）作为CapsNet的快速替代方案，通过减少胶囊数量实现5倍推理速度提升，但准确率略有损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet虽然在某些任务上表现优于传统CNN，但训练和推理速度较慢，这限制了其在需要快速网络的实时应用中的使用。

Method: 通过减少胶囊数量来构建更快的网络，同时采用更强大的解码器来进一步提升性能。

Result: 在MNIST、F-MNIST、SVHN和Cifar-10数据集上实现了5倍的推理速度提升，准确率仅有轻微下降。

Conclusion: QCN是CapsNet的快速替代方案，为开发用于快速实时应用的胶囊网络提供了起点。

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Rectified-CFG++，一种自适应预测-校正引导方法，解决了标准CFG在整流流模型中的离流形漂移问题，通过几何感知的条件规则确保轨迹稳定在数据流形附近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分类器自由引导在整流流模型中会引起严重的离流形漂移，导致视觉伪影、文本不对齐和脆弱行为，需要一种更稳定的引导方法。

Method: 结合条件整流流更新和加权条件校正，首先执行条件RF更新将样本锚定在学习到的传输路径附近，然后应用在条件和无条件速度场之间插值的加权校正。

Result: 在Flux、Stable Diffusion 3/3.5、Lumina等大规模文本到图像模型上的实验表明，Rectified-CFG++在MS-COCO、LAION-Aesthetic和T2I-CompBench等基准数据集上始终优于标准CFG。

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++能够确保速度场的边际一致性，其轨迹保持在数据流形的有界管状邻域内，在广泛的引导强度范围内保持稳定性。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在图像和视频质量评估方面取得了显著进展，但在3D资产领域尚未充分探索。希望利用这些模型进行无参考点云质量评估，自动评估点云的感知质量。

Method: 构建PIT-QMM模型，能够端到端消费文本、图像和点云来预测质量分数。利用不同模态数据（文本描述、2D投影和3D点云视图）提供的互补信息。

Result: 在流行基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，且训练迭代次数更少。框架还支持失真定位和识别，为模型可解释性和交互性开辟了新途径。

Conclusion: PIT-QMM为无参考点云质量评估提供了有效的解决方案，在多模态融合和模型可解释性方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动作分割方法多为单流方法，主要建模帧序列的时空特征。本文探索引入第二个动作特征流来捕捉动作和动作转换线索，以提升分割性能

Method: 提出DSA Net双流网络，使用时间上下文块融合双流信息，包含交叉注意力和量子动作引导调制。采用双流对齐损失，包含关系一致性、跨层对比和循环一致性重建三个组件

Result: 在GTEA、Breakfast、50Salads和EgoProcel等多个基准数据集上评估，DSA Net达到最先进性能，显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 这是首个将混合量子-经典机器学习框架用于动作分割的研究，双流特征对齐方法有效提升了动作分割性能

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出OIE方法，基于首帧衣物替换的视频虚拟试穿策略，通过图像模型替换首帧衣物，然后利用姿态和掩码信息引导视频生成模型合成后续帧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双分支架构在基于U-Net的扩散模型中成功，但难以适应基于Diffusion Transformer的模型，存在参数过多和衣物特征缺乏时序特性等问题。

Method: 使用图像衣物替换模型处理首帧，然后在编辑后的首帧内容控制下，利用姿态和掩码信息引导视频生成模型顺序合成剩余帧。

Result: 实验表明该方法在参数效率和计算效率方面表现优异，同时在约束条件下保持领先性能。

Conclusion: OIE方法通过首帧替换策略有效解决了现有方法的挑战，实现了高效且性能优越的视频虚拟试穿。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

### [21] [MONKEY: Masking ON KEY-Value Activation Adapter for Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07656)
*James Baker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用IP-Adapter自动生成掩码的方法，在推理过程中将图像标记限制在主体区域，让文本提示能够关注图像其余部分，从而在个性化扩散模型中更好地平衡主体生成和文本提示控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化扩散模型在生成包含特定主体的图像时，往往过度关注主体而忽略文本提示，导致生成的图像只是简单重现主体图像，缺乏对文本描述的响应。

Method: 利用IP-Adapter自动生成掩码来分割主体和背景，在第二次处理过程中使用该掩码限制图像标记仅作用于主体区域，使文本提示能够控制背景和其他图像内容。

Result: 对于描述位置和地点的文本提示，该方法能够准确描绘主体同时精确匹配提示内容，相比其他测试时个性化方法，显示出更高的提示和源图像对齐度。

Conclusion: 通过自动掩码生成和二次处理策略，有效解决了个性化扩散模型中主体生成与文本控制之间的平衡问题，显著提升了生成图像的质量和可控性。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

Method: 比较了标准Transformer方法、小型VLM（Phi3.5-vision）、大型预训练VLM（Gemini）以及处理多图像的扩展Transformer在Crello数据集上的表现。

Result: 标准Transformer模型总体上优于VLM方法，特别是在包含更丰富外观信息时。但所有方法在处理非常小的文本或密集布局时都面临挑战。

Conclusion: 任务特定架构具有优势，为自动布局设计的进一步改进提供了方向。

Abstract: In layout design for advertisements and web pages, balancing visual appeal

placement in incomplete layouts, comparing a standard Transformer-based method,
a small Vision and Language Model (Phi3.5-vision), a large pretrained VLM

Evaluations on the Crello dataset show the standard Transformer-based models
generally outperform VLM-based approaches, particularly when incorporating
richer appearance information. However, all methods face challenges with very
small text or densely populated layouts. These findings highlight the benefits
of task-specific architectures and suggest avenues for further improvement in

TL;DR: 提出TCIP模型，通过特征增强残差模块(FERM)解决金字塔网络中解剖结构错位累积问题，采用双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略自适应确定迭代次数，在多个医学影像数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金字塔网络在可变形医学图像配准中性能优越，但其解码器架构容易传播和累积解剖结构错位，且现有模型无法自适应确定不同图像所需的迭代次数，导致配准精度下降。

Method: 提出特征增强残差模块(FERM)作为金字塔网络解码层的核心组件，包含三个顺序块：提取解剖语义特征、抑制无关特征、估计最终变形场。同时提出双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略，第一阶段评估配准稳定性，第二阶段评估收敛性。

Result: 在三个公共脑部MRI数据集和一个腹部CT数据集上的实验表明，TCIP在准确性方面优于最先进的配准网络，同时保持相当的推理速度和紧凑的模型参数大小。

Conclusion: TCIP模型通过FERM和TCI有效解决了金字塔网络中的解剖错位累积和迭代次数自适应问题，在医学图像配准中表现出优越性能，具有良好的通用性。

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型通常针对固定输入格式训练，而实际视频工作流需要从精确的4D对象轨迹到粗略文本提示等不同粒度的用户控制混合。

Method: 将任务建模为变分推断来近似组合分布，使用多个视频生成主干网络；通过逐步KL散度最小化解决优化挑战，并提出上下文条件分解技术减少解空间模式以避免局部最优。

Result: 实验表明，该方法相比先前工作能生成具有更好可控性、多样性和3D一致性的样本。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了视频合成中混合粒度控制的需求，在保持未指定元素多样性的同时，为指定元素提供高可控性。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于中心的方法虽然能有效捕捉全局数据分布，但往往忽略了重要的局部相似性信息，而基于成对的方法在这方面表现更好。

Method: 采用双分支结构：强分支基于中心方法，弱分支基于成对方法。通过相互学习过程和混合哈希专家模块实现跨分支知识迁移。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，MLH始终优于最先进的哈希方法。

Conclusion: MLH框架成功地将局部相似性信息整合到全局结构建模中，实现了哈希检索性能的显著提升。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Repainter框架在电商图像修复任务中表现出色，特别是在复杂构图场景下，为解决商业环境中的图像修复挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

Conclusion: SyncHuman展示了未来3D生成模型的一个有前景的方向，通过整合2D和3D生成模型的互补优势实现高质量重建。

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: ComGS框架通过SOPs和扩散模型光照估计，有效解决了高斯溅射中物体-场景合成的一致性问题，实现了高效、高质量的实时渲染和快速编辑。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraLED是一个两阶段框架，使用单张短曝光RAW图像进行超高动态范围重建，通过曝光校正和亮度感知RAW降噪来恢复暗区细节，避免重影和运动模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高动态范围场景中亮区和暗区曝光差异大的问题，避免RGB包围曝光方法的重影和对齐问题，利用RAW图像的高位深和可预测噪声特性来恢复暗区信息。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先通过比率图进行曝光校正以平衡动态范围，然后使用亮度感知RAW降噪器增强暗区细节恢复；构建9档包围曝光管道合成真实UHDR图像数据集。

Result: 实验表明UltraLED显著优于现有的单帧方法，能够有效恢复暗区细节同时保留高光细节。

Conclusion: 仅使用单张短曝光RAW图像即可实现超高动态范围重建，该方法在动态场景中特别鲁棒，避免了重影和运动模糊问题。

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合低帧率RGB视频和高帧率事件流来重建动态3D高斯泼溅的方法，通过事件运动先验指导变形场优化，解决大帧间运动带来的不确定性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从低帧率RGB视频重建动态3D高斯泼溅具有挑战性，因为大帧间运动会增加解空间的不确定性。事件相机可以异步捕捉快速视觉变化且对运动模糊具有鲁棒性，但缺乏颜色信息。结合两种模态可以解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用事件运动先验指导变形场优化：1) 使用LoCM无监督微调框架从事件流中提取运动先验；2) 提出几何感知数据关联方法建立事件-高斯运动对应关系；3) 使用运动分解和帧间伪标签策略。

Result: 在合成和真实场景上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有的基于图像和事件的方法，证明事件数据可以有效优化动态3D高斯泼溅。

Conclusion: 通过结合RGB和事件模态，成功解决了动态3D高斯泼溅重建中的大帧间运动不确定性挑战，事件数据为优化过程提供了有效指导。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

TL;DR: 提出了GTR-Bench基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在地理时空推理方面的能力，特别是在大规模摄像头网络中追踪移动目标的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注自我中心视角的图像/视频推理或地理视角的图形推理，缺乏对图像/视频和图形上下文结合的地理时空智能评估，这在交通管理和应急响应等领域很重要。

Method: 构建GTR-Bench基准，要求模型在多摄像头网络中执行地理时空推理任务，需要在地图和视频之间进行多视角切换，跨多个非重叠视野视频进行联合推理，并对未被视频覆盖的时空区域进行推断。

Result: 评估了10多个流行VLM，发现即使是表现最好的专有模型Gemini-2.5-Pro（34.9%）也显著落后于人类表现（78.61%）。分析揭示了当前模型在地理时空推理中的三个主要缺陷。

Conclusion: GTR-Bench为时空智能研究提供了有价值的见解和新的机会，揭示了当前VLM在地理时空推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

Result: 在12个图像分类数据集上，ACAVP在视觉提示方法中达到最佳准确率，超越线性探测平均准确率，并表现出对分布偏移的更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ACAVP通过增强变换操作和有效数据增强，显著提升了视觉提示的性能，同时保持推理时的最小计算开销。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D

Conclusion: PrismGS是一个即插即用的框架，能够显著改善3D高斯溅射在大规模场景中的渲染质量，解决走样问题并提升稳定性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1

*Yijie Gao,Houqiang Zhong,Tianchi Zhu,Zhengxue Cheng,Qiang Hu,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignGS是一个新颖的3D重建框架，通过将语义理解作为几何正则化的主动引导力量，实现几何和语义的协同端到端优化，在稀疏视图下实现更准确和完整的3D室内场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将语义视为被动特征，在已形成的几何上绘制，而本文认为对于稀疏视图重建，语义理解应该成为主动的引导力量，以解决几何模糊性问题。

Method: 从2D基础模型中提取丰富先验，通过深度一致性和多面法线正则化等新颖的语义到几何引导机制，直接正则化3D表示。

Result: 在标准基准测试中实现了最先进的新视角合成效果，并产生具有优越几何精度的重建结果。

Conclusion: 利用语义先验作为几何正则化器，可以从有限的输入视图中获得更连贯和完整的3D模型。

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test
large amounts of compounds. A key component for such systems is the automated
evaluation via machine learning models. In this paper, we address critical
challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via
self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet
dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various
chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context
of the TOXBOX project.

*Haochen Yu,Qiankun Liu,Hongyuan Liu,Jianfei Jiang,Juntao Lyu,Jiansheng Chen,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZCylinder提出了一种基于统一圆柱体提升方法的feedforward模型，通过相机建模和特征提升来解决驾驶场景重建中的泛化能力和精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有feedforward重建方法在驾驶场景重建中存在两个主要问题：固定视角变换在相机配置变化时失效，限制了跨不同驾驶场景的泛化能力；稀疏360度全景视图间重叠区域小且驾驶场景复杂，增加了学习难度，降低了重建精度。

Method: 提出统一圆柱体相机建模(UCCM)策略避免学习视角依赖的空间对应关系，用可调参数统一不同相机配置；基于新设计的圆柱平面特征组(CPFG)提出混合表示和专用模块，将2D图像特征提升到3D空间。

Result: 实验结果显示XYZCylinder在不同评估设置下实现了最先进的性能，并能以零样本方式泛化到其他驾驶场景。

Conclusion: XYZCylinder通过统一的圆柱体提升方法有效解决了驾驶场景重建中的泛化能力和精度问题，在多种评估设置下表现出色。

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MARC方法，通过检索增强强化学习实现视频token压缩，仅用1帧token达到接近基线精度，减少95%视觉token、72%GPU内存和23.9%延迟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型扩展到视频时面临高计算成本问题，现有训练无关的token压缩方法会导致信息损失和性能下降

Method: 采用检索-压缩策略：视觉记忆检索器选择关键片段，压缩组相对策略优化框架将教师模型推理能力蒸馏到学生模型

Result: 在6个视频基准测试中，仅用1帧token实现接近基线精度，视觉token减少95%，GPU内存减少72%，延迟降低23.9%

Conclusion: MARC在资源受限场景下具有高效实时视频理解的潜力，适用于视频问答、监控和自动驾驶等应用

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,
and autonomous driving.

TL;DR: 提出了ASBench，首个专门评估异常合成方法的综合基准框架，包含四个关键评估维度，揭示了当前异常合成方法的局限性并提供了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测在制造业质量控制中很重要，但受限于异常样本稀少和标注成本高。异常合成是很有前景的解决方案，但现有研究缺乏对异常合成算法的系统评估，忽视了关键因素如与检测的脱钩影响、合成数据的定量分析和跨场景适应性。

Method: 提出ASBench基准框架，引入四个评估维度：不同数据集和管道的泛化性能、合成与真实数据的比例、合成图像内在指标与异常检测性能指标的相关性、混合异常合成方法的策略。

Result: 通过广泛实验，ASBench不仅揭示了当前异常合成方法的局限性，还为异常合成的未来研究方向提供了可行见解。

Conclusion: ASBench填补了异常合成方法系统评估的空白，为未来异常合成研究提供了重要的基准框架和指导方向。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

TL;DR: 提出TTOM框架，通过测试时优化和记忆机制，在推理过程中将视频基础模型的输出与时空布局对齐，提升文本-图像对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型在视觉生成方面表现出色，但在组合场景（如运动、数字和空间关系）中表现不佳，需要改进跨模态对齐能力。

Method: 采用训练免费框架，通过优化新参数和通用布局-注意力目标来对齐输出，并引入参数化记忆机制来维护历史优化上下文，支持插入、读取、更新和删除等操作。

Result: 在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试中，TTOM被证明是有效、实用、可扩展且高效的框架，能够实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐。

Conclusion: TTOM能够解耦组合性世界知识，展现出强大的可迁移性和泛化能力，为组合视频生成提供了有效的实时解决方案。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

Motivation: 随着自动驾驶发展，需要不仅能生成高保真控制视频，还能产生深度估计等多样化有意义信息的模型，以支持全面的场景理解。

Method: 首先通过辅助4D重建任务微调VAE，增强其3D结构和时间动态编码能力；然后将该VAE集成到视频扩散过程中提升生成质量；联合训练高斯泼溅解码器重建动态场景。

Result: 实验结果显示模型在FID和FVD指标上取得显著提升，高斯泼溅解码器能有效重建动态场景并提供几何信息。

Conclusion: CVD-STORM通过结合4D重建和视频生成，为自动驾驶提供了高质量的跨视角视频生成和几何信息重建能力。

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Motivation: 现有文本检测数据集主要针对自然或文档场景，而动漫场景中的文本具有风格多样、排列不规则、易与复杂视觉元素混淆等特点，现有数据集无法有效处理。

Method: 构建大规模动漫文本数据集AnimeText，包含分层标注和针对动漫场景的困难负样本，通过跨数据集基准测试验证其有效性。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用AnimeText训练的模型在动漫文本检测任务中优于使用现有数据集训练的模型。

Conclusion: AnimeText数据集填补了动漫场景文本检测的空白，为动漫文本检测研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection
tasks. AnimeText on HuggingFace:

Conclusion: 提出的SimCast和CasCast框架在不增加推理开销的情况下显著提升了降水临近预报的准确性，结合了确定性和概率模型的优势。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant

TL;DR: Latent Harmony是一个两阶段UHD图像恢复框架，通过联合正则化潜在空间和强制高频感知重建来重新定义VAE，在保持计算效率的同时恢复高频细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决UHD图像恢复中计算效率与高频细节保留之间的权衡问题。传统VAE的高斯约束会丢弃退化特定高频信息，影响重建保真度。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段LH-VAE通过视觉语义约束和渐进退化扰动增强语义鲁棒性，潜在等变性强化高频重建；第二阶段联合训练精炼VAE与恢复模型，使用高频低秩适应(HF-LoRA)恢复真实细节和合成逼真纹理。

Result: 在UHD和标准分辨率任务中实现了最先进的性能，有效平衡了效率、感知质量和重建精度。

Conclusion: Latent Harmony通过重新定义VAE的潜在空间正则化和高频感知重建，成功解决了UHD图像恢复中的效率-保真度权衡问题。

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哪种类型的标签更适合图像隐私这一上下文依赖且主观的任务，对象标签通常用于隐私分类，但抽象标签可能更有效。

Method: 比较对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类任务中的表现，分析不同标签数量下的效果差异。

Result: 当标签预算有限时，抽象标签比对象标签更有效；当标签数量充足时，对象标签信息同样有用。

Conclusion: 这些发现将指导未来研究开发更准确的图像隐私分类器，考虑标签类型和数量的作用。

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

Motivation: 解决低光图像恢复中高频细节恢复和严重噪声抑制的挑战，同时关注实际应用中计算效率的重要性。

Method: 通过实验比较最先进的SwinIR Transformer模型与标准轻量级CNN模型在低光图像恢复任务上的表现。

Result: SwinIR达到39.03 dB PSNR峰值性能，但轻量级CNN在仅10个训练周期后达到37.4 dB PSNR，且模型大小比SwinIR小55倍以上。

Conclusion: 标准CNN能以显著降低的计算开销提供接近SOTA的结果，在资源受限的实际场景中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

TL;DR: CIR-CoT是一个端到端的检索导向多模态大语言模型，通过显式的思维链推理来提升组合图像检索的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的组合图像检索方法（如基于CLIP和Qwen-VL的模型）作为"黑盒"系统，缺乏可解释性且难以遵循复杂的细粒度指令。

Method: 提出CIR-CoT模型，强制模型先生成可解释的推理链，然后将其最终检索意图编码到专用嵌入中。通过三阶段流程（标题、推理、结论）创建结构化思维链标注来训练模型。

Result: CIR-CoT在领域内数据集（FashionIQ、CIRR）上取得高度竞争力表现，在领域外CIRCO数据集上展现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CIR-CoT为构建更有效和可信的检索系统开辟了新路径，通过思维链推理实现了更好的跨模态交互理解和决策透明度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决相机感知系统因缺乏显式深度信息而难以生成准确3D目标检测预测的问题，缓解深度估计的模糊性。

Method: 提出基于射线的融合方法，利用合作者的射线占据信息来减少沿相机射线的冗余和误报预测。

Result: 综合实验表明该方法始终优于现有最先进模型，显著提升了协作视觉感知的性能。

Conclusion: RayFusion方法通过射线融合有效提升了纯相机协作感知系统的检测性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is
available at https://github.com/wangsh0111/RayFusion.

*Bheeshm Sharma,Karthikeyan Jaganathan,Balamurugan Palaniappan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RASALoRE：一种新颖的两阶段弱监督脑部MRI异常检测框架，通过区域感知空间注意力和基于位置的随机嵌入，在仅使用切片级标签的情况下实现高性能异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑部MRI扫描中弱监督异常检测的挑战，当精确的像素级标注不可用而只有弱标签（如切片级标签）可用时，需要快速准确地检测脑部异常。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用判别式双提示调优机制生成高质量的伪弱掩码；第二阶段使用带有区域感知空间注意力机制的分割网络，基于固定位置随机嵌入来聚焦异常区域。

Result: 在BraTS20、BraTS21、BraTS23和MSD数据集上实现了最先进的异常检测性能，显著优于现有WSAD方法，同时使用少于800万个参数，计算复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: RASALoRE框架在弱监督脑部MRI异常检测中表现出色，通过创新的两阶段设计和区域感知注意力机制，在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现了卓越性能。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RetouchLLM，一种无需训练的白盒图像润色系统，通过视觉评论家和代码生成器模块，直接在原始图像上执行可解释的代码级润色操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要大规模配对数据且作为黑盒运行，使得润色过程不透明，难以处理多样化的用户或图像特定调整。

Method: 采用训练免费的白盒方法，包含视觉评论家模块识别输入与参考图像差异，以及代码生成器模块产生可执行代码，以类似人类多步骤润色的方式渐进增强图像。

Result: 实验表明该方法能很好地泛化到不同润色风格，基于自然语言的用户交互实现了可解释和可控的调整，满足用户意图。

Conclusion: RetouchLLM提供了一种无需训练数据、可解释且可控的图像润色解决方案，能够处理多样化的调整需求。

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多时序类别驱动的分层残差神经网络，用于在不同语义级别对多光谱图像时间序列进行分类，通过引入分层惩罚映射和模块化架构提高分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多光谱图像时间序列分类中不同语义级别类别的区分问题，并利用有限训练样本有效训练模型，同时提高少数类别的表示能力。

Method: 修改ResNet架构，引入附加分支在不同层次级别进行分类，使用分层惩罚映射避免不连贯的层次转换，通过类别层次标签高效训练不同层级的网络。

Result: 在2019年亚马逊森林12个月Sentinel 2图像上的实验结果表明，该方法在不同层次级别具有良好的泛化能力，在微类别级别实现了准确分类，并更好地表示了少数类别。

Conclusion: 提出的模块化网络具有内在适应能力，通过微调可在新目标区域学习判别性特征，分层方法在提高微类别级别分类准确性方面表现出色。

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测的学术评估和基准测试缺乏针对性、多样性有限、技术受限，无法有效应对真实世界威胁，需要构建更贴近实际场景的数据集。

Method: 使用9个商业在线平台整合最新的深度伪造技术，通过定制算法合成多样化伪造内容，模拟真实黑盒场景，构建包含6万张图片和1000个视频的数据集。

Conclusion: RedFace数据集成功弥合了学术评估与真实需求之间的差距，为深度伪造检测研究提供了更贴近实际场景的基准测试平台。

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace
dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared
to conventional datasets. Our dataset is available at:

Motivation: AI生成视频已达到近乎完美的视觉真实感，急需可靠的检测机制，但面临高维时空动态建模和识别违反物理规律的细微异常的挑战。

Method: 提出归一化时空梯度统计量，利用预训练扩散模型开发NSG估计器，通过空间梯度近似和运动感知时序建模，无需复杂运动分解，然后基于NSG特征计算MMD距离作为检测指标。

Result: 实验表明NSG-VD在召回率和F1分数上分别比最先进基线方法提升16.00%和10.75%，验证了其优越性能。

Conclusion: NSG-VD通过物理驱动的检测范式有效识别AI生成视频，为视频真实性验证提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

TL;DR: DarkHash是首个针对深度哈希的无数据后门攻击方法，通过双语义引导的阴影后门攻击框架，仅使用替代数据集微调特定层来植入后门，同时保持原始检索精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度哈希后门攻击需要访问训练数据，但在现实世界中由于隐私保护和知识产权问题往往无法获取。因此需要开发无需训练数据即可植入后门的攻击方法。

Method: 提出双语义引导的阴影后门攻击框架，通过拓扑对齐损失优化个体和相邻中毒样本向目标样本对齐，仅使用替代数据集微调受害者模型的特定层。

Result: 在四个图像数据集、五种模型架构和两种哈希方法上的实验表明，DarkHash具有高有效性，优于现有最先进的后门攻击方法，并能抵御主流后门防御方法。

Conclusion: DarkHash成功实现了无需训练数据的深度哈希后门攻击，在保持原始检索精度的同时实现了强大的攻击能力，对深度哈希模型的安全性提出了新的挑战。

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端视角下人脸解析因标注数据有限而面临的挑战，避免昂贵且难以规模化的人工标注。

Method: 联合拟合两个3DGS模型（一个用于RGB图像，一个用于初始分割图），通过共享几何结构强制多视图一致性，仅需少量后处理即可合成姿态多样的训练数据。

Result: 在精炼数据集上微调的人脸解析模型在挑战性头部姿态上显著提升准确性，同时在标准视图上保持强性能，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需真实3D标注且仅使用少量初始图像，为提升现实场景中人脸解析鲁棒性提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.

Motivation: 在医学影像分析中，深度学习模型需要图像增强来实现泛化能力。然而，将自然图像的增强方法直接应用于CT图像会忽视HU强度的物理意义，导致伪影和泛化能力差。

Method: 提出随机窗口化增强技术，该方法利用CT图像中HU强度的分布特性，通过随机调整窗口设置来增强模型对对比度变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在肝肿瘤分割任务中优于现有最先进方法，特别是在对比度差或时间不佳的图像上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 随机窗口化是一种有效的CT特定增强技术，能够提高深度学习模型在医学影像分割任务中的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: AR-Drag是第一个RL增强的少步自回归视频扩散模型，成功解决了实时运动可控视频生成的延迟和质量问题。

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生自相矛盾的输出，严重影响其可靠性。在视频语言模型中，这种现象尤为突出，模型无法基于其基础输出对重述问题提供逻辑一致的响应，但其根本原因尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用可解释性驱动的方法分析、统计总结并干预该现象。提出TCAS方法，基于注意力差异构建增强目标，通过提高模型的时间分辨能力来改善其时间理解逻辑一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了视频语言模型的时间逻辑一致性。可解释性分析证实该方法确实改善了注意力头的时间辨别能力。此外，在通用视频时间定位任务中也取得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 时间逻辑一致性是时间理解的瓶颈，通过增强一致性，该方法推动了视频时间理解的显著进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Conclusion: UniMMVSR成功解决了多模态条件利用的挑战，为高质量视频生成提供了新的解决方案，实现了以前技术无法达到的4K视频多模态引导生成能力。

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

Conclusion: MURE框架通过多模态链式推理有效解决了复杂图像编辑中的推理挑战，MMDC机制确保了高质量推理轨迹，为图像编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,

*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种用于细粒度视觉分类的引导式规范化方法，通过迭代重对齐训练样本来减少几何偏差，无需依赖对齐假设或昂贵的数据增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类任务需要处理几何偏差和噪声，现有方法依赖数据增强或等变架构，但前者需要强大模型，后者限制表达能力且成本高。规范化方法假设训练数据对齐，但现实数据集无法满足此假设。

Method: 提出引导式规范化算法，通过迭代重对齐训练样本，逐步减少方差并恢复对齐假设。算法在任意紧致群下具有收敛保证。

Result: 在四个细粒度视觉分类基准测试中，该方法一致优于等变和规范化基线方法，与数据增强方法性能相当。

Conclusion: 引导式规范化提供了一种有效的替代方案，能够在细粒度视觉分类中处理几何偏差，无需依赖对齐假设或昂贵的数据增强。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

*Haoran Yu,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructUDrag是一个结合文本指令和对象拖拽的扩散模型框架，能够同时进行精确的对象移动和基于文本的图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本编辑方法难以精确定位对象，而对象拖拽方法仅限于静态重定位，需要一种能同时解决这两个问题的方法。

Method: 将对象拖拽视为图像重建过程，分为两个协同分支：移动重建分支使用基于能量的梯度引导精确移动对象，文本驱动编辑分支共享梯度信号实现一致变换，同时采用DDPM反演和先验信息注入来保持对象结构。

Result: 实验表明InstructUDrag能够实现灵活、高保真的图像编辑，在对象重定位精度和图像内容语义控制方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了文本指令和对象拖拽的优势，为图像编辑提供了更精确和灵活的控制能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FineDual方法，通过三阶段建模动态层次化的人体交互，从个体到交互个体再到整体运动，生成精细化的双人运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模人体交互时通常忽略距离和层次性，而人类交互本质上是动态和层次化的，需要同时考虑运动随距离的变化以及从个体到交互个体再到整体的层次结构。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 自学习阶段：使用大语言模型将双人整体文本分解为个体文本，在个体层面对齐文本和运动特征；2) 自适应调整阶段：通过交互距离预测器预测交互距离，使用交互感知图网络在交互个体层面动态建模人体交互；3) 教师引导精炼阶段：利用整体文本特征作为指导，在整体层面精炼运动特征。

Result: 在双人运动数据集上的大量定量和定性评估表明，FineDual优于现有方法，能够有效建模动态层次化的人体交互。

Conclusion: FineDual方法通过建模动态层次化交互，能够生成精细化和高质量的双人运动，解决了现有方法忽略距离和层次性的问题。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

*Chenying Liu,Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AdaGC框架，用于遥感图像的单正例多标签学习，通过自适应梯度校准机制解决标注不完整问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像的多标签分类比单标签分类能提供更全面的语义理解，但完整标注成本高昂。单正例多标签学习作为实用替代方案，虽然可扩展但存在显著的监督模糊性，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 提出自适应梯度校准(AdaGC)框架，包含梯度校准机制、Mixup和数据增强、双EMA模块用于生成鲁棒伪标签，以及基于训练动态的自适应触发机制。

Result: 在两个基准遥感数据集上的广泛实验表明，AdaGC在两种不同标签噪声类型下均实现了最先进的性能，并在多样化设置中保持了强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaGC是一个新颖且可泛化的SPML框架，通过自适应梯度校准有效缓解标签噪声的过拟合问题，在遥感图像多标签分类中表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

*Haipeng Liu,Yang Wang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NTN-Diff方法，通过频率感知的扩散模型解决文本引导图像修复中的语义一致性和未掩码区域保护问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时解决未掩码区域保护和掩码/未掩码区域语义一致性这两个挑战，这源于不同频率带在去噪过程中对文本提示的不同鲁棒性

Method: 将去噪过程分为早期和晚期阶段，在早期阶段通过文本引导去噪稳定中频带，然后使用零文本去噪处理低频带，最后在晚期阶段进行文本引导去噪

Result: 广泛的实验验证了NTN-Diff在文本引导扩散模型中的优越性

Conclusion: NTN-Diff通过频率分解和分阶段去噪策略，成功解决了文本引导图像修复中的关键挑战

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，实现了更准确可靠的指称检测

Conclusion: 提出的ERU框架能够有效处理复杂或杂乱环境中的指称理解任务，提高歧义场景下的目标识别能力

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and
reliable referent detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经场景表示方法在包含强烈曝光变化的数据（如室内外混合场景或带窗户的房间）中表现不佳，输出质量会下降。

Method: 学习一个预测每个3D点最佳曝光值的神经场，通过新颖的神经调节机制联合优化场景表示和曝光场。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现最先进的结果，比最佳基线方法提升超过55%，训练速度更快。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在高动态范围场景中实现准确的视图合成，无需后处理步骤或多曝光捕获。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种有效的长程时序上下文注意力机制（LTCA），通过堆叠稀疏局部注意力和全局查询交互来平衡局部性和全局性，在四个参考视频分割基准上实现了新的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决参考视频分割中长程时序上下文信息提取的问题。现有方法要么使用所有帧的注意力，要么堆叠密集局部注意力，但无法在局部性和全局性之间取得良好平衡，且计算复杂度随视频长度显著增加。

Method: 提出LTCA机制：1）堆叠稀疏局部注意力，使用扩张窗口注意力聚合局部上下文信息，并通过层堆叠实现全局视图；2）每个查询关注从全局池中随机选择的一小组键以增强全局性；3）设计全局查询与所有其他查询交互以直接编码全局上下文信息。

Result: 在四个参考视频分割基准上实现了新的最先进性能，在MeViS valu和val数据集上分别提升了11.3%和8.3%。

Conclusion: LTCA机制有效平衡了局部性和全局性，显著提升了参考视频分割的性能，同时降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义基础的学习范式，通过跨模态亲和力转移将2D视觉基础模型的丰富语义知识迁移到3D领域，用于3D功能分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 通过将2D视觉基础模型的语义知识迁移到3D领域，能够有效解决3D功能分割中的语义一致性问题，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型的计算成本随序列长度呈二次方增长，而完全替换为线性注意力需要昂贵的预训练。需要一种方法在不损失性能的情况下降低计算复杂度。

Method: 提出选择性迁移方法，将层选择视为二分类问题，自动渐进式地将层转换为线性注意力；引入任意时间分布匹配目标，在采样轨迹的任何时间步对齐样本分布。

Conclusion: LinVideo框架有效解决了视频扩散模型的计算效率问题，通过智能层选择和分布匹配实现了显著的加速效果。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

### [81] [Detecting Legend Items on Historical Maps Using GPT-4o with In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08385)
*Sofia Kirsanova,Yao-Yi Chiang,Weiwei Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LayoutLMv3和GPT-4o的方法，用于自动检测和链接历史地图图例中的符号及其描述，通过边界框预测实现结构化解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图图例对于解释制图符号至关重要，但其不一致的布局和非结构化格式使得自动提取具有挑战性。现有方法主要关注分割或通用OCR，很少有方法能有效匹配图例符号与其描述。

Method: 使用LayoutLMv3进行布局检测，结合GPT-4o通过上下文学习来检测和链接图例项及其描述，利用边界框预测实现结构化匹配。

Result: 实验显示GPT-4配合结构化JSON提示优于基线，达到88% F-1分数和85% IoU，并揭示了提示设计、示例数量和布局对齐对性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法支持可扩展的、布局感知的图例解析，提高了各种视觉风格历史地图的索引和可搜索性。

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various
visual styles.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于课程学习的源自由域适应框架LFC，通过易到难和源到目标两种课程设计，在无需源数据的情况下实现医学图像的域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像数据隐私和安全问题，现有源自由域适应方法主要关注伪标签细化而忽略了学习过程，渐进式学习过程有利于知识迁移。

Method: 提出LFC框架，包含易到难课程（从简单样本开始学习，逐步增加样本难度调整优化方向）和源到目标课程（确保从源域到目标域的平滑迁移）。

Result: 在眼底分割和息肉分割的跨域数据集上评估，实验结果表明该方法超越了现有方法，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: LFC框架通过课程学习策略有效解决了源自由域适应问题，在保护数据隐私的同时实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: VideoVerse是一个新的文本到视频生成基准测试，专注于评估模型对现实世界中复杂时间因果性和世界知识的理解能力，包含300个精心策划的提示和793个二元评估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法充分评估最先进的文本到视频模型，缺乏对事件级时间因果性和世界知识的系统性评估，而这些是构建世界模型的关键能力。

Method: 收集跨多个领域的代表性视频，提取具有内在时间因果性的事件级描述，由独立注释者重写为文本到视频提示，设计包含10个评估维度的二元评估问题，并开发基于现代视觉语言模型的人类偏好对齐QA评估流程。

Result: VideoVerse包含300个提示、815个事件和793个评估问题，对开源和闭源的最先进T2V模型进行了系统性评估。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为评估T2V模型是否具备世界模型能力提供了全面框架，揭示了当前T2V生成器与世界模型之间的差距。

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

### [84] [Large Scale Diffusion Distillation via Score-Regularized Continuous-Time Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08431)
*Kaiwen Zheng,Yuji Wang,Qianli Ma,Huayu Chen,Jintao Zhang,Yogesh Balaji,Jianfei Chen,Ming-Yu Liu,Jun Zhu,Qinsheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次将连续时间一致性蒸馏扩展到通用应用级图像和视频扩散模型，提出了分数正则化连续时间一致性模型(rCM)，解决了sCM在细节生成上的质量限制，在140亿参数模型和5秒视频任务上实现了1-4步高质量生成，加速扩散采样15-50倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然连续时间一致性模型(sCM)在学术规模扩散加速中表现优异，但其在大规模文本到图像和视频任务中的适用性仍不明确，主要面临Jacobian-vector乘积计算的基础设施挑战和标准评估基准的局限性。

Method: 开发了并行兼容的FlashAttention-2 JVP核，支持超过100亿参数模型的sCM训练；提出分数正则化连续时间一致性模型(rCM)，通过分数蒸馏作为长跳跃正则器，结合sCM的前向散度和反向散度的模式寻求特性。

Result: 在Cosmos-Predict2、Wan2.1等高达140亿参数模型和5秒视频任务上，rCM在质量指标上匹配或超越最先进的蒸馏方法DMD2，同时在多样性方面具有显著优势，无需GAN调优或大量超参数搜索。

Conclusion: rCM作为一个实用且理论基础的框架，推动了大规模扩散蒸馏的发展，能够在仅1-4步内生成高保真样本，实现15-50倍的扩散采样加速。

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

*Andrew Lee,Ian Chuang,Dechen Gao,Kai Fukazawa,Iman Soltani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Gaze on the Prize框架，通过可学习的中央凹注意力机制改进视觉强化学习，利用回报差异指导注意力聚焦任务相关特征，显著提高样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉RL代理需要处理高维图像数据，但只有少量像素与任务相关，导致探索和计算资源浪费，学习效率低下且不稳定。

Method: 引入可学习的中央凹注意力机制，通过回报引导的对比学习训练注意力：基于回报差异将相似视觉表示分组为正负样本，构建对比三元组来训练注意力机制区分不同结果的状态。

Result: 在ManiSkill3基准测试中，样本效率提高达2.4倍，能解决基线方法无法学习的任务，且无需修改底层算法或超参数。

Conclusion: 基于回报差异的注意力机制能有效识别任务相关特征，显著提升视觉RL的性能和样本效率。

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个综合的图像处理框架，能够处理从基础量化到高级特征提取的多种任务，满足实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的需求。

Method: 采用模块化设计，包括灰度量化、RGB/YCrCb色彩空间直方图均衡、HSV亮度调整、3×3卷积核锐化、双向变换管道（包含反锐化掩模、伽马校正和噪声放大），以及Canny边缘检测、Hough线估计、Harris角点检测等几何特征提取方法。

Result: 双向变换管道准确率达到76.10%（正向）和74.80%（反向）；Hough线估计角度精度51.50°；球杆隔离相似度81.87%；在多样化数据集上表现出稳健和确定性性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在图像处理和分析任务中表现出色，具有实时应用的潜力，为计算机视觉系统提供了可靠的工具集。

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

TL;DR: Video-STAR是一个用于开放词汇动作识别的框架，通过子动作分解和工具增强强化学习来解决多模态大语言模型在语义相似动作区分上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖文本先验，在开放词汇场景中难以区分语义相似的动作，需要更细粒度的视觉推理能力。

Method: 将动作分解为可区分的子动作进行细粒度匹配，同时动态调用领域特定工具进行跨模态交织，通过分层奖励机制平衡工具使用效率、子动作相关性和推理结构连贯性。

Result: 在HMDB-51、UCF-101、SSv2、Kinetics-400和Kinetics-600数据集上达到最先进性能，在区分细粒度动作和处理跨模态幻觉方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Video-STAR通过子动作分解和工具增强强化学习，有效提升了开放词汇动作识别的性能，减少了跨模态幻觉，具有良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了视觉象似性挑战基准，评估视觉语言模型在手语象似性任务上的表现，发现模型在语音形式预测和透明度任务上表现低于人类，但在象似性评分上与人类有中等相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语中的象似性（语言形式与意义的相似性）为视觉基础提供了自然测试平台，需要评估VLMs从动态人体运动中恢复这种基本映射的能力。

Method: 引入视觉象似性挑战基准，包含三个任务：语音符号形式预测（手形、位置）、透明度（从视觉形式推断意义）和分级象似性评分，在零样本和少样本设置下评估13个最先进的VLMs。

Result: 在语音形式预测任务中，VLMs能恢复部分手形和位置细节但仍低于人类表现；在透明度任务中远低于人类基线；只有顶级模型与人类象似性评分有中等相关性。有趣的是，语音形式预测能力更强的模型与人类象似性判断相关性更好。

Conclusion: 验证了这些诊断任务的有效性，并激励采用以人为本的信号和具身学习方法，以建模象似性并改进多模态模型中的视觉基础。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM中的注意力汇点，而忽视了ViT视觉编码器中同样重要的高范数视觉标记。这些ViT注意力汇点包含关键语义信息，但当前LVLM架构未能充分利用。

Method: 提出定性和定量分析ViT汇点标记中的信息，并开发了免训练和基于训练的方法来更好地利用这些信息。

Result: 通过显式利用ViT注意力汇点标记，在各种LVLM和视觉推理任务上实现了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: ViT注意力汇点在增强视觉推理方面具有巨大潜力，应被更充分地利用。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在局限，主要原因是缺乏从感知到理解的层级基础，直接学习空间推理效果不佳。

Method: 构建SpatialLadder-26k多模态数据集，采用三阶段渐进训练框架：空间感知（目标定位）、空间理解（多维空间任务）、复杂推理（可验证奖励的强化学习）。

Result: SpatialLadder模型在空间推理基准上平均提升23.4%，在域外基准上提升7.2%，展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 从感知到推理的渐进式训练对于构建稳健的空间智能至关重要。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first

\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

*Rishubh Parihar,Or Patashnik,Daniil Ostashev,R. Venkatesh Babu,Daniel Cohen-Or,Kuan-Chieh Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kontinuous Kontext是一个指令驱动的图像编辑模型，通过添加标量编辑强度参数，使用户能够从无变化到完全实现结果的连续范围内精细控制编辑程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仅依赖文本指令限制了图像编辑的精细控制程度，需要一种能够连续调整编辑强度的解决方案。

Method: 扩展现有图像编辑模型，添加标量编辑强度输入，训练轻量级投影网络将标量和编辑指令映射到模型的调制空间系数，使用生成模型合成多样化训练数据集。

Result: 模型能够在风格化、属性、材质、背景和形状变化等多种操作中提供从细微到强烈的连续编辑控制，无需特定属性训练。

Conclusion: Kontinuous Kontext为指令驱动的图像编辑提供了统一的精细控制方法，实现了编辑强度的连续可调。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoNorms是一个包含1000多个视频片段-规范对的文化意识基准数据集，用于评估视频大语言模型在不同文化背景下的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频大语言模型在全球部署，需要评估其对相关文化背景的理解和基础能力，但目前缺乏合适的基准测试工具。

Method: 采用人机协作框架构建数据集：使用基于理论提示的教师模型生成候选标注，由训练有素的人类专家验证和修正标注。数据集包含美中文化背景的视频片段，标注了基于言语行为理论的社会文化规范、规范遵守/违反标签以及言语和非言语证据。

Result: 对多种开源视频大语言模型的测试发现：1) 模型在规范违反检测上表现较差；2) 对中国文化的理解不如美国文化；3) 提供非言语证据比言语证据更困难；4) 在正式、非幽默语境中表现不如人类。

Conclusion: 研究强调了文化基础视频语言模型训练的必要性，VideoNorms基准和框架为此提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

TL;DR: 提出基于语义场景图的深度压缩框架，将点云分解为语义一致的分块，使用FiLM条件编码器压缩，通过折叠解码器重建，在保持语义和结构保真度下实现98%的数据压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云数据在带宽受限和间歇连接环境下的高效传输问题，满足多机器人系统中边缘和云端处理的需求。

Method: 使用语义场景图分解点云为语义分块，采用FiLM条件编码器生成紧凑潜在表示，通过基于折叠的解码器进行结构精确重建。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和nuScenes数据集上实现最先进的压缩率，数据大小减少达98%，同时保持结构和语义保真度，支持下游应用如多机器人位姿图优化和地图融合。

Conclusion: 该框架为带宽受限环境下的3D点云传输提供了高效解决方案，在保持数据质量的同时显著减少传输量，支持实际机器人应用。

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

*Yunzhe Xu,Yiyuan Pan,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memoir提出了一种基于想象力的记忆检索机制，通过世界模型想象未来导航状态作为查询，选择性检索环境观察和行为历史，在记忆持久性视觉语言导航任务中取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆持久性VLN方法存在关键限制：缺乏有效的记忆访问机制，依赖完整记忆整合或固定时间窗口查找；主要存储环境观察而忽略编码有价值决策策略的导航行为模式。

Method: 1) 语言条件世界模型想象未来状态，用于编码经验和生成检索查询；2) 混合视角级记忆，将观察和行为模式锚定到视角，支持混合检索；3) 经验增强导航模型，通过专用编码器整合检索知识。

Result: 在10个不同测试场景的多样化记忆持久性VLN基准上，Memoir在所有场景中均有显著改进：在IR2R上比最佳记忆持久性基线提升5.4% SPL，同时实现8.3倍训练加速和74%推理内存减少。

Conclusion: 预测性检索环境和行为记忆可实现更有效的导航，分析表明这种想象力引导范式具有巨大提升空间（73.3% vs 93.4%上限）。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个理论框架解释为什么在预训练模型中对随机选择的小子网络进行微调就能实现下游任务适应，并基于此提出了SliceFine方法，该方法无需引入新参数，在性能相当的情况下显著提升了训练速度、内存效率和模型紧凑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为参数高效微调（PEFT）提供理论依据，解释为什么仅微调预训练模型中的小子网络就能获得良好性能，从而减少计算和内存开销。

Method: 提出Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis理论框架，基于谱平衡和任务能量两个现象。在此基础上开发SliceFine方法，仅更新原始权重中的选定切片，不引入新参数。

Result: SliceFine在语言和视觉任务上达到了最先进PEFT方法的性能，同时显著提升了训练速度、内存效率和模型紧凑性。

Conclusion: 该工作连接了理论与实践，为现有PEFT技术提供了理论支撑的替代方案，证明了利用预训练模型内在冗余性的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像到视频生成方法在轨迹控制方面存在局限性，需要更灵活、多粒度的轨迹控制能力，同时提高训练效率和推理性能。

Method: 引入统一的点轨迹表示（分割ID、轨迹ID、颜色通道），采用序列拼接方案而非传统条件注入方法，并使用退火训练策略逐步减少对完整监督的依赖。

Result: 实验结果表明FlexTraj能够实现多粒度、对齐无关的轨迹控制，支持运动克隆、拖拽式图像到视频、运动插值、相机重定向等多种应用。

Conclusion: FlexTraj提供了一个高效灵活的轨迹控制框架，在保持鲁棒性的同时实现了更强的可控性和更快的收敛速度。

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

Motivation: 解决单目图像序列实时3D重建的挑战，现有方法存在保真度与效率的权衡：逐场景优化计算昂贵，前馈基础模型实时但精度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 使用3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，结合高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，设计分层高斯表示和LoD感知渲染策略以提高保真度和减少冗余。

Conclusion: ARTDECO为实时数字化真实世界环境提供了实用路径，兼具准确几何和高视觉保真度。

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代潜在视频扩散模型存在时间模糊性问题，因果VAE将多个像素帧压缩到单一潜在表示中，使得精确的帧级控制变得困难。

Method: 采用混合条件策略，通过零填充处理空间放置，通过时间RoPE插值为每个条件分配连续分数位置，解决VAE的时间模糊性。

Result: VideoCanvas显著优于现有条件范式，在灵活统一的视频生成方面建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: VideoCanvas框架成功解决了潜在视频扩散模型中的时间模糊性问题，实现了像素帧感知的精确控制。

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

Conclusion: ResAD通过残差轨迹建模和点向归一化有效解决了端到端自动驾驶中的时空不平衡问题，提高了模型性能和安全性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的端到端原生训练方法，提出了NaViL模型，在14个多模态基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLM通常采用组合式训练范式，将预训练视觉编码器与预训练LLM连接进行多模态预训练。但这种分离训练方式难以探索多模态缩放特性。

Method: 系统研究端到端原生MLLM的设计空间和缩放特性，在数据约束的实际设置下，探索视觉编码器与LLM之间的最优组合，提出NaViL模型和简单高效训练方案。

Result: 实验结果表明NaViL在14个多模态基准测试中具有竞争力，发现视觉编码器与LLM之间存在正相关的缩放关系。

Conclusion: 原生MLLM训练方法可行且有效，为未来研究提供了深入见解，证明了端到端训练在多模态任务中的优势。

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了D²GS框架解决稀疏视图下3D高斯泼溅的过拟合和欠拟合问题，通过深度密度引导的dropout策略和距离感知保真度增强模块提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在稀疏视图条件下存在性能下降和不稳定性问题，主要由于相机附近高斯密度过高导致过拟合，以及远处区域高斯覆盖不足导致欠拟合。

Method: D²GS框架包含两个核心组件：深度密度引导的dropout策略，基于密度和深度自适应掩码冗余高斯；距离感知保真度增强模块，通过针对性监督改善远场区域重建质量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在稀疏视图条件下显著提升了视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的D²GS框架有效解决了稀疏视图3D高斯泼溅的过拟合和欠拟合问题，并引入了新的评估指标来量化高斯分布的稳定性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: ReSplat是一种前馈循环高斯溅射模型，通过迭代优化3D高斯而不显式计算梯度，利用渲染误差作为反馈信号，在减少高斯数量和提升渲染速度的同时实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统前馈高斯溅射模型依赖单次前向推理，性能受限。需要一种能够迭代优化3D高斯的方法，同时保持计算效率。

Method: 提出循环高斯溅射模型，使用渲染误差作为反馈信号指导高斯更新；引入紧凑重建模型在16倍下采样空间初始化，减少高斯数量；支持不同输入视图、分辨率和数据集。

Result: 在DL3DV和RealEstate10K数据集上，使用2、8、16个输入视图，分辨率从256×256到540×960，实现了最先进性能，显著减少高斯数量并提升渲染速度。

Conclusion: ReSplat通过循环优化机制有效提升了高斯溅射模型的性能，在保持计算效率的同时实现了更好的泛化能力和渲染质量。

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大规模经验模型与形式验证相结合，解决神经语言生成中的幻觉问题，确保生成内容与知识库的一致性。

Method: 基于概率程序语义的约束语义学，在解码时引入语义防护格，使用知识感知的安全质量量化事实风险，并采用多智能体操作演算进行实现验证。

Result: TAD 在减少幻觉的同时不牺牲吞吐量，贪婪选择在健全和完整防护下具有局部似然优势，通过 Lean 工具验证实现行为。

Conclusion: TAD 为大规模经验模型和形式验证之间提供了实用的桥梁，通过解码时语义防护有效减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工作通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，但作者认为这会导致智能体沦为无意识的策略遵循机器人，无法实现真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知。

Method: 通过形式化分析，证明隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料不同，从而产生稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略。发射是双层的，包含认知内容。

Result: 建立了LLM自我意识的最小条件，证明了隐藏状态流形的独特性，并提出了包含自我模型的自我策略公式。

Conclusion: imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前体，人类是最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L2M-AID是一个基于LLM增强的多智能体强化学习的自主工业防御框架，通过融合LLM的语义理解能力和MARL的协作学习，显著提升了工业物联网的安全防护能力。


<details>

Motivation: 工业物联网的普及使关键网络物理系统面临传统防御难以应对的多阶段复杂攻击，需要具备上下文感知能力的自适应安全解决方案。

Method: 使用LLM作为语义桥梁将非结构化遥测数据转换为上下文状态表示，结合多智能体强化学习算法MAPPO学习协作防御策略，奖励函数平衡安全目标和操作稳定性。

Result: 在SWaT基准数据集和基于MITRE ATT&CK ICS框架的合成数据集上，L2M-AID实现了97.2%的检测率，误报率降低80%以上，响应时间提升4倍，同时保持物理过程稳定性。

Conclusion: L2M-AID为关键国家基础设施安全提供了一个强大的新范式，通过深度融合LLM和MARL实现了上下文感知的自适应工业防御。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

Motivation: 探究思考模型性能提升的本质：是学习全新推理能力，还是重新利用基础模型已有能力。

Method: 提出混合模型，在基础模型中适时激活推理机制；引入无监督、自下而上的方法揭示思考模型的人类可解释推理行为。

Result: 在三个基础模型和四个思考模型上，混合模型无需权重更新即可恢复高达91%的性能差距，且仅需引导12%的token。

Conclusion: 预训练阶段模型已获得大部分推理机制，后训练阶段教会模型在适当时间高效部署这些机制，实现推理计算的高效利用。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维需求，当前心理健康诊断评估存在容量限制，需要更个性化和持续的关注。

Method: 使用生成式AI进行频繁、低水平的经验采样，促进诊断协调，并引入心理健康数字孪生(MHDTs)作为个性化护理框架。

Result: AI能够实现连续、丰富、以患者为中心的数据采样，动态适应个体需求和变化条件。

Conclusion: 这种AI驱动的连续评估框架有望提高心理健康治疗的可及性和有效性，需要进一步研究来完善和实施该框架。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

Conclusion: ProSEA有潜力成为更透明、自适应和与人类对齐的AI智能体的基础框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

Motivation: 现有交通预测模型如TESTAM缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的显式整合，限制了其空间建模能力。

Method: 提出TESTAM+框架，引入新型SpatioSemantic专家，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动特征相似性相结合。

Result: 在METR LA上MAE降低1.3%(3.10 vs 3.14)，PEMS BAY上提升4.1%(1.65 vs 1.72)。最优配置相比MegaCRN在METR LA上MAE降低11.5%(2.99 vs 3.38)，推理延迟比完整四专家TESTAM+减少53.1%。

Conclusion: 更少但战略设计的专家优于复杂的多专家集成，在实现最先进性能的同时具有更好的计算效率，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

Motivation: 现有LLM在时间序列推理任务中表现不佳，存在幻觉和知识泄漏问题，需要专门设计来解决这些挑战。

Method: 使用LLM进行证据收集和推理合成，同时用时间序列分析工具提取统计和结构信息，通过原子操作符与原始数值序列交互，并采用自我批评和最终质量门控机制迭代优化推理过程。

Result: 在理解基准测试中与最先进LLM性能相当，在推理任务上显著改进，特别是在零样本设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过分离LLM推理能力和时间序列分析，避免了多模态对齐训练，保持了时间序列的原始形式，确保了可解释性和可验证性，有效缓解了知识泄漏和幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to

TL;DR: 该论文研究医疗智能系统的伦理风险优化问题，通过数学建模比较MIP、SAT和CP三种求解方法的性能，旨在支持符合可信AI伦理要求的风险管理流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗智能系统被欧盟AI法案列为高风险系统，需要正式的风险管理流程来确保符合可信AI的伦理要求，因此需要优化风险降低方案。

Method: 将风险降低优化问题形式化为约束优化任务，使用Minizinc约束建模语言建模，并比较混合整数规划、可满足性和约束编程三种求解方法。

Result: 通过实验研究分析了三种方法的性能、表达能力和可扩展性，识别了方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 从方法论的局限性出发，提出了将Minizinc模型整合到完整的可信AI伦理风险管理流程中的未来工作展望。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

*Md. Nazmul Islam Ananto,Shamit Fatin,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于从历史轨迹数据中发现热门路径，通过搜索和生成两阶段流程实现，无需模型训练即可处理地理空间问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统热门路径查询方法需要模型训练、参数调整和数据更新时的重新训练，而大语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出强大能力，因此探索如何将其应用于地理空间问题具有重要意义。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含两个阶段：SEARCH阶段识别现有热门路径，GENERATE阶段在历史数据中不存在路径时合成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出优越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力，同时成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功将大语言模型的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为热门路径查询提供了一种无需训练的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for
privacy compliance but remains challenging in low-resource languages due to
linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. We present RECAP, a hybrid
framework that combines deterministic regular expressions with context-aware
large language models (LLMs) for scalable PII detection across 13 low-resource

Motivation: AI领域快速发展但缺乏可信评估标准，当前基准测试存在数据污染、选择性报告等问题，影响了科学信号的清晰度和公众信任，需要像人类考试那样建立公平可信的评估体系。

Method: 提出PeerBench框架，采用社区治理、密封执行、题库滚动更新和延迟透明等机制，构建一个统一、实时、质量可控的基准测试蓝图。

Result: 通过分析当前AI评估的系统性缺陷，提炼出新一代评估的基本要求，并设计了PeerBench这一社区治理的监考评估方案。

Conclusion: 当前放任自流的AI评估方式不可持续，需要向统一、质量可控的基准测试范式转变，PeerBench为实现可信AI进展评估提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级即插即用的澄清模块，通过插入必要问题来阻止多智能体系统中错误传播，显著提升准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持低开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统通过分工协作有望增强问题解决能力，但经常因边缘级错误级联（微小不准确在消息传递中传播）而表现不如单智能体基线。

Method: AgentAsk采用三阶段流程：(i)从失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略，(ii)监督策略决定何时/问什么/问谁/如何问，(iii)使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编程基准测试中，AgentAsk持续提升公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持最小开销，延迟和额外成本均低于5%，接近强评估器性能。

Conclusion: 除了经验改进外，本文贡献了边缘级错误的分类原则和链路局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的顺序多智能体系统虽然能自动化复杂软件任务，但由于错误在阶段间悄无声息地传递，导致系统难以信任。需要建立可追溯和问责的管道系统。

Method: 采用Planner -> Executor -> Critic管道架构，评估了8种配置的三种先进LLM在三个基准测试上的表现，分析错误起源、传播和修复机制。

Result: 研究发现：(1)添加结构化问责交接显著提高准确性，防止简单管道中的常见故障；(2)模型具有明确的角色特定优势和风险；(3)准确性-成本-延迟权衡是任务依赖的，异构管道通常最有效。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的、数据驱动的方法，用于设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测和可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

Motivation: 前沿AI模型在组合推理基准上表现不佳，但研究发现这是由于评估指标的系统性低估导致的，需要更准确的评估方法和性能提升技术。

Method: 引入组匹配分数来更好地利用组结构，并提出测试时匹配(TTM)算法——一种无需外部监督的迭代自改进方法。

Result: SigLIP-B16超越所有先前结果和GPT-4，GPT-4.1在Winoground上首次超越估计的人类性能；TTM使SigLIP-B16在MMVP-VLM上超越GPT-4.1，在16个数据集上实现一致改进。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估方法和测试时匹配技术，可以显著提升模型的组合推理能力，缩小与人类性能的差距。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

Motivation: 现实推荐系统中新物品频繁添加，现有离线策略学习方法在存在新物品时可能不安全，需要开发能保证安全性的探索框架

Method: 首先开发Safe OPG方法（基于高置信度离线策略评估的模型无关安全OPL方法），然后提出DEPL框架（利用安全边际并在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化）

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；DEPL框架能在保证安全的同时有效探索新物品

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够在保证推荐系统安全实施的同时，实现对新颖物品的探索

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

Result: 实验显示智能体仅能达到55%的不安全计划修正成功率，在三种模型（Claude、GPT-4o mini、Qwen-VL）中，不安全到安全转换率分别为75%、55%和58%。45%的不安全行为在误导性视觉内容下被接受。

Conclusion: 当前架构在多模态安全方面存在关键局限性，特别是智能体倾向于过度信任图像，该框架为研究多模态安全性、连贯性和社交动态提供了可复现平台。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合结构化和上下文知识，显著提升了自动生成综述的质量，为研究领域的知识组织提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

*Yilun Zhang,Dexing Kong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MMIA架构，通过可验证的推理过程解决LLM在医疗领域的错误问题，实现98%以上的错误检测率和低于1%的误报率，预计可降低85%处理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在医疗领域存在事实和逻辑错误，这在高风险医疗环境中不可接受，需要确保可靠性。

Method: 采用可形式化验证的推理过程，将复杂医疗任务递归分解为原子步骤，通过自动审计逻辑一致性和证据可追溯性，并引入"引导"模式存储已验证推理链作为"定理"，后续任务使用RAG进行低成本验证。

Result: 在四个医疗管理领域验证，错误检测率超过98%，误报率低于1%，显著优于基线LLM，RAG模式预计可降低85%平均处理成本。

Conclusion: MMIA的可验证推理框架是创建可信赖、透明且成本效益高的AI系统的重要一步，使LLM技术在医疗关键应用中可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

*Xiangwei Lv,JinLuan Yang,Wang Lin,Jingyuan Chen,Beishui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GRAIL框架，将测试时图域自适应重新定义为生成式图恢复问题，利用LLM将目标图恢复到类似源域的状态，无需访问源域数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图域自适应方法依赖源域数据，但源域数据常因隐私或安全问题不可用，因此需要开发不依赖源域数据的测试时图域自适应方法。

Method: 1. 将节点表示压缩为紧凑潜在特征；2. 使用图扩散过程建模图恢复过程；3. 量化模块将恢复特征编码为离散标记；4. 微调LLM作为生成式恢复器；5. 引入强化学习过程，使用对齐和置信度奖励指导。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GRAIL框架成功解决了测试时图域自适应问题，通过生成式图恢复方法在无需源域数据的情况下实现了有效的域适应。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ACONIC框架，通过约束问题建模和形式化复杂度度量来系统分解复杂任务，在组合优化和数据库查询任务上显著提升LLM性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂任务上存在可靠性问题，现有分解方法依赖启发式或人工分解，需要更系统的方法

Method: ACONIC框架将任务建模为约束问题，利用形式化复杂度度量指导任务分解

Result: 在SATBench和Spider任务上，基于复杂度度量的分解使智能体性能提升10-40个百分点

Conclusion: ACONIC框架提供了一种系统化的任务分解方法，能显著提升LLM在复杂任务上的表现

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO存在明显缺陷：模型的rollout响应上限完全由模型自身决定，无法从全对或全错的样本中获取知识。需要一种能充分利用所有样本并提升推理泛化能力的方法。

Method: 引入GCPO方法，在模型无法解决问题时，使用外部标准参考答案提供正确响应，引导模型向明确正确的更新方向学习。这种方法能充分利用每个样本，并让模型在训练中学习参考答案的解题策略。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上取得了优异结果，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: GCPO通过引入外部参考答案有效解决了现有强化学习方法的局限性，提高了训练效率和模型推理的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了PEEC博弈框架，研究追逐者在获取信息与暴露风险之间的权衡，开发了SHADOW多头强化学习框架，整合连续导航、离散通信和对手建模，在对抗环境中实现更高效的追逐策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗环境中，智能体需要在获取信息增强态势感知与避免暴露风险之间进行权衡。本文旨在研究这种战略平衡，特别是追逐者何时应该通信以获取逃避者位置信息，同时避免因通信而暴露自身位置。

Method: 提出PEEC博弈框架，开发SHADOW多头序列强化学习框架，整合连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手建模。通过多智能体强化学习训练移动策略，追逐者额外学习通信策略来平衡可观测性和风险。

Result: 实验评估显示SHADOW追逐者相比六个竞争基线实现了更高的成功率。消融研究证实时间序列建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要。敏感性分析表明学习策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SHADOW框架成功解决了对抗环境中的信息获取与风险暴露权衡问题，通过整合多种决策要素实现了高效的追逐策略，在复杂动态环境中展现出鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CityNav是一个基于LLM的分层框架，用于大规模多车辆动态导航，通过全局交通分配代理和局部导航代理的协同优化，在城市规模交通网络中实现高效导航和拥堵缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径搜索算法和强化学习方法难以扩展到城市规模网络，无法有效捕捉城市交通的非线性、随机性和耦合动态特性。

Method: 提出分层LLM框架，包含全局交通分配代理和局部导航代理，采用协同推理优化机制，通过个体奖励和共享奖励的双重奖励结构进行联合训练。

Result: 在四个真实道路网络（最大160万条道路和43万个交叉口）上的实验表明，CityNav在城市场景旅行效率和拥堵缓解方面持续优于九种经典路径搜索和基于RL的基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM具有实现可扩展、自适应和协作的城市范围交通导航的潜力，为复杂城市环境中的智能大规模车辆路由提供了基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our
project is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/CityNav.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced
reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a
high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to
evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional
analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and
expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics,
ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical
reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation
tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential
benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning
toward professional analyst-level competence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的时间序列预测方法存在架构边缘化、依赖粗糙统计文本提示和缺乏可解释性等局限性，需要开发更有效的LLM驱动框架。

Method: 采用两阶段师生架构：强大的教师LLM通过启发式搜索和成对因果测试从时间序列推断有向因果图；轻量级学生代理细化该图并在高置信度因果关联上进行微调，这些关联被编码为丰富的文本提示用于预测。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，Augur在25个基线方法中实现了有竞争力的性能，并展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Augur框架通过利用LLM的因果推理能力，不仅提高了预测准确性，还提供了透明、可追溯的变量交互推理过程，为时间序列预测提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval为评估DeepResearch系统提供了全面框架，支持系统能力比较，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在政府服务中的应用往往产生偏见或不正确输出，降低公民和公职人员的决策参与权。现有透明度实践过于技术化，难以让公众理解和行动。

Method: 结合以人为中心的AI透明度方法和社会技术系统视角，发展出公民AI系统的有意义透明度概念。

Result: 提出了一个框架，使透明度不仅限于技术解释，而是能够连接理解与行动可能性，让公众真正参与AI决策过程。

Conclusion: 有意义的透明度是解决AI系统在公共服务中偏见和参与不足问题的关键，需要超越技术层面，关注社会物质背景和行动可能性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Motivation: 现有LLM金融代理在回测中表现优异，但在知识窗口结束后收益急剧下降，这是因为LLM存在固有的信息泄露问题。

Method: 提出了FactFin框架，包含策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟器四个核心组件，通过反事实扰动迫使代理学习因果驱动因素而非记忆结果。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法在样本外泛化方面超越了所有基线，提供了优越的风险调整后性能。

Conclusion: FactFin框架有效缓解了LLM金融代理的信息泄露问题，提升了模型的因果推理能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

Motivation: 当前LLM作为AI智能体控制单元时缺乏个性化交互能力，RAG虽然提升了上下文感知但无法结合用户特定数据，现有个性化研究多停留在概念层面而缺乏技术实现。

Method: 基于统一个性化定义推导技术需求，结合多智能体协作和多源检索等成熟AI模式，构建集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架。

Conclusion: 集成持久记忆和用户档案能够显著提升基于LLM智能体的适应性和感知个性化，为未来工作提供指导方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了VoiceAgentBench基准测试，用于评估语音语言模型在真实语音代理场景中的表现，包含5500多个合成语音查询，支持多种印度语言，并测试工具调用、多轮交互和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音基准主要关注转录或问答等孤立能力，缺乏对多语言、文化理解和对抗鲁棒性的系统性评估。

Method: 创建包含单工具调用、多工具工作流、多轮交互和安全评估的合成语音查询集，使用基于说话人嵌入的采样算法最大化声学和说话人多样性。

Result: 实验揭示了当前SpeechLMs在上下文工具编排、印度语言泛化和对抗鲁棒性方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: VoiceAgentBench暴露了当前语音语言模型的关键局限性，为改进多语言和文化敏感的语音代理系统提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

TL;DR: ReInAgent是一个上下文感知的多智能体框架，通过动态信息管理和人机协作来解决移动GUI代理在模糊、动态和冲突任务场景中的信息困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动GUI代理过于强调自主操作，忽视了用户在任务执行中的主动参与，导致在信息困境场景下无法适应真实用户需求和偏好。

Method: 集成三个专门智能体：信息管理智能体负责基于槽位的信息管理和主动用户交互，决策智能体负责冲突感知规划，反思智能体负责任务反思和信息一致性验证。

Result: 在涉及信息困境的复杂任务中，ReInAgent比Mobile-Agent-v2实现了25%更高的成功率，能更有效地解决信息困境并产生更符合用户偏好的结果。

Conclusion: ReInAgent通过持续上下文信息分析和持续的人机协作，克服了现有方法依赖清晰静态任务假设的局限性，实现了在复杂真实场景中更自适应和可靠的移动任务导航。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在表示数值时并非连续表示，而是引入显著噪声，尽管能够高精度重建数值，但主成分只能解释嵌入空间中的一小部分变异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型是否真正将连续值建模为连续表示，以及它们在数值表示方面的实际表现。

Method: 使用线性重建和主成分分析等方法，评估三个主要提供商（OpenAI、Google Gemini和Voyage AI）的语言模型在数值嵌入空间中的表现。

Result: 虽然重建精度高（R² ≥ 0.95），但主成分只能解释嵌入空间中的一小部分变异，表明许多嵌入空间分量与简单数值输入空间正交。随着小数精度的增加，线性重建和解释方差都会下降。

Conclusion: 语言模型在数值表示方面存在非连续性和噪声问题，这对需要高数值精度、大数值范围或混合符号值的应用领域具有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

TL;DR: PEAR是一种基于阶段熵感知的奖励机制，通过在不同推理阶段施加不同的熵约束来控制大推理模型的响应长度，在保持准确性的同时显著缩短推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型生成的推理链往往过长且包含冗余步骤，增加了推理成本并降低了可用性。如何在保持准确性的同时控制推理长度是一个开放挑战。

Method: 提出PEAR奖励机制，在思维阶段惩罚过高的熵以鼓励简洁推理，在最终答案阶段允许适度的熵以保持灵活性，实现自适应长度控制。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的实验表明，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时保持竞争力的准确性，并展现出良好的分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于阶段熵的奖励设计是控制推理模型响应长度的有效方法，能在不牺牲性能的前提下实现简洁推理。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AILoRA是一种新的参数高效微调方法，通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验来解决LoRA在性能不佳和收敛慢方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然被广泛采用，但在实际部署中仍面临性能不理想和收敛速度慢的挑战。研究发现自注意力机制中的W^Q和W^V投影矩阵具有不同的参数特性，这源于它们的功能差异。

Method: AILoRA通过函数感知初始化策略，将W^Q的主成分注入以保持任务自适应能力，将W^V的次要成分注入以保留通用特征表示。这种非对称初始化使LoRA模块能更好地捕捉注意力参数的专业角色。

Result: 该方法增强了微调性能和收敛效率，通过更好地利用W^Q和W^V的功能差异来改进LoRA的效果。

Conclusion: AILoRA通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验，有效解决了LoRA的局限性，提升了参数高效微调的性能和效率。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

TL;DR: LinguaSim是一个基于大语言模型的框架，可将自然语言转换为逼真、交互式的3D场景，确保动态车辆交互和输入描述与生成场景的忠实对齐，通过反馈校准模块提高生成精度，降低碰撞率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在平衡命令遵循准确性和真实世界驾驶环境真实性方面存在困难，常通过限制场景为2D或非交互式预定义行为来降低复杂性，牺牲了真实性。

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，使用LLM将自然语言转换为交互式3D场景，包含反馈校准模块来优化生成精度，通过场景描述和自动驾驶模型约束对抗性车辆行为。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成与不同自然语言描述对齐的具有不同关键性的场景（危险描述ACT: 0.072s vs 安全描述3.532s；舒适度0.654 vs 0.764），精炼模块将碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim弥合了自然语言与闭环交互式仿真之间的差距，促进了高保真场景的创建，增强了安全测试和训练能力。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有保形选择方法仅适用于单阈值场景，无法满足实际应用中多条件选择的需求，如合取或析取条件。

Method: 提出了MCCS算法，包括为合取条件设计具有区域单调性的非保形分数，以及为析取条件使用全局Benjamini-Hochberg过程。

Result: 实验验证了MCCS相对于基线的优越性，在不同条件组合、现实世界模态和多任务可扩展性方面具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: MCCS算法在多条件环境下实现了严格的FDR控制选择，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

TL;DR: AutoQual是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，用于自动发现可解释特征，专注于在线评论质量评估，通过模拟人类研究过程迭代生成特征假设并实现工具化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线评论质量评估对电商平台至关重要，但质量是领域依赖且动态的概念。传统方法难以跨领域扩展且无法适应内容模式变化，而深度学习方法缺乏可解释性且可能过度关注语义而非质量。

Method: AutoQual框架模拟人类研究过程：通过反思迭代生成特征假设，通过自主工具实现操作化，并在持久内存中积累经验。该框架将数据中的隐性知识转化为显性、可计算的特征。

Result: 在拥有亿级用户的大型在线平台上部署，大规模A/B测试显示效果显著：每位用户平均查看评论数增加0.79%，评论阅读者转化率提高0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual成功解决了评论质量评估中的可扩展性和可解释性问题，证明了其作为将隐性知识转化为显性特征的通用框架的有效性。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

TL;DR: 提出了一个可证明公平的AI框架，通过系统性地移除敏感信息及其代理变量，使用OWL 2 QL本体工程定义敏感属性并通过逻辑推理推断代理变量，构建捕获偏差模式的sigma代数G，然后通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输获得公平表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服当前偏差缓解方法的局限性，确保AI系统的完全公平性，特别是在贷款审批等任务中，代理变量（如邮政编码）可能揭示种族等敏感信息。

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL本体工程形式化定义敏感属性，通过逻辑推理推断代理变量，构建sigma代数G捕获偏差模式，然后应用Delbaen Majumdar最优传输生成与G独立的变量，同时最小化L2距离以保持准确性。

Result: 开发了一个可证明公平的AI框架，确保真正的独立性而不仅仅是去相关，提供了可认证和数学基础的方法来构建可信赖的AI系统。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将偏差建模为sigma代数之间的依赖关系，将本体知识编译为可测量结构，并使用最优传输作为唯一的公平变换，确保了在AI任务中的完全公平性。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型在某些方面与人类行为保持一致，但存在明显差异，突显了改进生物中心可操纵性测量的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁进一步改进模型设计，确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而提高其在风险管理环境中的有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

TL;DR: PMFR提出了一种异步知识编排框架，通过解耦知识检索与响应生成来解决对话AI中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在显著降低延迟的同时保持响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放域对话系统中知识访问与响应延迟之间的根本矛盾，避免轻量级模型推理深度不足或工具增强代理同步执行导致交互阻塞的问题。

Method: 采用三组件架构：知识充分性评估器实时评估知识充足性，轻量级响应生成器提供即时交互，异步知识精炼代理在后台增强知识，通过智能触发机制保持对话流畅性。

Result: 在TopiOCQA评估中，PMFR实现了95.3%的延迟降低（23.38秒→1.09秒），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C：0.613 vs 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过时间解耦框架成功解决了延迟-质量权衡问题，证明了异步知识编排在保持对话流畅性的同时实现知识覆盖渐进增强的可行性。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

TL;DR: 提出了R-HORIZON方法来评估和增强大型推理模型的长视野推理能力，通过构建多步骤相互依赖的复杂推理任务基准，发现现有模型在长视野推理上表现不佳，并利用该基准数据通过强化学习显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单视野任务，无法充分评估模型理解和应对复杂长视野场景的能力，需要更全面的评估方法来测试大型推理模型的长视野推理能力。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合激发长视野推理行为，构建包含复杂多步骤推理任务的长视野推理基准，并利用该基准数据通过带验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）来训练模型。

Result: 评估发现即使最先进的大型推理模型在长视野推理任务上性能显著下降，模型表现出有限的有效推理长度和跨问题思维预算分配困难。使用R-HORIZON数据进行RLVR训练不仅大幅提升多视野推理任务性能，还在标准推理任务上提高7.5个AIME2024分数。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估大型推理模型的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

Result: 实现了可靠的测量流程，包括评分者间一致性、覆盖率报告、跨指数相关性和敏感性分析。协议、代码本、评分脚本和证据图都公开维护。

Conclusion: AIPI旨在引导激励措施向多元实践发展，并为政策制定者、采购者和公众提供可比较的证据，促进AI系统的多元治理。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

### [160] [The Tournament Tree Method for preference elicitation in Multi-criteria decision-making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08197)
*Diego García-Zamora,Álvaro Labella,José Rui Figueira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出锦标赛树方法(TTM)，一种新的偏好关系获取和评估框架，仅需m-1次两两比较就能获得完整、互反且一致的比较矩阵，显著降低认知负担和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两两比较方法需要m(m-1)/2次比较，认知负担重，存在不一致风险，且计算复杂度高。需要一种更高效、自动保证一致性的方法。

Method: TTM方法包含三个阶段：(i)使用减少的目标比较集获取专家判断，(ii)构建一致的两两比较矩阵，(iii)从结果矩阵推导全局价值尺度。该方法将偏好建模维度从m(m-1)/2降至m个参数。

Result: TTM方法自动保证一致性，最小化认知努力，与经典卡片法兼容，可处理区间和比率尺度，并开发了基于Web的工具展示实际应用性。

Conclusion: TTM方法有效解决了传统两两比较方法的局限性，提供了一种更高效、一致且实用的多准则决策支持框架。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

TL;DR: DODO算法让智能体通过干预自主学习环境因果结构，相比观测方法在多数情况下表现更好，能近乎零误差重建因果图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI主要依赖复杂相关性，缺乏因果理解。使AI具备因果意识能提升性能，深入理解环境机制。

Method: 智能体在隐藏因果DAG的环境中通过重复干预学习因果结构，使用因果推断技术分析观测变化的统计显著性。

Result: DODO在除最有限资源条件外的所有情况下优于观测方法，常能以接近零误差重建因果图结构，在最挑战配置中比最佳基线高0.25 F1分。

Conclusion: DODO算法有效实现了智能体自主学习环境因果结构，证明了干预方法在因果发现中的优势。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

TL;DR: 本文从因果视角重新审视推理任务，提出将推理任务建模为选择机制，其中高层逻辑概念作为选择算子作用于观察数据。作者开发了SR²框架，通过潜在变量反馈来学习密集依赖关系，在推理任务上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管人类能轻松解决推理任务，但现有的大语言模型即使在大量预训练和后训练后，仍无法可靠地进行推理。本文旨在从因果角度理解推理任务在潜在空间中的行为，并为解决其挑战提供见解。

Method: 提出SR²框架，包含三个关键模块：反射表示学习、依赖自精炼和周期性中间对齐。该框架将估计的潜在变量作为反馈纳入选择机制，促进学习潜在表示之间的密集依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明该方法在推理准确性上带来显著提升，例如在数独和迷宫任务上，相比最新进展，使用8倍更少的参数实现了超过10%的性能改进。

Conclusion: 从因果视角将推理任务建模为选择机制，并通过SR²框架学习潜在表示间的密集依赖关系，能够有效提升模型的推理能力，为复杂推理任务提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CoTri多步后门攻击，通过有序触发序列实现对LLM智能体的长期控制，攻击成功率接近100%且误触发率接近零，同时意外增强了智能体在良性任务上的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实应用中的快速部署，其可信度问题引发严重担忧。传统后门攻击仅限于单步控制，需要开发针对长期智能体控制的多步后门攻击方法。

Method: CoTri后门攻击基于有序触发序列，从初始触发开始，后续触发从环境中提取，实现多步操控使智能体偏离原定任务。该方法还通过训练数据建模环境的随机性。

Result: CoTri达到接近完美的攻击成功率(ASR)和接近零的误触发率(FTR)。植入CoTri反而增强了智能体在良性任务上的性能，并提高了对环境干扰的鲁棒性。在视觉语言模型上的验证证实了其可扩展到多模态智能体。

Conclusion: CoTri实现了智能体内的稳定多步控制，同时增强了其固有鲁棒性和任务能力，这使得攻击更加隐蔽，带来了潜在的安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统在三个核心维度面临的挑战：互操作性、交互协作和知识共享，为构建下一代高效、可扩展和智能的多智能体应用提供基础。

Method: 设计了三层协议框架：HAI（人机交互协议）标准化用户、界面和代理之间的信息流；UAP（统一代理协议）通过统一服务发现和协议转换实现异构代理互连；MEK（记忆-提取-知识协议）建立标准化认知链实现知识共享。

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Conclusion: 对称感知元网络是高效且可泛化的神经网络优化方法的有力途径。

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究反思行为对推理性能提升的实际贡献，探索如何优化推理过程的效率。

Method: 系统分析8个推理模型在5个数学数据集上的推理过程，构建不同反思步数的SFT数据集进行训练，并提出问题感知早停方法。

Result: 反思行为主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案；训练更多反思步数主要提升首次答案正确率；早停方法可减少24.5%的推理token，准确率仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 反思在推理中主要起确认作用，通过动态截断反思可以显著提高推理效率而保持性能。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出Cover@τ指标来替代Pass@k，用于更准确地评估语言模型在推理任务中的真实能力边界，避免随机猜测带来的误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Pass@k指标在大量采样时可能高估模型推理能力，因为离散答案空间中随机猜测也会提高成功率，这导致RLVR模型与基础模型的比较结果存在误导。

Method: 提出Cover@τ指标，衡量模型在至少τ比例补全正确的情况下能解决的问题比例，该指标能有效区分真实推理和随机猜测。

Result: 使用Cover@τ评估多个RLVR模型显示，与Pass@1相比，流行算法的相对排名发生变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: Cover@τ能更可靠地评估语言模型的推理能力边界，特别是在离散答案空间任务中，为模型比较提供了更准确的指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消费者调研成本高昂且存在面板偏见和规模限制，LLM模拟合成消费者时直接询问数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: SSR方法：从LLM获取文本响应，通过嵌入相似度将这些响应映射到参考陈述的Likert分布。

Result: 在57个个人护理产品调研数据集上测试，SSR达到90%的人类重测可靠性，保持现实的响应分布(KS相似度>0.85)，并提供丰富的定性反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在保持传统调研指标和可解释性的同时，实现可扩展的消费者研究模拟。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Result: 实验表明QAgent在问答任务中表现优异，可作为即插即用模块在实际系统中部署。

Conclusion: QAgent通过专注于有效检索的强化学习策略，提升了LLM应用的泛化能力，为实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Result: 广泛实验表明该方法能有效检测幻觉，并在各种场景中具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: 为LLM真实性检测贡献了新的幻觉检测范式，结合了理论优雅性和实际效率。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在认知合理的数据量限制下训练视觉语言模型，需要重新思考模型如何整合多模态信息，特别是在BabyLM Challenge 2025的视觉赛道约束下。

Method: 采用轻量级解码器架构，包含：(1) 基于token的动态门控机制，自适应融合语言和视觉线索；(2) 特征调制和通道注意力，最大化有限视觉信息的效用；(3) 辅助对比学习目标用于视觉基础。

Result: 在五个基准测试（BLiMP、BLiMP Supplement、EWoK、Winoground和VQA）上表现出与多模态基线相当或更优的性能。动态门控机制无需显式监督即可发现可解释的模式，对内容词偏好视觉线索，对功能词偏好语言线索。

Conclusion: 尽管存在挑战约束带来的限制（如全局图像嵌入造成的信息瓶颈和数据集分割导致的训练不稳定），但动态门控被证明是高效多模态学习的强大工具，在严格约束下既提供可解释性又保持性能。

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过集成领域知识和图搜索机制，显著提升了机器学习工程任务的稳定性和收敛速度，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

TL;DR: CaRT方法通过反事实轨迹对和语言推理训练LLMs学习何时停止信息收集，提高多轮交互任务中的决策效率和成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型在多轮交互任务中如何有效收集信息并知道何时停止收集、做出决策的问题，避免过度思考或偏离主题

Method: 使用反事实轨迹对进行微调：一条轨迹终止合适，另一条相同轨迹的微小修改版本终止不合适；训练LLM通过语言推理解释终止决策的合理性

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域中，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率

Conclusion: CaRT方法能有效教会LLMs何时停止寻求信息，在多轮交互任务中实现更高效和成功的决策

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度研究任务需要广度和深度的思考，涉及导航多样知识空间和推理复杂多步依赖关系，这对智能体系统提出了重大挑战

Method: FlowSearch多智能体框架主动构建和演化动态结构化知识流，支持并行探索和层次化任务分解，并根据中间推理结果实时调整知识流

Result: 在GAIA、HLE、GPQA和TRQA等通用和科学基准测试中实现最先进性能，展示了在多学科研究场景中的有效性

Conclusion: FlowSearch框架在深度研究任务中表现出色，具有推进科学发现的潜力

Abstract: Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and
depth of thinking. It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and
reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial
challenges for agentic systems. To address this, we propose FlowSearch, a
multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic structured
knowledge flow to drive subtask execution and reasoning. FlowSearch is capable
of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to enable parallel
exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also adjusting the
knowledge flow in real time based on feedback from intermediate reasoning
outcomes and insights. FlowSearch achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
general and scientific benchmarks, including GAIA, HLE, GPQA and TRQA,
demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research scenarios and
its potential to advance scientific discovery. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言智能体主要依赖专家数据监督微调，存在扩展困难和泛化能力差的问题。专家演示仅覆盖有限场景，缺乏环境多样性。需要一种介于模仿学习和完全经验驱动之间的中间范式。

Method: 提出早期经验范式，研究两种策略：1) 隐式世界建模，利用收集的状态在环境动态中锚定策略；2) 自我反思，智能体从次优行动中学习以改进推理和决策。

Result: 在八个多样化环境和多个模型家族中评估，方法持续提升有效性和跨域泛化能力。在有可验证奖励的环境中，结果为后续强化学习提供了良好基础。

Conclusion: 早期经验作为模仿学习和完全经验驱动智能体之间的实用桥梁，具有重要价值，为语言智能体的自主学习和改进提供了可行路径。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

TL;DR: 研究如何在不遗忘先前能力的情况下教授大型多模态模型新技能，发现通过选择性更新特定层可以显著减少遗忘问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型多模态模型在顺序微调过程中出现的灾难性遗忘问题，即在学习新技能时保持原有的通用能力

Method: 在三个模型家族上进行五个目标技能的序列微调，监控八个保留基准的性能，并开发了两种简单的调优方法：仅更新自注意力投影层或仅更新MLP的Gate&Up层

Result: 观察到窄微调后保留任务的明显"遗忘"可以在后续阶段部分恢复，通过选择性更新层的方法能够实现强目标增益同时保持保留性能

Conclusion: 通过控制输出令牌分布的偏移，识别出两种简单有效的调优方法，可在学习新技能时有效限制遗忘问题

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at
