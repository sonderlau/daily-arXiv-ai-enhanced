We identify\nthe shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame\ncan often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any\ntemporal reasoning.

With an appropriately constructed transformation,\nthis trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics\non three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.\nThe same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,\ncommonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany\nseveral recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations.

While current research primarily focuses on small object\ndetection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with\nno dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges\nand high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its\nperformance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely\ndue to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine\nspatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework\nspecifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.\nIt incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve\nfine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge\nprediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.\nMoreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented\nbounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications.

Numerous visual-only approaches\naddress these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,\nyet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex\nocclusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic\ncues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground\ninformation, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by\nhuman perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the\nforeground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background\ndistractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper\nproposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background\ninformation within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To\nhelp the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an\nintra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.\nSpecifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same\nsemantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between\nforeground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative\npower. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background\nregions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.\nComprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with\nresults that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches."}

While deep learning has shown excellent\nperformance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and\nchange moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be\ninferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,\nnamed CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure\nconsistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers\nchange area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time\nseries analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key\nsteps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,\nand Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference.

Subsequently, boundary\nenhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the\nCoarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the\nfirst step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two\ndistinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine\nChange Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class\nActivation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the\nchange-occurring moment from coarse change moments.

To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is\ncrucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a\nspoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing\nattack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a\nsubstantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is\ninjected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may\nbe erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we\npropose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent\nthreat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection.

To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN\nTransformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global\ncontextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially\ngrounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight\nTransformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on\nALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently\noutperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with\nfewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight\nthe potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte\ndetection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools."}
