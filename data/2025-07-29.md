*Joseph Ko,Jerry Harrington,Kara Sulia,Vanessa Przybylo,Marcus van Lier-Walqui,Kara Lamb*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的框架，从二维图像预测冰晶的三维微物理特性，包括有效密度、有效表面积和子弹数量，并验证了其高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰晶的微物理特性对云的辐射特性和时空分布有重要影响，进而影响地球气候，但直接测量这些特性具有挑战性。

Method: 通过3D建模软件生成合成冰晶，并用机器学习模型从二维图像预测三维特性，同时评估单视角和双视角模型的性能。

Result: 单视角模型在预测有效密度和有效表面积时R²值分别达到0.99和0.98，子弹数量的平衡准确率和F1分数为0.91；双视角模型进一步提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为从原位图像估计冰晶微物理特性提供了新方法，有助于改进微物理参数化模型。

Abstract: The microphysical properties of ice crystals are important because they
significantly alter the radiative properties and spatiotemporal distributions
of clouds, which in turn strongly affect Earth's climate. However, it is
challenging to measure key properties of ice crystals, such as mass or
morphological features. Here, we present a framework for predicting
three-dimensional (3D) microphysical properties of ice crystals from in situ
two-dimensional (2D) imagery. First, we computationally generate synthetic ice
crystals using 3D modeling software along with geometric parameters estimated
from the 2021 Ice Cryo-Encapsulation Balloon (ICEBall) field campaign. Then, we
use synthetic crystals to train machine learning (ML) models to predict
effective density ($\rho_{e}$), effective surface area ($A_e$), and number of
bullets ($N_b$) from synthetic rosette imagery. When tested on unseen synthetic
images, we find that our ML models can predict microphysical properties with
high accuracy. For $\rho_{e}$ and $A_e$, respectively, our best-performing
single view models achieved $R^2$ values of 0.99 and 0.98. For $N_b$, our best
single view model achieved a balanced accuracy and F1 score of 0.91. We also
quantify the marginal prediction improvements from incorporating a second view.
A stereo view ResNet-18 model reduced RMSE by 40% for both $\rho_e$ and $A_e$,
relative to a single view ResNet-18 model. For $N_b$, we find that a stereo
view ResNet-18 model improved the F1 score by 8%. This work provides a novel
ML-driven framework for estimating ice microphysical properties from in situ
imagery, which will allow for downstream constraints on microphysical
parameterizations, such as the mass-size relationship.

### [2] [Evolution of Extreme Madden-Julian Oscillation Events and their Impacts on South America](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20289)
*Mónica Minjares,Álvaro Corral,Marcelo Barreiro*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 研究分析了极端MJO事件的演变及其对南美洲夏季气候的影响，探讨了ENSO不同阶段对极端MJO事件的调节作用及其综合影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解极端MJO事件的特征及其对南美洲气候的影响，特别是与ENSO阶段的相互作用。

Method: 通过定义极端MJO事件的阈值，分析其起始阶段和持续时间，并结合OLR、涡流流函数和速度势的复合分析。

Result: 极端MJO事件多在阶段2-3起始，夏季分布更均衡；La Niña期间持续时间更长；极端事件对南美洲降雨异常的影响更显著。

Conclusion: 极端MJO事件对南美洲气候的影响比弱事件更显著，ENSO阶段对其持续时间有调节作用。

Abstract: This study examines the evolution of extreme Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO)
events and their impacts on South America during the austral summer.
Furthermore, the study explores how the different ENSO phases modulate extreme
MJO events, and how the combined effects impact South American climate. Extreme
MJO events are defined as those exceeding a specific threshold based on the
events distribution, distinguishing them from weak events. Our analysis shows
that extreme MJO events most frequently initiate in phases 2-3 throughout the
year, with similar distributions across phases 8-1, 6-7, and 4-5. This
distribution is also characteristic of winter, while in summer, initiation is
more balanced between phases 2-3 and 8-1. In contrast, weak events
predominantly start in phases 4-5 year-round, followed by phases 2-3, with
phases 8-1 and 6-7 occurring at similar frequencies. Seasonally, weak event
initiation prevails in phases 4-5 during summer, while in winter, it is evenly
distributed between phases 8-1 and 4-5. Additionally, during La Ni\~na, extreme
events tend to last longer than during El Ni\~no, a pattern not observed in
weak events. A composite analysis of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), eddy
streamfunction, and velocity potential was conducted, with particular focus on
the initiation phases 2-3 and 6-7 to determine which phases result in the most
significant impacts and how the associated anomalies evolve. The findings show
that enhanced (suppressed) convection centers in the equatorial region during
extreme events are more intense and exhibit a southeastern displacement
compared to those during weak events. These extreme MJO events influence the
South American rainfall Dipole (SAD), a key feature of regional climate
variability and results show that extreme MJO events induce more intense
rainfall anomalies of larger spatial extent compared to weak events.

### [3] [Evaluating satellite and reanalysis rainfall estimates for climate services in agriculture: a comprehensive methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20471)
*Danny Parsons,David Stern,Denis Ndanguza,Mouhamadou Bamba Sylla,James Musyoka,John Bagiliko,Graham Clarkson,Peter Dorward*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种评估卫星和再分析降雨数据（SRE）在农业应用中适用性的综合方法，包括空间一致性检查、主要比较、偏差校正和应用特定总结。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为缺乏地面测量网络的地区提供可靠的降雨数据，以支持农业气候服务。

Method: 采用四步方法：空间一致性检查、主要比较、偏差校正和应用特定总结，结合图形总结、标准比较指标和马尔可夫链模型。

Result: 通过非洲和加勒比地区的案例研究，验证了方法的实用性，并展示了如何评估SRE的多种特性。

Conclusion: 该方法为特定农业应用提供了评估SRE适用性的框架，填补了现有验证研究的空白。

Abstract: High-resolution rainfall estimates from satellite and reanalysis data sources
(SRE) could play a major role in improving climate services for agriculture.
This is particularly relevant in regions that predominantly rely on rain-fed
farming but lack a dense network of ground-based measurements to provide
localised historical climate information, as in most of the Global South.
However, there is a need for a framework which practitioners can use to
determine the suitability of these estimated data for specific agricultural
applications. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for evaluating
the ability of SRE to provide historical rainfall information for agricultural
applications, primarily through comparison with ground based measurements. The
methodology comprises four main steps: spatial consistency checks, main
comparisons, bias correction, and application specific summaries. The
methodology makes use of graphical summaries, standard comparison metrics, and
Markov chain models. We describe how users can apply this methodology to
evaluate rainfall estimates for specific applications, complementing existing
validation studies. Evaluation cases are presented to demonstrate the
methodology using five widely used satellite and reanalysis rainfall products
and ground-based measurements from 12 stations in Africa and the Caribbean. The
case studies demonstrate how the methodology can be applied to examine multiple
aspects of the rainfall estimates. While previous validation studies ask "Does
the SRE estimate the true rainfall well?", this methodology provides means of
establishing "To what extent can an SRE be used for this specific purpose?" and
a comprehensive framework for achieving this. This meets a major need for
location specific rainfall information to improve climate information services
for millions of small-holder farming households.

### [4] [AR-LIF: Adaptive reset leaky-integrate and fire neuron for spiking neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20746)
*Zeyu Huang,Wei Meng,Quan Liu,Kun Chen,Li Ma*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文设计了一种自适应重置神经元，解决了硬重置方法的信息丢失问题，并通过阈值调整策略在保持低能耗的同时提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有硬重置方法导致信息丢失，而软重置方法对神经元处理过于统一，因此需要一种更灵活的自适应重置方法。

Method: 设计了自适应重置神经元，建立输入、输出与重置之间的关联，并集成简单的阈值调整策略。

Result: 在各种数据集上表现优异，同时保持了低能耗的优势。

Conclusion: 自适应重置神经元有效解决了信息丢失问题，提升了性能，且适用于低能耗场景。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks possess the advantage of low energy consumption due
to their event-driven nature. Compared with binary spike outputs, their
inherent floating-point dynamics are more worthy of attention. The threshold
level and reset mode of neurons play a crucial role in determining the number
and timing of spikes. The existing hard reset method causes information loss,
while the improved soft reset method adopts a uniform treatment for neurons. In
response to this, this paper designs an adaptive reset neuron, establishing the
correlation between input, output and reset, and integrating a simple yet
effective threshold adjustment strategy. It achieves excellent performance on
various datasets while maintaining the advantage of low energy consumption.

### [5] [Why Flow Matching is Particle Swarm Optimization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20810)
*Kaichen Ouyang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文初步探讨了生成模型中的流匹配与进化计算中的粒子群优化（PSO）之间的对偶性，揭示了它们在数学表达和优化机制上的内在联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示流匹配与PSO之间的理论联系，为开发混合算法和统一分析框架奠定基础。

Method: 通过理论分析，比较流匹配与PSO的数学表达、优化机制和动态系统特性。

Result: 研究表明流匹配可视为PSO的连续推广，而PSO则是群体智能的离散实现。

Conclusion: 这一对偶性理解为开发新算法和统一分析框架提供了理论基础，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: This paper preliminarily investigates the duality between flow matching in
generative models and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in evolutionary
computation. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the intrinsic connections
between these two approaches in terms of their mathematical formulations and
optimization mechanisms: the vector field learning in flow matching shares
similar mathematical expressions with the velocity update rules in PSO; both
methods follow the fundamental framework of progressive evolution from initial
to target distributions; and both can be formulated as dynamical systems
governed by ordinary differential equations. Our study demonstrates that flow
matching can be viewed as a continuous generalization of PSO, while PSO
provides a discrete implementation of swarm intelligence principles. This
duality understanding establishes a theoretical foundation for developing novel
hybrid algorithms and creates a unified framework for analyzing both methods.
Although this paper only presents preliminary discussions, the revealed
correspondences suggest several promising research directions, including
improving swarm intelligence algorithms based on flow matching principles and
enhancing generative models using swarm intelligence concepts.

### [6] [Pareto-Grid-Guided Large Language Models for Fast and High-Quality Heuristics Design in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20923)
*Minh Hieu Ha,Hung Phan,Tung Duy Doan,Tung Dao,Dao Tran,Huynh Thi Thanh Binh*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: MPaGE是一种结合LLM和PFG技术的多目标组合优化方法，优于现有LLM框架，与传统MOEAs竞争，且运行更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统进化算法依赖领域知识和参数调优的问题，利用LLM的自动启发式生成能力，填补多目标优化中启发式多样性和运行时效率的研究空白。

Method: 基于SEMO框架，引入PFG技术划分目标空间，利用LLM生成语义多样的启发式，提升种群多样性。

Result: MPaGE在性能上优于现有LLM框架，与传统MOEAs相当，且运行速度显著更快。

Conclusion: MPaGE通过结合LLM和PFG技术，有效提升了多目标优化的启发式多样性和运行时效率。

Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise
in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of
conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be
effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter
tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently,
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has
opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced
language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most
existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often
neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic
diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a
novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO)
framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By
partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing
candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize
heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus
promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through
extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing
LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional
Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster
runtime. Our code is available at: https://github.com/langkhachhoha/MPaGE.

*Ghufran Abualhail Alhamzawi,Ali Saeed Alfoudi,Ali Hakem Alsaeedi,Suha Mohammed Hadi,Amjed Abbas Ahmed,Md. Riad Hassan,Nurhizam Safie Mohd Satar,Waeel Yahya Yasseen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自适应伽马校正（TAGC）的低光照图像增强模型，通过自动计算伽马值提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光照条件下图像质量下降，表现为低对比度、噪声和细节模糊，需要高效解决方案。

Method: 分析图像颜色亮度，计算平均颜色以确定自适应伽马系数，无需人工干预。

Result: 模型有效提升图像质量，保持细节、自然对比度和正确色彩分布。

Conclusion: TAGC是处理低光照图像的高效解决方案，适用于监控、医学图像和摄影等领域。

Abstract: Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in
computer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of
images, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This
paper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive
gamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of
the low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive
gamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively
at different illumination levels suitable for the image without human
intervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative
evaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved
low-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color
distribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a
more efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple
applications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical
images, and photography in low-light environments.

### [8] [Is Exchangeability better than I.I.D to handle Data Distribution Shifts while Pooling Data for Data-scarce Medical image segmentation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19575)
*Ayush Roy,Samin Enam,Jun Xia,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande,Won Hwa Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决医学影像数据稀缺问题的方法，通过控制深度网络中前景-背景特征差异，提升数据添加场景下的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺是深度学习模型的主要挑战，数据池化和数据添加虽能提升性能，但可能引发分布偏移问题。

Method: 利用因果框架控制深度网络中前景-背景特征差异，优化特征表示。

Result: 在五个数据集（包括新贡献的超声数据集）上实现了最先进的分割性能，定性结果显示更精细的分割图。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据添加场景下有效，提升了医学影像分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep
learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)
and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to
enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,
increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can
induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model
performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the
traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming
exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data
pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these
conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for
controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of
deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are
crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five
datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and
contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate
segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model
architectures. The code will be available on Github.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型Transformer感知的多尺度渐进编码器-解码器网络（T-MPEDNet），用于CT扫描中肝脏及其肿瘤的自动分割，解决了肿瘤异质性和肝脏视觉多样性带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝脏和肿瘤的精确自动分割对快速诊断和治疗计划至关重要，但现有方法面临肿瘤异质性和肝脏视觉多样性的挑战。

Method: T-MPEDNet采用渐进编码器-解码器结构，结合Transformer动态注意力机制和多尺度特征利用，通过形态学边界细化提升分割精度。

Result: 在LiTS和3DIRCADb数据集上，T-MPEDNet的肝脏分割DSC分别达到97.6%和98.3%，肿瘤分割DSC分别为89.1%和83.3%，优于12种先进方法。

Conclusion: T-MPEDNet是一种高效可靠的肝脏和肿瘤自动分割框架。

Abstract: Precise and automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor within CT scans
plays a pivotal role in swift diagnosis and the development of optimal
treatment plans for individuals with liver diseases and malignancies. However,
automated liver and tumor segmentation faces significant hurdles arising from
the inherent heterogeneity of tumors and the diverse visual characteristics of
livers across a broad spectrum of patients. Aiming to address these challenges,
we present a novel Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder
Network (T-MPEDNet) for automated segmentation of tumor and liver. T-MPEDNet
leverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive
encoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating
channel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A
Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual
relationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale
feature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.
Morphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct
boundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding
precise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed
on two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet
compared to twelve state-of-the-art methods. On LiTS, T-MPEDNet achieves
outstanding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 97.6% and 89.1% for liver and
tumor segmentation, respectively. Similar performance is observed on 3DIRCADb,
with DSCs of 98.3% and 83.3% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively.
Our findings prove that T-MPEDNet is an efficacious and reliable framework for
automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor in CT scans.

*Meng Wei,Charlie Budd,Oluwatosin Alabi,Miaojing Shi,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgPIS提出了一种统一的部分感知实例分割（PIS）方法，用于手术器械分割，结合了实例级和部分级分割任务，并通过弱监督学习和师生框架解决了数据标注不完整的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅单独处理实例级或部分级分割任务，缺乏交互，限制了手术器械分割的自动化效果。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的掩码分类方法，引入部分特定查询，并通过弱监督学习和师生框架训练模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了SurgPIS的有效性，实现了PIS、IIS、PSS和语义分割的最优性能。

Conclusion: SurgPIS为手术器械分割提供了一种统一的解决方案，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Consistent surgical instrument segmentation is critical for automation in
robot-assisted surgery. Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level
instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS)
separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate
a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation
(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical
instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach
and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object
queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In
order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and
part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS
to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During
training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby
allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A
student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for
missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS
labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the
effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well
as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: 该研究通过多模态交互和对象中心推理扩展了VideoLLM的能力，为视频理解任务提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily
focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses,
restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In
this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by
introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for
input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users
to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose
STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates
arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames
within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric
video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require
reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other
existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object
segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed
model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and
segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video
and image understanding. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中的异常检测面临特征表示差异和复杂解剖结构关系的挑战，现有方法难以学习有效的类别特定特征。

Method: 采用多模态对比检测器Exemplar Med-DETR，结合跨注意力和迭代训练策略，利用直观的类别特定示例特征进行检测。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在医学影像中实现稳健和通用检测系统的潜力。

Abstract: Detecting abnormalities in medical images poses unique challenges due to
differences in feature representations and the intricate relationship between
anatomical structures and abnormalities. This is especially evident in
mammography, where dense breast tissue can obscure lesions, complicating
radiological interpretation. Despite leveraging anatomical and semantic
context, existing detection methods struggle to learn effective class-specific
features, limiting their applicability across different tasks and imaging
modalities. In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal
contrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs
cross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar
features and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets.
On Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass
detection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16
percentage points. Additionally, a radiologist-supported evaluation of 100
mammograms from an out-of-distribution Chinese cohort demonstrates a twofold
gain in lesion detection performance. For chest X-rays and angiography, we
achieve an mAP of 0.25 for mass and 0.37 for stenosis detection, improving
results by 4 and 7 percentage points, respectively. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to advance robust and generalizable detection systems
for medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation continues to advance rapidly, yet rigorous
comparison between methods remains challenging due to a lack of standardized
and customizable tooling. In this work, we present the current state of the
Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), with a particular focus on its
flexible and modular postprocessing framework designed for the BraTS 2025 pre-
and post-treatment glioma segmentation challenge. Since its debut in the 2024
BraTS adult glioma post-treatment segmentation challenge, MIST's postprocessing
module has been significantly extended to support a wide range of transforms,
including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest
connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and
closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies,
enabling fine-grained control over the final segmentation output. We evaluate
three such strategies - ranging from simple small-object removal to more
complex, class-specific pipelines - and rank their performance using the BraTS
ranking protocol. Our results highlight how MIST facilitates rapid
experimentation and targeted refinement, ultimately producing high-quality
segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge. MIST remains open source and
extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image
segmentation.

such as older adults with dementia, represents a critical healthcare challenge.
Robust automated systems of pain detection may facilitate such assessments.
Existing pain detection datasets, however, suffer from limited ethnic/racial
diversity, privacy constraints, and underrepresentation of older adults who are
the primary target population for clinical deployment. We present SynPAIN, a
large-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355
neutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:
20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we
created demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically
meaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain
expressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than
neutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment
tools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate
SynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection
models. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial
performance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance
disparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation
improves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0%
improvement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain
assessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically
diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection,
while establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.

*Mandar Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于半监督学习的标签高效微调策略，利用未标记数据和直接偏好优化（DPO）提升紧凑视觉语言模型（VLM）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于手动或API标注成本高昂，监督微调视觉语言模型面临规模挑战，因此需要一种标签高效的半监督方法。

Method: 结合PEFT和DPO，利用未标记数据生成偏好链并微调模型，实现高效收敛。

Result: 在12个电商领域的数据集上，DPO微调显著优于监督模型，且性能随未标记数据增加而提升。

Conclusion: 未标记数据可通过DPO有效提升模型性能，为标签稀缺问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with
numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models
(VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API
based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage
unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ
PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with
unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled
sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on
self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated
model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method
achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset
spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes
only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised
model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training
improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled
samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

Result: DeepJIVE成功揭示了多模态数据的联合和独立变化，并在ADNI数据中发现了淀粉样蛋白PET与MR图像之间的生物学合理共变模式。

Conclusion: DeepJIVE是多模态数据分析的有用工具。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive
assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type
but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle
high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we
introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual
Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental
validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets.
Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints
for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found
that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of
multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible
covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and
magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a
useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

Conclusion: Co-Win提升了自动驾驶系统的下游决策和规划能力。

Abstract: Accurate perception and scene understanding in complex urban environments is
a critical challenge for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation. In
this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception
framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel
window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in
environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture
comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based
decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object
relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple
regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with
mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and
understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through
progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both
data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces
interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream
decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.

Result: 研究发现合成人脸检测器普遍存在偏见，且偏见的来源与训练数据中属性的平衡性及检测器的激活图相关。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了合成人脸检测器的偏见问题及其来源，为未来减少偏见提供了方向。

Abstract: Bias analysis for synthetic face detection is bound to become a critical
topic in the coming years. Although many detection models have been developed
and several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content,
one crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training
datasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain
demographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues.
In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the
analysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial
attributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly
distributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could
otherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed
framework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five
state-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial
attributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face
detectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial
attributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias
through the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial
attributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors
activation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决颜色视频处理中QSVD计算复杂度高和四元数矩阵无法有效分离颜色通道的问题，以丰富标注数据集并提升深度学习模型的泛化能力。

Method: 利用四元数黎曼流形降低QSVD计算复杂度至o(1)，提出uQRPCA框架平衡目标分割和背景恢复，并通过CR1B方法进一步优化背景恢复。

Result: uQRPCA+在移动目标检测和背景恢复任务上达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: uQRPCA+通过高效的四元数处理和CR1B方法，显著提升了颜色视频中目标检测和背景恢复的效果。

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at
generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos
captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously
extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich
annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep
models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for
color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular
Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1
quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we
reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion
Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA)
framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and
recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by
introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain
the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate
our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target
detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source
methods. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub at

Motivation: 研究LiDAR在稀疏条件下对立体匹配的指导效果，发现稀疏LiDAR数据会导致性能下降，需寻找解决方案。

Method: 提出预填充稀疏初始视差图的简单方法，并结合早期融合中的不同预填充策略。

Result: 提出的GRAFT-Stereo方法在稀疏LiDAR条件下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究为LiDAR引导的立体匹配方法提供了新思路，有望激发更多有效方法。

Abstract: We investigate LiDAR guidance within the RAFT-Stereo framework, aiming to
improve stereo matching accuracy by injecting precise LiDAR depth into the
initial disparity map. We find that the effectiveness of LiDAR guidance
drastically degrades when the LiDAR points become sparse (e.g., a few hundred
points per frame), and we offer a novel explanation from a signal processing
perspective. This insight leads to a surprisingly simple solution that enables
LiDAR-guided RAFT-Stereo to thrive: pre-filling the sparse initial disparity
map with interpolation. Interestingly, we find that pre-filling is also
effective when injecting LiDAR depth into image features via early fusion, but
for a fundamentally different reason, necessitating a distinct pre-filling
approach. By combining both solutions, the proposed Guided RAFT-Stereo
(GRAFT-Stereo) significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods under
sparse LiDAR conditions across various datasets. We hope this study inspires
more effective LiDAR-guided stereo methods.

Result: 在YouTube-VIS 2022数据集上达到54.0的AP分数，性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LOMM通过创新的内存管理和对象关联策略，为视频实例分割提供了更稳定和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Latest Object Memory Management (LOMM) for
temporally consistent video instance segmentation that significantly improves
long-term instance tracking. At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory
(LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of
objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables
consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing
both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we
introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately
handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory
system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and
ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects
frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting
a new benchmark in VIS. Notably, our LOMM achieves state-of-the-art AP score of
54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, a dataset known for its challenging long videos.

Motivation: 社交媒体上广泛使用的面部修饰技术引发了对面部图像真实性的担忧，现有方法仅关注检测修饰，而如何准确恢复原始面部尚未解决。

Method: 提出MoFRR方法，采用混合扩散模型，结合稀疏激活的专家处理不同修饰类型，以及共享专家处理通用修饰痕迹。每个专家采用双分支结构，包括基于DDIM的低频分支和基于交叉注意力的高频分支。

Result: 在RetouchingFFHQ++数据集上的实验表明，MoFRR在恢复原始面部方面表现出色。

Conclusion: MoFRR为解决面部修饰恢复问题提供了有效方法，尤其在处理复杂修饰操作时表现优异。

Abstract: The widespread use of face retouching on social media platforms raises
concerns about the authenticity of face images. While existing methods focus on
detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from
the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face
Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring
original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional
image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with
various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the
low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose
MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert
isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts
handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert
dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a
dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an
Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based
High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a
newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the
effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.

Motivation: 尽管MAE在自监督表示学习中取得了成功，但其具体学习机制尚不明确。本文旨在揭示MAE的内在学习模式，并基于此改进其掩码策略。

Method: 通过深入分析发现MAE早期即学习到基于模式的块级聚类，提出自引导MAE，利用聚类信息生成智能掩码，替代原始随机掩码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了学习效率，且无需依赖外部模型或额外信息。

Conclusion: 自引导MAE在多种下游任务中验证了其有效性，保持了MAE自监督学习的优势。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation
learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer
vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how
MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that
MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly
early stages of pretraining. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided
masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its
progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the
vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without
relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the
benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on
various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制在点云学习中存在二次复杂度问题，限制了远距离依赖建模。状态空间模型（S6）因其线性复杂度和优秀的远距离建模能力被引入点云学习，但仍存在点云序列化和局部学习的不足。

Method: 设计了shuffle序列化策略以适应S6的因果性，提出ConvBiS6层协同捕获局部几何和全局上下文依赖，并扩展多头设计为MHS6增强建模能力。

Result: HydraMamba在对象级和场景级任务中均取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: HydraMamba通过改进序列化和局部学习，显著提升了点云学习的性能。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a dominant operator in point cloud
learning, but its quadratic complexity leads to limited inter-point
interactions, hindering long-range dependency modeling between objects. Due to
excellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective
state space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud
learning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud.
Despite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect
point cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we
explore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to
address the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization
strategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of
S6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality
learning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local
geometries and global context dependencies synergistically. Besides, we propose
MHS6 by extending the multi-head design to S6, further enhancing its modeling
capability. HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks at
both object-level and scene-level. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，JDATT在视觉恢复和检测精度上表现优异，同时显著减少模型大小和推理时间。

Conclusion: JDATT适合实时部署，解决了现有方法的复杂性和效率问题。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence (AT) introduces severe degradations, such as rippling,
blur, and intensity fluctuations, that hinder both image quality and downstream
vision tasks like target detection. While recent deep learning-based approaches
have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their
high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time
applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote
surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation
and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for
Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates
state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified
knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while
minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme:
feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked
Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via
Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence
datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and
detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time,
making it well-suited for real-time deployment.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，验证了运动知识转移的有效性。

Conclusion: TransFlow通过生成逼真训练数据，解决了视频显著目标检测的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Video salient object detection (SOD) relies on motion cues to distinguish
salient objects from backgrounds, but training such models is limited by scarce
video datasets compared to abundant image datasets. Existing approaches that
use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail
for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical
flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which
transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate
realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich
semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different
objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to
generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects
exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and
temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.

Result: 在所有公开VOS基准测试中实现新的最佳性能。

Conclusion: DepthFlow为数据稀缺问题提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect the most
prominent object in a video. Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both
RGB images and optical flow have gained significant attention, but their
performance is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of training data. To
address this, we propose DepthFlow, a novel data generation method that
synthesizes optical flow from single images. Our approach is driven by the key
insight that VOS models depend more on structural information embedded in flow
maps than on their geometric accuracy, and that this structure is highly
correlated with depth. We first estimate a depth map from a source image and
then convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural
cues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs
into image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available
for network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with
our synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public
VOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data
scarcity problem.

Result: 研究表明，精心设计的神经网络架构可以显著提高效率，使模型更小、更快、更经济。

Conclusion: 通过架构优化，可以在减少计算资源的同时提升模型性能，适用于资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Major advancements in the capabilities of computer vision models have been
primarily fueled by rapid expansion of datasets, model parameters, and
computational budgets, leading to ever-increasing demands on computational
infrastructure. However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse
and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for
architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer
computational resources.
  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models
can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands.
We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus
on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into
and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our
models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to
become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural
architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This
section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention
increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we
explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage
these properties to better distill model knowledge.
  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures
can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to
become smaller, faster, and cheaper.

Abstract: Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in
photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing
methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide
essential geometric references and layout information for document image
correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet)
to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we
initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts
detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a
foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable
and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to
leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the
distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that

Motivation: 现有解码器查询类型（如内容查询和位置查询）的作用尚未充分探索，固定查询限制了灵活性，且学习过程中存在ROT和查询模糊性问题。

Method: 提出DS-Det，引入单查询范式，将固定查询转为灵活查询；通过注意力解耦学习简化解码器框架，解决ROT和查询模糊性问题；提出PoCoo损失函数优化小目标检测。

Conclusion: DS-Det通过灵活查询和注意力解耦学习，显著提升了检测效率，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through
query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing
decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still
underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number
(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of
these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between
two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention
(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query
ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both
one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's
one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,
a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in
images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query
paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.
Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention
disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many
process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),
addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder
efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size
priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects.
Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and
WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of
DS-Det. The source codes are available at

Abstract: Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic
segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level
annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class
without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of
images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled
by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these
works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and
thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or
the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In
this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,
from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.
In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object
localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region
expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the
semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively
spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale
self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image
often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences,
compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a
more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates
high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional
training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FM-LC框架通过多阶段U-Net和专家模型改进干旱地区城市洪水测绘，显著提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 干旱地区城市洪水对基础设施和社区构成严重威胁，传统测绘方法因光谱对比度低和动态水文条件而受限。

Method: FM-LC采用三阶段方法：多类U-Net初步分类，专家模型纠正混淆类别，贝叶斯平滑优化边界。

Result: 在迪拜2024年风暴事件中验证，FM-LC平均F1分数提升29%，洪水边界更清晰。

Conclusion: FM-LC框架显著优于传统单阶段方法，为干旱地区洪水测绘提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Urban flooding in arid regions poses severe risks to infrastructure and
communities. Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery
trajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and
resilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral
contrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and
highly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional
flood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides
the temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a
hierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this
challenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial
multi-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and
bare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between
spectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early
checking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a
lightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the
flagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines
boundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.
We validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and
post-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average
F1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably
sharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional
single-stage U-Net baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代城市环境中，海量视频数据需要高效分析，但现有SQL范式限制了查询灵活性。

Method: Lava系统包含三个组件：高效采样、开放世界检测和轨迹提取，支持自然语言查询。

Result: 实验表明，Lava在查询性能、精度和处理速度上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Lava为大规模视频数据分析提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of
operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video
analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an
SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this
constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories,
significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a
language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and
efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language.
Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language
queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and
arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a
multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level
localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval;
and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object
association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing
diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained
annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that
\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$,
reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$
precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $
faster than the most accurate baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统连续手语识别方法中多阶段流程导致的错误传播、过拟合和词汇扩展瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用1D CNN进行时间压缩处理姿态序列，结合预训练的AraGPT2解码器直接生成文本（手势注释）。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，AutoSign的WER分数比现有最佳方法提高了6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoSign通过消除多阶段流程，直接学习特征与手势注释之间的映射，显著提升了连续手语识别的效果。

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a
key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired
communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and
body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a
combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)
methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then
align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based
approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error
propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary
scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address
these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only
transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,
bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this
decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and
the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the
textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal
compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,
followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).
Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body
gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.
By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial
improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to
6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决负提示调优在OOD检测中泛化性能下降的问题。

Method: 结合负特征调优（NFT）和知识正则化（KR）策略，动态适应图像并分离正负特征空间。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，KR-NFT显著降低了FPR95，并提升了ID分类和OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: KR-NFT在OOD检测中表现出高效性和可扩展性，同时减少了对预训练知识的遗忘。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine
learning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection
capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from
reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative
Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture
termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding
knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies
distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively
separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation
maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.
Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a
lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and
mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional
negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.
To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is
designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating
pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on
trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID
datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,
KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also
significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\% under an unexplored generalization
setting with unseen ID categories. Codes can be found at

Conclusion: FineMotion数据集显著提升细粒度运动生成任务，并支持零样本编辑。

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions from textual descriptions has undergone
significant advancements. However, existing methods often overlook specific
body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by
enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose
the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets -
short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed
descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes
about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of
entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of
our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task,
especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM
model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion
editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal
dimensions via text. Dataset and code available at: CVI-SZU/FineMotion

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SAMA的结构感知和运动自适应框架，用于解决现有Mamba方法在姿态提升任务中难以建模复杂关节连接和运动差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过2D到1D映射建模关节依赖，但难以处理复杂的关节连接和运动特性差异。

Method: SAMA框架包含结构感知状态整合器（SSI）和运动自适应状态调制器（MSM），分别处理关节拓扑和运动特性。

Result: 实验表明，SAMA在多个基准测试中取得了先进结果，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: SAMA通过结构感知和运动自适应设计，有效提升了姿态任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint
dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though
effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly
process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic
differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a
structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology
along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically,
SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive
State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with
leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint
feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than
sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is
responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus
applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different
joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware
and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer
computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有融合方法依赖实例提案或密集BEV网格，缺乏整体场景理解或受限于刚性网格结构。

Method: RaGS采用级联流程：FLI初始化高斯位置，IMA融合语义和几何信息，MGF渲染多级BEV特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: RaGS通过动态聚焦稀疏目标，实现了高效且全面的场景感知。

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous
driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular
images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either
instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene
understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we
propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as
representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.
3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of
Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing
a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to
construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based
Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize
coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)
fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of
interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians
into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing
on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while
offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on
View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its
state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

Motivation: 开放世界目标检测（OWOD）需要识别已知和未知物体，但现有方法依赖大量标注数据且易过拟合，灵活性不足。

Method: 提出OW-CLIP系统，结合多模态提示调优、Crop-Smoothing技术和双模态数据精炼方法，并开发可视化界面辅助标注。

Result: OW-CLIP性能达到SOTA的89%，仅需3.8%的自生成数据，且在相同数据量下优于SOTA方法。

Conclusion: OW-CLIP通过数据高效训练和高质量标注解决了OWOD的关键问题，展示了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Open-world object detection (OWOD) extends traditional object detection to
identifying both known and unknown object, necessitating continuous model
adaptation as new annotations emerge. Current approaches face significant
limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of
crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting,"
and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To
tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that
provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental
training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored
for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate
partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training
methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large
language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering.
Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to
explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual
feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation
demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of
state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data,
while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A
case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved
annotation quality of our visualization system.

Method: 提出DiffCode框架，结合任务自适应码本库和潜在扩散策略，补偿多样化信息损失并优化先验特征检索。

Result: DiffCode在MRI超分辨率、CT去噪和PET合成三个任务中，定量指标和视觉质量均表现优异。

Conclusion: DiffCode通过整合任务特异性先验特征和扩散模型的强大映射能力，为多任务MedIR提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: All-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to address multiple MedIR
tasks using a unified model, concurrently recovering various high-quality (HQ)
medical images (e.g., MRI, CT, and PET) from low-quality (LQ) counterparts.
However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the
heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations,
leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle
to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced
vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel
framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to
compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks,
DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ
prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to
enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent
diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping
capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating
more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the
task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves
superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across
three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

Conclusion: ATCTrack通过动态对齐多模态线索和特征建模，显著提升了复杂长时场景下的跟踪鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking aims to locate the target object in the video
sequence using a template patch and a language description provided in the
initial frame. To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term
scenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT,
it is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to
utilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and
textual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align
only with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states
are constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is
intractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers
(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our
experiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain
to the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In
this work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain
multimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive
Target-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.
Specifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal
visual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely
visual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words
identification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative
context words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.
(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack
achieves a new SOTA performance. The code and models will be released at:

Abstract: This work introduces a self-supervised neuro-analytical, cost efficient,
model for visual-based quadrotor control in which a small 1.7M parameters
student ConvNet learns automatically from an analytical teacher, an improved
image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller. Our IBVS system solves numerical
instabilities by reducing the classical visual servoing equations and enabling
efficient stable image feature detection. Through knowledge distillation, the
student model achieves 11x faster inference compared to the teacher IBVS
pipeline, while demonstrating similar control accuracy at a significantly lower
computational and memory cost. Our vision-only self-supervised neuro-analytic
control, enables quadrotor orientation and movement without requiring explicit
geometric models or fiducial markers. The proposed methodology leverages
simulation-to-reality transfer learning and is validated on a small drone
platform in GPS-denied indoor environments. Our key contributions include: (1)
an analytical IBVS teacher that solves numerical instabilities inherent in
classical approaches, (2) a two-stage segmentation pipeline combining YOLOv11
with a U-Net-based mask splitter for robust anterior-posterior vehicle
segmentation to correctly estimate the orientation of the target, and (3) an
efficient knowledge distillation dual-path system, which transfers geometric
visual servoing capabilities from the analytical IBVS teacher to a compact and
small student neural network that outperforms the teacher, while being suitable
for real-time onboard deployment.

classification by enabling collaborative training across multiple clients
without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation
of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R,
the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for
synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises
two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that
generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge
distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from
multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes,
BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly
outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model
trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for
autonomous driving under federated learning

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重新训练的插件方法RCA，通过调整注意力权重提升视觉语言Transformer中的目标定位能力，并在OV-RefOD任务中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言Transformer中目标定位能力不足的问题，尤其是语义相关但被抑制的token对预测的贡献不足。

Method: RCA通过抑制极端值并增强中等激活值，重新加权最终层注意力，使语义相关但被抑制的token能更好地指导预测。

Result: 在15个开源VLM中的11个上提升了FitAP指标，最高提升26.6%。效果与注意力锐度和融合时机相关。

Conclusion: RCA为多模态Transformer提供了可解释性和性能提升，揭示了模型容量和解耦能力的关键作用。

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances
object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA
reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying
mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide
predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection
(OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based
on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with
gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion
timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like
$\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement
as key factors. RCA offers both interpretability and performance gains for
multimodal transformers.

TL;DR: TrackAny3D是一个类别无关的3D单目标跟踪框架，利用大规模预训练模型和几何专家混合架构，实现了高性能和强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有类别特定方法在实际应用中的局限性，如需要为每个类别单独训练模型且泛化能力不足。

Method: 结合参数高效适配器、几何专家混合架构（MoGE）和时间上下文优化策略，包括可学习时间令牌和动态掩码加权模块。

Result: 在三个常用基准测试中达到最先进的性能，表现出强泛化能力和竞争力。

Conclusion: TrackAny3D展示了统一模型的重要性，并为大规模预训练模型在该领域的应用提供了启示。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR-based single object tracking (SOT) relies on sparse and irregular
point clouds, posing challenges from geometric variations in scale, motion
patterns, and structural complexity across object categories. Current
category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for
real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited
generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first
framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D
SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between
pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we
introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively
activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics.
Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that
incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to
propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on
three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new
state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong
generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the
community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of
large-scale pretrained models in this field.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于深度子空间聚类（DSC）的小批量训练策略，通过引入记忆库保存全局特征表示，克服了传统方法依赖全批处理的瓶颈。此外，还提出了一种无解码器框架，利用对比学习替代自编码，显著降低了计算开销。


<details>

Motivation: 现有DSC方法依赖全批处理，限制了其在复杂架构和高分辨率图像上的可扩展性。

Method: 结合记忆库实现小批量训练，并提出无解码器框架，利用对比学习进行表示学习。

Result: 在COIL100和ORL数据集上表现优于其他先进方法，性能接近全批处理方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为DSC提供了高效且可扩展的训练策略，显著提升了性能并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering
computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures.
However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically
combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch
processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which
requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a
self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch
training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global
feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep
architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming
previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale
pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free
framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for
representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational
overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves
performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other
state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by
fine-tuning deep networks.

Result: 实验表明，HumanSAM在二进制和多类伪造分类中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HumanSAM通过细粒度分类和特征融合，显著提升了伪造视频检测的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric
ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human
information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary
forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery
types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which
are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we
propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges
of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify
human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly
observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To
better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal
consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing
two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a
rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn
more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and
evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery
Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated
semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in
comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class
forgery classification.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided
diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are
usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have
been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their
superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the
real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear
self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this
issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for
its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,
particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose
MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.
Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a
bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the
texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging
convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range
dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to
combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate
generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and
Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance
segmentation tasks. The code is available at

Result: LLM_Control在多个预训练T2I模型上表现出色，生成质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLM_Control有效解决了复杂输入条件下的T2I生成问题，具有竞争力。

Abstract: Recent spatial control methods for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
shown compelling results. However, these methods still fail to precisely follow
the control conditions and generate the corresponding images, especially when
encountering the textual prompts that contain multiple objects or have complex
spatial compositions. In this work, we present a LLM-guided framework called
LLM\_Control to address the challenges of the controllable T2I generation task.
By improving grounding capabilities, LLM\_Control is introduced to accurately
modulate the pre-trained diffusion models, where visual conditions and textual
prompts influence the structures and appearance generation in a complementary
way. We utilize the multimodal LLM as a global controller to arrange spatial
layouts, augment semantic descriptions and bind object attributes. The obtained
control signals are injected into the denoising network to refocus and enhance
attention maps according to novel sampling constraints. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that LLM\_Control achieves
competitive synthesis quality compared to other state-of-the-art methods across
various pre-trained T2I models. It is noteworthy that LLM\_Control allows the
challenging input conditions on which most of the existing methods

Conclusion: UniCT Depth通过有效融合事件和图像数据，显著提升了深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a crucial role in 3D scene understanding and is
extensively used in a wide range of vision tasks. Image-based methods struggle
in challenging scenarios, while event cameras offer high dynamic range and
temporal resolution but face difficulties with sparse data. Combining event and
image data provides significant advantages, yet effective integration remains
challenging. Existing CNN-based fusion methods struggle with occlusions and
depth disparities due to limited receptive fields, while Transformer-based
fusion methods often lack deep modality interaction. To address these issues,
we propose UniCT Depth, an event-image fusion method that unifies CNNs and
Transformers to model local and global features. We propose the
Convolution-compensated ViT Dual SA (CcViT-DA) Block, designed for the encoder,
which integrates Context Modeling Self-Attention (CMSA) to capture spatial
dependencies and Modal Fusion Self-Attention (MFSA) for effective cross-modal
fusion. Furthermore, we design the tailored Detail Compensation Convolution
(DCC) Block to improve texture details and enhances edge representations.
Experiments show that UniCT Depth outperforms existing image, event, and
fusion-based monocular depth estimation methods across key metrics.

Result: 在工业和医疗数据集上展示了强大的零/少样本检测能力和泛化性。

Conclusion: AF-CLIP在零/少样本异常检测中表现优异，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and
medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training
samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent
efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task,
they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies,
reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused
CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local
defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes
anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both
class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for
precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve
detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial
aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.
Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts
that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on
auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates
strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot
scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial
and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our
proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Faustinaqq/AF-CLIP.

Abstract: Recent research leveraging large-scale pretrained diffusion models has
demonstrated the potential of using diffusion features to establish semantic
correspondences in images. Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based
techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud
registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from
depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for
a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud
into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from
a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are
then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to
establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging
these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved
registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not
only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques
but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper),
text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio

projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and
finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a
shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of
model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out
movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our
final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test
split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place
for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would
have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features
from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture
consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases.
However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and
traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a
method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images,
eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a
two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a
classification model on segmentation masks, followed by fine-tuning on
grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an
ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and
an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming
individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying
the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated
CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or
scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid
and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases
that often demand urgent care.

Abstract: The ability to abstract complex 3D environments into simplified and
structured representations is crucial across various domains. 3D semantic scene
graphs (SSGs) achieve this by representing objects as nodes and their
interrelationships as edges, facilitating high-level scene understanding.
Existing methods for 3D SSG generation, however, face significant challenges,
including high computational demands and non-incremental processing that hinder
their suitability for real-time open-world applications. To address this issue,
we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph
Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG
generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and
represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions. This framework eliminates the
dependency on precise and computationally-intensive point cloud processing.
Furthermore, we extend the Replica dataset with inter-object relationship
annotations, creating the ReplicaSSG dataset for comprehensive evaluation of
FROSS. The experimental results from evaluations on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG
datasets show that FROSS can achieve superior performance while operating
significantly faster than prior 3D SSG generation methods. Our implementation

Conclusion: 该方法通过多任务预测和血管特征分析，提升了CVD风险评估的准确性和临床价值。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide,
requiring urgent development of effective risk assessment methods for timely
intervention. While current research has introduced non-invasive and efficient
approaches to predict CVD risk from retinal imaging with deep learning models,
the commonly used fundus photographs and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
fail to capture detailed vascular features critical for CVD assessment compared
with OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Moreover, existing methods typically
classify CVD risk only as high or low, without providing a deeper analysis on
CVD-related blood factor conditions, thus limiting prediction accuracy and
clinical utility. As a result, we propose a novel multi-purpose paradigm of CVD
risk assessment that jointly performs CVD risk and CVD-related condition
prediction, aligning with clinical experiences. Based on this core idea, we
introduce OCTA-CVD, the first OCTA dataset for CVD risk assessment, and a
Vessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement
(VAMPIRE) based on OCTA enface images. Our proposed model aims to extract
crucial vascular characteristics through two key components: (1) a Mamba-Based
Directional (MBD) Module that captures fine-grained vascular trajectory
features and (2) an Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) Module that
incorporates comprehensive vessel morphology knowledge. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can surpass standard classification backbones,
OCTA-based detection methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models. Our codes
and the collected OCTA-CVD dataset are available at

TL;DR: RICE提出了一种增强区域级视觉和OCR能力的新方法，通过构建大规模候选区域数据集和设计统一的区域聚类判别损失，显著提升了密集预测任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言对比模型（如CLIP和SigLIP）依赖全局表示，限制了其在密集预测任务（如定位、OCR和分割）中的效果。

Method: 构建十亿级候选区域数据集，提出Region Transformer层提取区域语义，设计统一的区域聚类判别损失以联合支持对象和OCR学习。

Result: RICE在分割、密集检测和多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉感知任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RICE通过区域级表示学习显著提升了密集预测任务的性能，并发布了预训练模型。

Abstract: Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of
downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as
CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale
vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains
their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and
segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster
Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR
capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and
propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We
further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly
supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework,
enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.
Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods
on tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The pre-trained models have been
released at https://github.com/deepglint/MVT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在连续数据流中仅能获取单个样本时如何有效利用查询决策的挑战，同时满足延迟和内存限制。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动驾驶系统和医疗诊断等安全关键应用提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference
by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in
downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more
general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a
continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring
an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To
tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that
adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike
prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our
approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample
per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active
querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a
class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design
choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework
provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in
safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical
diagnostics.

Abstract: Recently, transfer learning and self-supervised learning have gained
significant attention within the medical field due to their ability to mitigate
the challenges posed by limited data availability, improve model
generalisation, and reduce computational expenses. Transfer learning and
self-supervised learning hold immense potential for advancing medical research.
However, it is crucial to recognise that transfer learning and self-supervised
learning architectures exhibit distinct advantages and limitations, manifesting
variations in accuracy, training speed, and robustness. This paper compares the
performance and robustness of transfer learning and self-supervised learning in
the medical field. Specifically, we pre-trained two models using the same
source domain datasets with different pre-training methods and evaluated them
on small-sized medical datasets to identify the factors influencing their final
performance. We tested data with several common issues in medical domains, such
as data imbalance, data scarcity, and domain mismatch, through comparison
experiments to understand their impact on specific pre-trained models. Finally,
we provide recommendations to help users apply transfer learning and
self-supervised learning methods in medical areas, and build more convenient
and efficient deployment strategies.

*Ze Rong,ZiYue Zhao,Zhaoxin Wang,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaRMamba通过多尺度频率变换模块和自监督重建辅助编码器，解决了医学图像分割中的高频信息丢失和空间结构退化问题，显著提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临模糊边界、高频细节丢失和长程结构建模困难等挑战，现有方法如Vision Mamba虽能建模全局依赖，但破坏了局部像素邻接关系，导致高频信息丢失和空间结构退化。

Method: 提出FaRMamba，包含多尺度频率变换模块（MSFM）恢复高频信息，以及自监督重建辅助编码器（SSRAE）重建2D空间相关性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，FaRMamba优于现有CNN-Transformer混合模型和Mamba变体，边界精度、细节保留和全局一致性表现更优。

Conclusion: FaRMamba为医学图像分割提供了灵活的频率感知框架，直接解决了核心挑战。

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion
boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in
modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs
one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global
dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch
tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a
low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information
Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation
(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose
FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through
two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)
restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing
multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A
Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level
reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial
correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive
evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg
endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive
CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior
boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without
prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible
frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly
mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督方法，通过减少模型对EOS标记的偏见，生成长度更长、细节更丰富的图像描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）在图像描述任务中表现良好，但生成的描述往往简短且缺乏细节。研究发现，这是由于交叉熵训练中引入的对EOS标记的偏见导致的。

Method: 提出了一种无监督方法，通过减少模型对EOS标记的偏见，鼓励生成更长的描述，无需复杂的奖励函数或监督数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著增加了描述长度和相关细节，尽管幻觉率也有所上升。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，适用于任何预训练模型，能够显著提升图像描述的细节丰富度。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image
captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing
short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped
with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex
reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we
identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)
token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an
unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token
prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more
detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or
supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable
to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments
with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a
substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an
expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

Conclusion: KB-DMGen有效提升人像生成的全局质量和姿态准确性，代码将公开。

Abstract: Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human
image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. In portrait
generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are
crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the
accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire
image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we
propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human
image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to
enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to
maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the
importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on
the HumanArt dataset. The code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在复杂提示下生成图像时缺乏风格一致性和空间连贯性，限制了可控内容生成的实用性。

Method: LPA方法将提示分解为内容和风格标记，并在生成过程的不同阶段选择性注入U-Net的注意力层。

Result: 在自定义的50个风格丰富提示的基准测试中，LPA在CLIP分数和风格一致性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LPA为可控、表达力强的扩散模型生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image
generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural
language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving
multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the
generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting
their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper,
we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt
Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style
tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at
different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in
the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic
consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich
prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including
Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach
outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics,
offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based
generation.

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，HDST显著提升了去噪性能并保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为高光谱图像及其他高维视觉数据中的复杂噪声耦合问题提供了新的见解和通用框架。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image denoising faces the challenge of multi-dimensional
coupling of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference.
Existing deep learning methods mostly focus on RGB images and struggle to
effectively handle the unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex
noise distributions of hyperspectral images (HSI). This paper proposes an HSI
denoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),
based on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving
three-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel
domains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)
introducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract
cross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a
dynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain
texture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating
mechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers
capture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep
layers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.
Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST
significantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational
efficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research
provides new insights and a universal framework for addressing complex noise
coupling issues in HSI and other high-dimensional visual data. The code is

Motivation: 内上髁撕脱常见于棒球运动员，表现为骨骼轮廓的间断。学习正常骨骼的结构和连续性对检测此类异常至关重要。

Method: 采用掩码自编码器框架，学习正常骨骼结构的连续性，并在撕脱部位尝试重建正常结构。

Conclusion: 该方法通过重建误差有效检测内上髁撕脱，数据集已公开。

Abstract: This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial
epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal
cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players,
involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in
bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone
is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a
masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns
the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the
model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large
reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a
novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball
players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method
outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an
image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at:

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards
language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with
sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited
representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM,
a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic
resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we
introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that
adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural
complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for
Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic
representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud
feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms
conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and
demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation
models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such
as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in
behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in
the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In
this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human
brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that
integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a
Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move
in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd
awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist
in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent
throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain.
Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and
plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如Youtube-VIS-19/-21和OVIS，AP分别达到54.3、49.4和37.0。

Conclusion: Local2Global框架简单高效，显著提升了在线视频分割的性能。

Abstract: Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and
capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications.
However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge,
especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation,
abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an
online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art
performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion.
Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel
sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial
features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal
representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer
decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries.
This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame
information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth
transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the
segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory
mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS
datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training,
surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve
54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset
respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.

Conclusion: Mo-DsCC为智能农业提供了实用工具，并为学术界和工业界带来新思路。

Abstract: Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture
which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning
approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which
offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However,
most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the
effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on
prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a
new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which
weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output
layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified
VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of
classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform
intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc.
Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label
(Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves
better accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the
application of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to
benefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by
exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs.
However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by
resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To
address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network
(WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different
cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based
multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low
and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across
modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination
variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the
representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or
misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection.
Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate
that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal
object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical
applicability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GT-mean loss的新损失函数，用于解决低光照图像增强（LLIE）中亮度不匹配的问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在监督式低光照图像增强研究中，增强图像与真实图像之间的亮度不匹配问题被忽视，影响了模型训练效果。

Method: 提出GT-mean loss，从概率角度直接建模图像均值，灵活扩展现有损失函数，计算成本低。

Result: 实验表明，GT-mean loss的引入在不同方法和数据集上均能带来性能提升。

Conclusion: GT-mean loss是一种简单有效的解决方案，解决了亮度不匹配问题，提升了监督式LLIE模型的性能。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visual quality of
images captured under poor lighting conditions. In supervised LLIE research,
there exists a significant yet often overlooked inconsistency between the
overall brightness of an enhanced image and its ground truth counterpart,
referred to as brightness mismatch in this study. Brightness mismatch
negatively impact supervised LLIE models by misleading model training. However,
this issue is largely neglected in current research. In this context, we
propose the GT-mean loss, a simple yet effective loss function directly
modeling the mean values of images from a probabilistic perspective. The
GT-mean loss is flexible, as it extends existing supervised LLIE loss functions
into the GT-mean form with minimal additional computational costs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of the GT-mean loss results in
consistent performance improvements across various methods and datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量化的视觉语言模型数据过滤框架，通过小型VLM评估和过滤训练样本，提升数据质量，效果优于大规模噪声数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）需要高质量数据，但现有方法依赖额外模块或大规模噪声数据，效率低且成本高。

Method: 使用小型VLM对图像和文本质量及对齐性进行评估和过滤，无需额外模块。

Result: 过滤后的数据集性能优于或等同于大规模噪声数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建高质量视觉语言训练数据提供了轻量且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models
by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and
significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including
visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical
evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training
examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the
quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data
filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality
image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters
potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.
Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on
top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent
evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates
the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model
efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text
alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that
datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on
par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through
high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust
solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\
\textbf{Availability and implementation:} Our compact VLM filtration model,
training data, utility scripts, and Supplementary data (Appendices) are freely

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动画着色在动画制作中至关重要，但现有方法难以实现颜色准确性和时间一致性。

Method: 提出AnimeColor框架，结合DiT和两个关键组件（HCE和LCG），通过多阶段训练策略优化参考图像的颜色信息利用。

Result: 实验表明，AnimeColor在颜色准确性、草图对齐、时间一致性和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AnimeColor不仅推动了动画着色技术的进步，还为工业应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Animation colorization plays a vital role in animation production, yet
existing methods struggle to achieve color accuracy and temporal consistency.
To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AnimeColor}, a novel
reference-based animation colorization framework leveraging Diffusion
Transformers (DiT). Our approach integrates sketch sequences into a DiT-based
video diffusion model, enabling sketch-controlled animation generation. We
introduce two key components: a High-level Color Extractor (HCE) to capture
semantic color information and a Low-level Color Guider (LCG) to extract
fine-grained color details from reference images. These components work
synergistically to guide the video diffusion process. Additionally, we employ a
multi-stage training strategy to maximize the utilization of reference image
color information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnimeColor
outperforms existing methods in color accuracy, sketch alignment, temporal
consistency, and visual quality. Our framework not only advances the state of
the art in animation colorization but also provides a practical solution for
industrial applications. The code will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多模态提示的身份感知体育视频描述方法（LLM-IAVC），通过提取球员相关信息和视频内容生成描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常忽略球员身份，导致描述不准确。本文旨在通过视觉识别球员身份，提升描述的准确性。

Method: 设计了身份相关信息提取模块（IRIEM）和视觉上下文学习模块（VCLM），结合大语言模型（LLM）生成描述。

Result: 在NBA-Identity和VC-NBA-2022数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: LLM-IAVC通过多模态信息融合，有效提升了身份感知视频描述的性能。

Abstract: Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet
overlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods
integrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player
identities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent
of the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt
generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which
focuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.
Specifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is
designed to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a
player identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player
names, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player
features with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual
context learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context
information. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the
multimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the
generation of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we
construct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware
basketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event
types. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate
that our proposed model achieves advanced performance. Code and dataset are

TL;DR: 论文提出PUMPS，一种针对TPC数据的自编码器架构，用于解决运动数据在骨架间迁移的兼容性问题，并在运动合成任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于骨架比例或结构差异，运动数据难以跨骨架迁移，TPC作为兼容性表示但缺乏直接学习能力，因此需要TPC数据合成能力。

Method: 提出PUMPS架构，通过帧级点云特征向量和潜在高斯噪声向量实现TPC重建，并引入线性分配优化重建过程。

Result: PUMPS在运动预测、过渡生成和关键帧插值任务中表现优异，无需监督即可匹配SOTA性能；在微调任务中优于其他方法。

Conclusion: PUMPS为TPC数据提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，解决了运动合成的兼容性和性能问题。

Abstract: Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone
hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard
to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion
synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible
motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for
compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data
synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges
regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore,
we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS
independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors,
from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian
noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based
point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of
expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these
latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing
motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these
pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset
supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion
denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without
deviating from its generalist architecture.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种空间评估流程和基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）的空间理解能力，发现其表现远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在空间关系识别和运动感知方面的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建合成数据集，将空间理解分为绝对空间理解和3D空间理解两类，并测试多个先进VLMs。

Result: 人类表现接近完美，而VLMs仅在简单任务上达到人类水平，复杂任务表现显著较差。

Conclusion: VLMs的空间理解能力有待提升，合成数据集为低成本测试提供了可能。

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot
manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains
underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships
and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation
pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize
spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,
which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an
object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement
and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the
generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset
contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and
observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial
understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve
near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level
performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the
performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the
best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on
multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on

Conclusion: 计算机视觉方法在手语数据集上能有效分类面部表情，下半脸识别更优，颜色归一化方法显著提升性能。

Abstract: The goal of this investigation is to quantify to what extent computer vision
methods can correctly classify facial expressions on a sign language dataset.
We extend our experiments by recognizing expressions using only the upper or
lower part of the face, which is needed to further investigate the difference
in emotion manifestation between hearing and deaf subjects. To take into
account the peculiar color profile of a dataset, our method introduces a color
normalization stage based on histogram equalization and fine-tuning. The
results show the ability to correctly recognize facial expressions with 83.8%
mean sensitivity and very little variance (.042) among classes. Like for
humans, recognition of expressions from the lower half of the face (79.6%) is
higher than that from the upper half (77.9%). Noticeably, the classification
accuracy from the upper half of the face is higher than human level.

Abstract: We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with
online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed
to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and
RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically,
our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We
expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer
video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level
Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense
temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion
trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality
Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn
cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently
compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training
manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following
benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for
the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is
leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that
require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates
the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive
experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker}
achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，检测mAP达70.93%（MFNet）和45.14%（DroneVehicle）。

Conclusion: MoCTEFuse通过动态光照适应和多级融合显著提升图像融合性能。

Abstract: While illumination changes inevitably affect the quality of infrared and
visible image fusion, many outstanding methods still ignore this factor and
directly merge the information from source images, leading to modality bias in
the fused results. To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion
network called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral
Transformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object
contrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert
subnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB). Guided
by the illumination gating signals, CTFB dynamically switches between the
primary and auxiliary modalities as well as assigning them corresponding
weights with its asymmetric cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, it is stacked
at multiple stages to progressively aggregate and refine modality-specific and
cross-modality information. To facilitate robust training, we propose a
competitive loss function that integrates illumination distributions with three
levels of sub-loss terms. Extensive experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle,
MSRS, TNO and RoadScene datasets show MoCTEFuse's superior fusion performance.
Finally, it achieves the best detection mean Average Precision (mAP) of 70.93%
on the MFNet dataset and 45.14% on the DroneVehicle dataset. The code and model
are released at https://github.com/Bitlijinfu/MoCTEFuse.

Conclusion: 论文验证了语义分割在非结构化驾驶环境中的有效性，为自动驾驶研究提供了实用参考。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and
they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding
the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its
competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress
that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating
every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene
comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous
Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable
areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has
been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled
on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more
challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on
unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this
paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models
have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean
Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and
SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the
dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five
models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the

Motivation: 大型基础模型（如SAM）在复杂任务中性能下降，现有适配器方法因特征提取受限效果有限。

Method: 利用小波变换提取多尺度高频特征，并引入复数适配器捕捉复数空间-频率信息。

Result: 在四项低层视觉任务中，SAMwave显著优于现有适配方法，且适用于SAM和SAM2两种架构。

Conclusion: SAMwave高效、灵活且可解释，为适应分割任务提供了一种新方法。

Abstract: The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances
in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image
segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.
However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when
applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods
typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks
and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.
However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due
to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we
propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that
utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency
features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters
capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex
wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients,
SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense
prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks
demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods.
This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones
and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the
efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for
adapting segment anything models.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）发展迅速，但在空间推理任务中仍表现不佳，需要一种方法来提升其能力。

Method: SpatialVTS方法分为空间视觉思考和空间文本思考两个阶段：视觉阶段生成与位置相关的特定标记，文本阶段基于视觉线索和对话进行长期推理。同时，对数据集进行人工修正和格式优化。

Conclusion: SpatialVTS通过双重思考机制和数据集优化，有效提升了空间推理能力，为VQA和机器人任务提供了更强大的支持。

Abstract: The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in
2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have
developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial
reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial
reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In
the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate
location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only
are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential
objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual
thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and
dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To
effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the
existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels
resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to
enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical
reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or
depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding
tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

This paper introduces SAViL-Det, a novel semantic-aware vision-language model

Furthermore, a text-to-pixel contrastive learning mechanism explicitly aligns
textual and corresponding visual pixel features. Extensive experiments on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像生成模型对提示词敏感、需要反复优化且缺乏明确反馈的问题，同时避免额外训练的限制。

Method: T2I-Copilot由三个代理组成：输入解析器、生成引擎和质量评估器，协作完成提示词标准化、模型选择和迭代优化。

Result: 在GenAI-Bench上，T2I-Copilot性能接近商业模型，成本仅为FLUX1.1-pro的16.59%，且显著优于其他开源模型。

Conclusion: T2I-Copilot通过多代理协作实现了高效、低成本的文本到图像生成，支持全自动和人工干预模式。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation
but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to
repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While
techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,
denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited
controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the
generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free
multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large
Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative
refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while
enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct
generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input
Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates
a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate
model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual
prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses
aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for
potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also
supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On
GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA
score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses
FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and

### [88] [MemoryTalker: Personalized Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation via Audio-Guided Stylization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20562)
*Hyung Kyu Kim,Sangmin Lee,Hak Gu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MemoryTalker提出了一种仅需音频输入即可生成逼真3D面部动画的方法，无需额外先验信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖额外先验信息（如说话者类别标签或3D面部网格）导致无法反映说话风格的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：1.记忆通用运动；2.通过音频驱动的说话风格特征进行个性化面部运动合成。

Result: 模型在定量、定性评估及用户研究中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemoryTalker在无需额外先验的情况下，实现了逼真且个性化的3D面部动画合成。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion
sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However,
previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or
additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the
speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we
propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion
synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize
usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages:
1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and
2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e.,
Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style
feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types
should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our
MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without
additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as
well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance
enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了多模态长上下文令牌压缩方法，按模态分类并提出未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理长上下文时面临计算复杂度高的问题，令牌压缩成为关键解决方案。

Method: 将现有方法按模态（图像、视频、音频）和机制（变换、相似性、注意力、查询）分类。

Result: 提供了全面的分类和结构化概述，并维护公开资源库以跟踪最新进展。

Conclusion: 令牌压缩是多模态长上下文处理的关键方向，需进一步研究以解决挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides,
largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex
contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy
audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it
introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic
complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate
these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical
approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and
inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis
of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression.
Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique
characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing
approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access
and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1)
image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data;
(2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in
dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal
and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven
categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying
mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based,
and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured
overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key
challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving
domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update
the latest advances in this promising area.

*Hyung Kyu Kim,Hak Gu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语音上下文感知的损失函数，用于改进语音驱动的3D面部动画的连续性和自然性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过逐帧对齐真实数据最小化重建损失，但忽略了面部运动的连续性，导致输出抖动且不自然。

Method: 提出了一种新的语音上下文感知损失函数，通过引入音素协同发音权重，根据面部运动的动态变化分配重要性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于传统重建损失。

Conclusion: 强调了在合成自然语音驱动3D面部动画中，显式建模语音上下文依赖音素的重要性。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements
synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction
loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise
approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to
jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we
propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the
influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme
coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based
on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually
consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the
conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics
and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling
phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D
facial animation. Project page: https://cau-irislab.github.io/interspeech25/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 矿区场景分类为地质环境监测和资源开发规划提供基础数据，但复杂空间布局和多尺度特征增加了分类难度。

Conclusion: 该模型通过全局和局部特征的融合，有效提升了矿区场景分类的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Scene classification of mining areas provides accurate foundational data for
geological environment monitoring and resource development planning. This study
fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene
classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification
lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By
extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively
reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of
the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion
model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into
a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)
Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale
features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale
features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)
Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention
weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,
ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area
are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to
fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It
fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene
information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and
classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss
computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall
accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models.
Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation
metrics.

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep
neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene
classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these
RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference
latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled
global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for
edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first
apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size.
Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge
devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C
model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental
results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and
over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high
classification accuracy.

TL;DR: MECo框架利用大型语言模型（LLMs）实现基于运动示例的语音同步手势生成，保留示例细节并提升控制粒度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过预定义标签或隐式伪标签控制手势生成，但牺牲了原始运动示例的丰富细节。

Method: 通过微调LLMs同时解析语音音频和运动示例，将运动示例作为显式查询上下文指导手势生成。

Result: 在FGD、运动多样性和示例-手势相似性三个指标上表现最优，支持多模态输入和身体部位细粒度控制。

Conclusion: MECo框架在保留示例细节的同时实现了语音同步手势的高质量生成，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The automatic generation of controllable co-speech gestures has recently
gained growing attention. While existing systems typically achieve gesture
control through predefined categorical labels or implicit pseudo-labels derived
from motion examples, these approaches often compromise the rich details
present in the original motion examples. We present MECo, a framework for
motion-example-controlled co-speech gesture generation by leveraging large
language models (LLMs). Our method capitalizes on LLMs' comprehension
capabilities through fine-tuning to simultaneously interpret speech audio and
motion examples, enabling the synthesis of gestures that preserve
example-specific characteristics while maintaining speech congruence. Departing
from conventional pseudo-labeling paradigms, we position motion examples as
explicit query contexts within the prompt structure to guide gesture
generation. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
across three metrics: Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and
example-gesture similarity. Furthermore, our framework enables granular control
of individual body parts and accommodates diverse input modalities including
motion clips, static poses, human video sequences, and textual descriptions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransPrune是一种无需训练的高效令牌修剪方法，通过令牌转移变化（TTV）和指令引导注意力（IGA）评估令牌重要性，显著降低计算成本，同时保持多模态性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）因视觉令牌数量庞大导致计算成本高，现有基于注意力的方法存在位置偏差等限制，需要更有效的令牌修剪方法。

Method: 提出TransPrune，结合TTV（衡量令牌表示的变化）和IGA（衡量指令对图像令牌的注意力）逐步修剪令牌。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，TransPrune保持与原始LVLMs相当的性能，同时减少超过一半的计算量；TTV单独使用也能达到与基于注意力的方法相当的效果。

Conclusion: TransPrune为令牌修剪提供了高效且无需训练的解决方案，TTV作为独立标准具有潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but
face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens,
motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge
lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches
rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they
inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this
work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token
transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations
provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we
propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.
Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their
importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which
measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token
representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how
strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal
performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight
benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV
alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,
achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be
made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at

Motivation: 理解和预测多人游戏中玩家的移动对于实现玩家模仿机器人导航、预判机器人控制、策略推荐和实时玩家行为分析等用例至关重要。

Method: 使用基于U-Net的方法计算端点位置概率热图，结合多模态特征编码器和多头注意力机制，有效利用图像输入、数值和分类特征以及动态游戏数据。

Result: 该架构能够高效利用多模态游戏状态，为依赖未来玩家位置的下游任务（如玩家预测机器人行为或玩家异常检测）奠定基础。

Conclusion: 提出的技术为多种依赖未来玩家位置的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial
for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot
control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics.
However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational
freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that
make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper
presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a
dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint
location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder.
The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of
features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture
makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs,
numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently,
the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that
rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot
behavior or player anomaly detection.

Motivation: 高清地图对自动驾驶至关重要，但现有方法未能充分利用时序信息或计算开销过大。

Method: 提出MambaMap框架，结合记忆库和门控机制，动态更新BEV特征和实例查询，并引入多方向时空扫描策略。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MambaMap通过高效时序建模，显著提升了地图构建的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, as they
provide precise road information for downstream tasks. Recent advances
highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like
occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail
to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational
overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose
MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features
in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically,
MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from
historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to
improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a
gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of
map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design
innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to
enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies
significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring
robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and
Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges. Source

Abstract: Emotion recognition from physiological data is crucial for mental health
assessment, yet it faces two significant challenges: incomplete multi-modal
signals and interference from body movements and artifacts. This paper presents
a novel Multi-Masked Querying Network (MMQ-Net) to address these issues by
integrating multiple querying mechanisms into a unified framework.
Specifically, it uses modality queries to reconstruct missing data from

MMQ-Net compared to existing approaches, particularly under high levels of data

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（GS）在高质量场景重建中表现优异，但训练过程收敛慢，主要由于高斯原语的空间分布和密度化效率不足。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化高斯原语的分布和训练策略，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅的效率和质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
high-quality scene reconstruction, offering compelling rendering quality.
However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to
inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian
primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and
clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles
in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon
this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which
facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space,
promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the
proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian
primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine
multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based
on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary
Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on
MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our
approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with
fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩适应方法在训练时投影矩阵不受限制，导致表示冗余和特征适应效果下降。

Method: ReSoRA通过理论分解低秩子矩阵为多个等价子空间，并对不同投影的特征分布施加去冗余约束。

Result: 实验表明ReSoRA能提升现有PETL方法在各种数据集和架构上的性能。

Conclusion: ReSoRA可作为训练监督无缝集成到现有方法中，无需额外推理成本。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability
in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable
parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection
matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation
redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the
resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting
the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and
generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose
ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces
and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation.
Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into
multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy
constraints to the feature distributions across different projections.
Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently
facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and
datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification
benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly
integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no
additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation,
necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and
interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have
significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks,
such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately
identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains
relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife
monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale
dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our
dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of
indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968
species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with
species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained
trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike
existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal
appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification,
detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more
detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively
evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal
identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at

Result: 在五个公开MI数据集上，MIRepNet表现优于其他EEG模型，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MIRepNet为MI范式提供了高效、适应性强的解决方案，适用于少量数据场景。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the
brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn
generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these
approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological
distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical
BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke
rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data
acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model
tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG
preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel
template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations.
Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines
self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification,
facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI
tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five
public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and
generalized EEG models. Our code will be available on

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and
events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to
extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For
instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but
it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to
expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the
hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on
their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill
level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical
manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based
vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D
grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset
of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we
develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and
classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of
measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding
correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.
Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known
classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)
and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分类中多模态数据对齐和标签稀缺的问题，提出一种轻量且高效的方法。

Method: 引入Modality-Spectral Adapters (MSA)压缩高维输入，以及Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA)自监督机制对齐异构模态。

Conclusion: L-MCAT是一种高效、轻量且鲁棒的遥感图像分类方法，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: We propose the Lightweight Multimodal Contrastive Attention Transformer
(L-MCAT), a novel transformer-based framework for label-efficient remote
sensing image classification using unpaired multimodal satellite data. L-MCAT
introduces two core innovations: (1) Modality-Spectral Adapters (MSA) that
compress high-dimensional sensor inputs into a unified embedding space, and (2)
Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA), a contrastive self-supervised
mechanism integrated into the attention layers to align heterogeneous
modalities without pixel-level correspondence or labels. L-MCAT achieves 95.4%
overall accuracy on the SEN12MS dataset using only 20 labels per class,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while using 47x fewer parameters and
23x fewer FLOPs than MCTrans. It maintains over 92% accuracy even under 50%
spatial misalignment, demonstrating robustness for real-world deployment. The
model trains end-to-end in under 5 hours on a single consumer GPU.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了合成数据在训练人脸识别模型中的潜力，评估了其对性能和偏见的双重影响，发现平衡的合成数据集（如SD35生成）在减少偏见方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究合成数据是否能在保持高准确性的同时实现公平性，解决人脸识别系统中的偏见问题。

Method: 生成平衡的合成数据集FairFaceGen，结合多种身份增强方法，并在标准及挑战性基准上评估性能和偏见。

Result: 合成数据在IJB-B/C上泛化能力不及真实数据，但SD35生成的平衡数据集在减少偏见方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 合成数据（尤其是SD35生成的数据）在构建更公平的人脸识别系统中具有潜力，但需关注增强的数量和质量。

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face
recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy
compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions
remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with
synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias
and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen,
using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable
Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation
methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity
count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when
evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging
IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our
results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real
datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic
datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias
mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class
augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings
provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic
data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为可控特征白化的框架，通过消除目标与偏差特征之间的线性相关性，显著减轻了深度神经网络中的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能的广泛应用，开发可信赖的人工智能变得重要。然而，深度神经网络容易学习数据集中的虚假相关性，影响了可靠性。

Method: 通过量化目标与偏差特征之间的线性相关性（协方差矩阵），并利用白化模块消除这种相关性，避免了建模高阶依赖的复杂性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（Corrupted CIFAR-10、Biased FFHQ、WaterBirds和Celeb-A）上验证了方法的优越性，显著减轻了偏差。

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需正则化或对抗学习，通过调整加权系数有效平衡了算法效用与公平性，同时支持两种公平性标准（人口统计平等和均等机会）。

Abstract: As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of
trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent
studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious
correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a
simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We
quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the
covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results
systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features
fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while
avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization
terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in
practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity
and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the
re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off
between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting
coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing
approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ,
WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于测试时训练（TTT）的假新闻视频检测框架（T$^3$SVFND），通过自监督辅助任务增强模型对紧急新闻的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻视频检测方法因不同事件间分布偏移而泛化性不足，尤其在紧急新闻上表现不佳。

Method: 设计基于掩码语言建模（MLM）的自监督辅助任务，结合多模态（音频和视频）上下文信息预测掩码词，并在测试时训练阶段通过辅助任务适应测试数据分布。

Result: 在公开基准测试中表现优异，尤其在紧急新闻检测上效果显著。

Conclusion: T$^3$SVFND框架有效提升了假新闻视频检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The existing methods for fake news videos detection may not be generalized,
because there is a distribution shift between short video news of different
events, and the performance of such techniques greatly drops if news records
are coming from emergencies. We propose a new fake news videos detection
framework (T$^3$SVFND) using Test-Time Training (TTT) to alleviate this
limitation, enhancing the robustness of fake news videos detection.
Specifically, we design a self-supervised auxiliary task based on Mask Language
Modeling (MLM) that masks a certain percentage of words in text and predicts
these masked words by combining contextual information from different
modalities (audio and video). In the test-time training phase, the model adapts
to the distribution of test data through auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments
on the public benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model,
especially for the detection of emergency news.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病全球患者超过5500万，现有诊断方法无法同时满足准确性、泛化性、鲁棒性和可解释性需求，限制了临床可靠性。

Method: OmniBrain整合多模态数据（MRI、放射组学、基因表达、临床数据），采用统一模型结合交叉注意力和模态丢弃技术。

Result: 在ANMerge数据集上准确率达92.2±2.4%，在MRI-only ADNI数据集上达70.4±2.7%，优于单模态和多模态方法。可解释性分析揭示了与神经病理相关的脑区和基因。

Conclusion: OmniBrain为阿尔茨海默病诊断提供了鲁棒、可解释且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide and is projected
to more than double by 2050, necessitating rapid, accurate, and scalable
diagnostics. However, existing approaches are limited because they cannot
achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets,
robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This
inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their
reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework
that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using
a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves
$92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only
ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior
multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically
relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a
robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's
diagnosis.

*Qiaosi Yi,Shuai Li,Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Yuhui Wu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TVT（Transfer VAE Training）的策略，通过将8倍下采样的VAE转换为4倍下采样的VAE，并结合预训练的UNet，显著提升了图像超分辨率中精细结构的重建能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于稳定扩散（SD）模型的图像超分辨率方法因VAE的激进下采样（如8倍）导致精细结构（如小字符和纹理）重建效果不佳。

Method: 采用TVT策略，分两步训练4倍下采样的VAE：先基于原始VAE编码器输出训练4倍解码器，再固定解码器训练4倍编码器。同时优化网络架构以减少计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，TVT方法显著改善了精细结构的保留效果，且计算量低于当前最优的一步扩散模型。

Conclusion: TVT策略有效解决了SD模型中VAE下采样导致的精细结构损失问题，同时降低了计算成本，为图像超分辨率提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been
achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one
critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine
structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive
resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.
One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;
however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while
mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address
these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the
8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the
pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the
output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder
while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the
new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing
image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and
compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the
computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.
Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves
fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based
methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion
models. The official code can be found at https://github.com/Joyies/TVT.

TL;DR: 论文提出SCORPION数据集和SimCons框架，旨在解决计算病理学中模型在不同扫描仪间的泛化问题，提升模型一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中，不同扫描仪导致的图像差异影响模型性能，需解决扫描仪泛化问题以确保临床应用的可靠性。

Method: 引入SCORPION数据集（480个组织样本，每个用5种扫描仪扫描）和SimCons框架（结合增强技术和一致性损失）。

Result: SimCons在不影响任务性能的情况下提升了模型在不同扫描仪间的一致性。

Conclusion: SCORPION数据集和SimCons框架为研究社区提供了评估和改进模型一致性的关键资源，设定了新的可靠性测试标准。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical
challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in
Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus
calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world
adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per
institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on
scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on
standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during
training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same
tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset
explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.
SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding
2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the
isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of
model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.
Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines
augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to
explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons
improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising
task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing
SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for
evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a
new standard for reliability testing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWIFT是一种快速跨传感器适应框架，通过无监督采样和梯度分析，仅更新对域转移敏感的权重，显著减少适应时间并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在未见传感器数据上性能下降的问题，避免昂贵的全模型重训练或复杂架构设计。

Method: 使用无监督采样策略选择目标域中最具信息量的样本（3%），通过梯度分析识别并更新敏感权重。

Result: 适应时间从几小时缩短至约一分钟，性能优于直接迁移基线，甚至媲美全重训练。

Conclusion: SWIFT为跨传感器图像融合提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，性能达到新SOTA。

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images to generate high-resolution
multispectral (HRMS) images. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved
promising performance, they generally suffer from severe performance
degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Adapting these models
through full-scale retraining or designing more complex architectures is often
prohibitively expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address
this critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for
cross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast
Transfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based
on data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the
bias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\% of
the most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used
to probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior
of its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update
of only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a
plug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening
models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation
time from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
The adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines
but also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,
full retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor
pansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

TL;DR: HAMLET-FFD是一个基于认知启发的多模态学习框架，通过双向跨模态推理解决人脸伪造检测中的跨域泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸伪造技术的快速发展对检测方法提出了跨域泛化的挑战，传统方法难以学习域不变表示。

Method: HAMLET-FFD利用对比视觉-语言模型（如CLIP），通过知识精炼循环和双向融合机制，结合视觉证据与概念线索进行真实性评估。

Result: 实验表明HAMLET-FFD在多个基准测试中对未见过的伪造技术具有优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: HAMLET-FFD通过冻结预训练参数，保留了CLIP的原始能力，同时实现了高效的真实性评估。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical
challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional
methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn
domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired
Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this
challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive
vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge
refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual
evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key
innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity
embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while
modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive
prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with
semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD
freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves
CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior
generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual
analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct
representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

Motivation: 在动态场景中插入3D对象时，传统方法难以同时满足时间一致性和光照真实性，需要一种新的解决方案。

Method: 结合3D高斯散射（3DGS）和2D扩散模型，通过分离对象属性（如反照率、阴影、反射）并优化3DGS模型，实现时间一致性和光照真实性的平衡。

Result: 该方法在动态手腕场景中成功插入手镯，实现了时间一致性和光照真实性的双重目标。

Conclusion: 该混合方法为视频对象插入提供了一种高效且真实的解决方案，结合了3D和2D技术的优势。

Abstract: Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer
graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video
composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains
difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,
perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have
shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with
maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D
rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in
achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object
insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,
we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high
temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and
refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure
realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven
pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,
reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To
maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame
weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and
2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for
realistic and consistent video editing. Project Page:

Conclusion: PIVOTS为肝脏配准提供了高效解决方案，并公开了数据集和代码以促进公平比较。

Abstract: Non-rigid registration is essential for Augmented Reality guided laparoscopic
liver surgery by fusing preoperative information, such as tumor location and
vascular structures, into the limited intraoperative view, thereby enhancing
surgical navigation. A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of
intraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to
factors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and
tool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of
view due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these
challenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative
VOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds
as input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder
allows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel
deformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative
information interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We
train the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical
simulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real
datasets. Results demonstrate superior registration performance of our method
compared to baseline methods, exhibiting strong robustness against high amounts
of noise, large deformation, and various levels of intraoperative visibility.
We publish the training and test sets as evaluation benchmarks and call for a
fair comparison of liver registration methods with volume-to-surface data. Code

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled
photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve
multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural
speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess
both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for
region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1),
comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities
across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint
audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA
models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and
whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

Motivation: AR中的虚拟内容可能导致语义误解或用户错误，需要研究并检测视觉信息操纵攻击。

Method: 提出分类法将VIM攻击分为三类格式和三类目的，构建数据集AR-VIM，开发多模态框架VIM-Sense结合视觉语言模型和OCR分析。

Result: VIM-Sense在AR-VIM数据集上检测准确率达88.94%，平均延迟约7秒。

Conclusion: VIM-Sense能有效检测AR中的视觉信息操纵攻击，优于纯视觉或纯文本基线。

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or
harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In
this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR
where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but
impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into
three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes:
information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information.
Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452
raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world
AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning
framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character
recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack
detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only
and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency
of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a
real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本安全机制无法直接应用于视觉模态，导致LVLMs容易受到有害图像输入的影响。

Method: 引入安全张量（可训练的输入向量），通过文本或视觉模态在推理时应用，利用包含恶意、对比良性及普通良性样本的数据集进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，安全张量显著提升了LVLMs拒绝有害视觉输入的能力，同时不影响良性任务的性能。

Conclusion: 安全张量成功将文本安全机制扩展到视觉模态，激活了语言模块的“安全层”，从而有效保护LVLMs免受有害视觉输入的影响。

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models
(LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety
mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual
modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this
cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors
applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These
tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without
modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset
containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive
benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the
purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)
general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results
demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance
LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining
near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards
hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully
activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs,
thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于通用预训练模型，难以捕捉面部美感的主观和细微特征。

Method: 使用扩散变换器在无标签面部数据集上自监督预训练，再微调轻量回归头。

Result: 在FBP5500基准上达到PCC 0.932，显著优于之前的方法。

Conclusion: 生成预训练策略是关键，能提取更适合主观视觉任务的特征。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to
its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human
perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or
standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification
(e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly
aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a
superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a
Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through
a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the
fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and
structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the
pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a
backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being
fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP,
sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art
based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that
our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance
leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for
subjective visual tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MagicAnime数据集和基准测试，用于支持高质量卡通动画的多模态控制生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卡通动画生成面临复杂非人类角色、多样化动作和精细情感的挑战，且缺乏大规模标注数据。

Method: 构建了包含40万视频片段的多模态数据集MagicAnime，并设计了MagicAnime-Bench基准测试。

Result: 在四项任务中验证了数据集支持高保真、细粒度和可控生成的有效性。

Conclusion: MagicAnime数据集和基准测试为卡通动画生成提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Generating high-quality cartoon animations multimodal control is challenging
due to the complexity of non-human characters, stylistically diverse motions
and fine-grained emotions. There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos
and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has
exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely
scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes
compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the
MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal
dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the
benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video
generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation,
12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of
video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build
a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to
support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive
experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven
face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation,
validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and
controllable generation.

TL;DR: ModalFormer是一个多模态低光图像增强框架，通过整合九种辅助模态信息，结合跨模态Transformer和辅助子网络，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光图像增强任务面临噪声、细节丢失和对比度差等问题，现有方法仅依赖RGB图像的像素级变换，忽略了多模态上下文信息。

Method: 提出ModalFormer框架，包含跨模态Transformer（CM-T）和多个辅助子网络，利用CM-MSA机制融合RGB数据与多模态特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ModalFormer通过多模态信息融合，显著提升了低光图像增强的效果。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental yet challenging task due
to the presence of noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast in images captured
under insufficient lighting conditions. Recent methods often rely solely on
pixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual
information available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we
present ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that
fully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer
(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating
multimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to
multimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal
Multi-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB
data with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,
segmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate
information-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in
LLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available at

Motivation: 解决LiDAR自动标注方法在稀疏性、遮挡和语义粒度有限方面的不足。

Method: 融合LiDAR和相机数据，利用视觉语言模型进行开放词汇标注和点云域检测质量优化。

Conclusion: VESPA在可扩展的3D场景理解中表现出色，为自动标注提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual
annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its
high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable
alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal
human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric
information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as
sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these
methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic
granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal
autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the
semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection
quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of
novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring
ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP
of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object
detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding.
Code will be available upon acceptance.

Abstract: This work summarises and reports the results of the second Presentation
Attack Detection competition on ID cards. This new version includes new
elements compared to the previous one. (1) An automatic evaluation platform was
enabled for automatic benchmarking; (2) Two tracks were proposed in order to
evaluate algorithms and datasets, respectively; and (3) A new ID card dataset
was shared with Track 1 teams to serve as the baseline dataset for the training
and optimisation. The Hochschule Darmstadt, Fraunhofer-IGD, and Facephi company
jointly organised this challenge. 20 teams were registered, and 74 submitted
models were evaluated. For Track 1, the "Dragons" team reached first place with
an Average Ranking and Equal Error rate (EER) of AV-Rank of 40.48% and 11.44%
EER, respectively. For the more challenging approach in Track 2, the "Incode"
team reached the best results with an AV-Rank of 14.76% and 6.36% EER,
improving on the results of the first edition of 74.30% and 21.87% EER,
respectively. These results suggest that PAD on ID cards is improving, but it
is still a challenging problem related to the number of images, especially of
bona fide images.

Conclusion: 研究成功开发了高效ISL翻译系统，为聋哑社区提供了可靠的沟通解决方案。

Abstract: Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through
hand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as
sign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand
gestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &
mute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human
interaction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant
barriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation
technologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the
Indian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine
learning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf
& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL
are less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a
robust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &
demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the
nuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is
rigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1
score, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world
applications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe
for precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of
dynamic gestures. This paper provides a detailed account of the model's
architecture, the data preprocessing pipeline & the classification methodology.
The research elaborates the model architecture, preprocessing & classification
methodologies for enhancing communication in deaf & mute communities.

Conclusion: 该方法为生物识别设备的功能扩展提供了新方向，尤其在数据有限的情况下表现出潜力。

Abstract: Biometric capture devices have been utilised to estimate a person's alertness
through near-infrared iris images, expanding their use beyond just biometric
recognition. However, capturing a substantial number of corresponding images
related to alcohol consumption, drug use, and sleep deprivation to create a
dataset for training an AI model presents a significant challenge. Typically, a
large quantity of images is required to effectively implement a deep learning
approach. Currently, training downstream models with a huge number of images
based on foundational models provides a real opportunity to enhance this area,
thanks to the generalisation capabilities of self-supervised models. This work
examines the application of deep learning and foundational models in predicting
fitness for duty, which is defined as the subject condition related to
determining the alertness for work.

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the effectiveness of 3DMM for talking head synthesis
by jointly learning a 3D face reconstruction model and a talking head synthesis
model. This enables us to obtain a FACS-based blendshape representation of
facial expressions that is optimized for talking head synthesis. This contrasts
with previous methods that either fit 3DMM parameters to 2D landmarks or rely
on pretrained face reconstruction models. Not only does our approach increase
the quality of the generated face, but it also allows us to take advantage of
the blendshape representation to modify just the mouth region for the purpose
of audio-based lip-sync. To this end, we propose a novel lip-sync pipeline
that, unlike previous methods, decouples the original chin contour from the
lip-synced chin contour, and reduces flickering near the mouth.

Result: 在Infinity-2B中实现2倍加速且质量损失极小。

Conclusion: SparseVAR有效平衡了计算效率与图像质量，适用于高分辨率图像生成。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm,
exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over
traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by
progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the
computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge
due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce
SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction
that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without
requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation
that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality
in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring
tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale
prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on
high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing
lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving
the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled
anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while
maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable
acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to
a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.

Result: 实验证明该方法有效减少误诊，优先处理重要症状，并在多症状案例中验证了预测效果。

Conclusion: 新方法解决了MIL在临床中的优先级问题，提升了诊断准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool
within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high
performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches
for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that
exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL
models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation
of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two
hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The
proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and
employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate
clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with
real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces
misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.
Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and
qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with
multiple symptoms.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation
demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training
efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map
reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps
remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to
select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for
registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often
degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need
for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion
quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and
leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating
robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion
strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding.
Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For
registration, it achieves a 41.9\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring
more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB,
highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its
ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more
consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and
autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in
hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but
also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field
environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small
size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains
challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering
recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet
structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature
utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object
detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss
commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available
datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB
camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated
dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing.
Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an
mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%,
representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively,
over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set,
meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2
offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated
monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

Abstract: Capturing spatial context at multiple scales is crucial for deep
learning-based sea ice segmentation. However, the optimal specification of
spatial context based on observation resolution and task characteristics
remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of spatial context on
the segmentation of sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size
using a multi-task segmentation model. We implement Atrous Spatial Pyramid
Pooling with varying atrous rates to systematically control the receptive field
size of convolutional operations, and to capture multi-scale contextual
information. We explore the interactions between spatial context and feature
resolution for different sea ice properties and examine how spatial context
influences segmentation performance across different input feature combinations
from Sentinel-1 SAR and Advanced Microwave Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) for multi-task
mapping. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, we visualize how
atrous rates influence model decisions. Our findings indicate that smaller
receptive fields excel for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, while medium
receptive fields yield better performances for stage of development
segmentation and larger receptive fields often lead to diminished performances.
The fusion of SAR and AMSR2 enhances segmentation across all tasks. We
highlight the value of lower-resolution 18.7 and 36.5 GHz AMSR2 channels in sea
ice mapping. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate
spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties in sea
ice mapping. By systematically analyzing receptive field effects in a
multi-task setting, our study provides insights for optimizing deep learning
models in geospatial applications.

Abstract: Few-shot Learning (FSL), which endeavors to develop the generalization
ability for recognizing novel classes using only a few images, faces
significant challenges due to data scarcity. Recent CLIP-like methods based on
contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual
representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the
achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name
embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class
discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method
(BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive
learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior
knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image
representations, including both global category representation and the
patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel
multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate
multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant
retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property
descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token
learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate
that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative
class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成新视图时具有高保真度，并能产生更自然的多面光照和阴影效果。

Conclusion: 该框架在户外重光照任务中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework for outdoor relighting
that leverages intrinsic image decomposition to precisely integrate sunlight,
sky radiance, and indirect lighting from unconstrained photo collections.
Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a
single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading
manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved
through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction
method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based
supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically
interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a
ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with
competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces
more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects.

TL;DR: T2VParser提出了一种多视角语义表示方法，通过自适应分解标记实现文本与视频的精确对齐，解决了现有视频-文本匹配中的部分不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频通常比图像包含更丰富的信息，但现有视频-文本数据集的描述仅反映部分内容，导致匹配时的部分不对齐问题。直接对齐文本和视频表示会忽略信息的不等价性。

Method: 提出T2VParser，通过自适应分解标记（一组可学习的跨模态共享标记）提取多视角语义表示，实现自适应语义对齐。

Result: 实验表明，T2VParser通过有效的跨模态内容分解实现了精确的部分对齐。

Conclusion: T2VParser在保留预训练模型知识的同时，解决了视频-文本匹配中的部分不对齐问题。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual
content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general
multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP,
existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text
tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In
current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of
the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.
Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations
can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.
In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic
representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment
rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding
representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition
Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities.
The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video
while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results
demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through
effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at

Result: VLMs在细粒度识别任务中表现不佳，尤其是杂草识别接近随机水平。

Conclusion: AgroBench为VLMs的未来发展提供了改进方向，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Precise automated understanding of agricultural tasks such as disease
identification is essential for sustainable crop production. Recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of
agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy,
text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI
Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural
topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to
real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is
annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range
of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to
thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal
that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks.
Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random.
With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the
types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM
development. Our dataset and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种低成本、模块化的系统，实现绿扁豆的实时多类别分类和分选，以提升谷物分选的效率和准确性。

Method: 采用两阶段YOLOv8模型，分别进行检测和分类，结合气动喷射机制和Arduino控制系统实现实时操作。

Result: 系统在59 mm/s的传送带速度下运行，分离准确率达87.2%，但处理速率较低（8克/分钟）。

Conclusion: 原型展示了机器视觉在谷物分选中的潜力，为未来改进提供了模块化基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a dynamic
grain classification system for green lentils (Lens Culinaris), which leverages
computer vision and pneumatic ejection. The system integrates a YOLOv8-based
detection model that identifies and locates grains on a conveyor belt, together
with a second YOLOv8-based classification model that categorises grains into
six classes: Good, Yellow, Broken, Peeled, Dotted, and Reject. This two-stage
YOLOv8 pipeline enables accurate, real-time, multi-class categorisation of
lentils, implemented on a low-cost, modular hardware platform. The pneumatic
ejection mechanism separates defective grains, while an Arduino-based control
system coordinates real-time interaction between the vision system and
mechanical components. The system operates effectively at a conveyor speed of
59 mm/s, achieving a grain separation accuracy of 87.2%. Despite a limited
processing rate of 8 grams per minute, the prototype demonstrates the potential
of machine vision for grain sorting and provides a modular foundation for
future enhancements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次研究草图质量评估，提出了一种无需人工标注的通用方法GACL，通过特征幅值作为质量度量，并验证了其与人类感知的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决草图质量评估问题，避免依赖人工标注。

Method: 提出Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL)，将特征幅值与可识别性学习作为双重任务，通过交叉熵分类损失优化。

Result: GACL诱导的度量与人类感知一致，并成功应用于草图质量评估、图像质量评估和噪声标签清理。

Conclusion: GACL是一种通用方法，适用于多种视觉表示和垂直问题。

Abstract: As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do them
justice (Fig.~\ref{fig:intro}). This paper recognises this very problem and
studies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these
badly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$
norm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose
Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes
feature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without
the need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature
magnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be
simultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with
theoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the
better the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both
network architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through
a large scale human study of 160,000 \doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the
agreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We
further demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first
time enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL
not only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also
extends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment
(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as
general-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in
vertical problems such as noisy label cleansing. Code will be made publicly
available at github.com/yanglan0225/SketchX-Quantifying-Sketch-Quality.

TL;DR: 提出FED-PsyAU框架，结合心理学先验和统计模式，通过分层学习提升微表情识别性能，同时利用联邦学习保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临样本小、特征细微及隐私问题，需高效建模和跨场景隐私保护。

Method: 结合心理学研究（上下脸动作单元协调）和统计模式，开发DPK-GAT网络进行分层特征学习，并采用联邦学习框架。

Result: 在常用微表情数据库上验证了方法的有效性，提升了识别性能并保护隐私。

Conclusion: FED-PsyAU框架有效解决了微表情识别的样本和隐私问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, low-intensity, often localized facial
expressions. They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to
conceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological
counseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small
sample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.
Additionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving
the task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints
largely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research
framework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and
lower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial
muscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these
psychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical
learning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively
enhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework
advances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing,
preserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client.
Extensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 传统单模态船舶检测方法在复杂场景（如光照变化和浓雾）中效果有限，需探索多模态融合的优势。

Result: 在NSLSR数据集上验证了算法的优越性，生成视觉上令人印象深刻的融合图像并提升检测性能。

Conclusion: LSFDNet通过多模态融合和任务交互，显著提升了复杂场景下的船舶检测效果。

Abstract: Traditional ship detection methods primarily rely on single-modal approaches,
such as visible or infrared images, which limit their application in complex
scenarios involving varying lighting conditions and heavy fog. To address this
issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave
infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion
detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature
interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,
achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive
fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images
and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the
Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive
fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple
modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.
Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object
Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object
semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary
fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,
thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a
Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective
SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this
field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion
detection algorithm on two datasets. The source code and dataset are available

TL;DR: M-Net提出了一种用于MRI肿瘤分割的灵活框架，利用相邻MRI切片的空间相关性，通过Mesh-Cast机制和TPS训练策略提升分割精度和连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI肿瘤分割在3D数据中面临计算复杂性和空间相关性利用不足的问题，现有模型未能充分利用切片间的时序信息。

Method: M-Net引入Mesh-Cast机制整合时序信息，设计TPS训练策略分两阶段学习序列模式和切片特征。

Result: 在BraTS2019和BraTS2023数据集上，M-Net在所有关键指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M-Net通过时序建模技术，提供了一种高效且鲁棒的MRI肿瘤分割解决方案。

Abstract: MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
volumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of
3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides
valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet
this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial
correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as "temporal-like"
data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this
gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for
sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,
which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of
both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the
inherent "temporal-like" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally,
we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential
(TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across
sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach
leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual
information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions,
thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential
segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics,
establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor
segmentation.

Motivation: 现有图像修复方法（如MSE、GAN和扩散模型）难以在修复质量、保真度和速度之间取得平衡，HYPIR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HYPIR通过预训练扩散模型初始化修复模型，再通过对抗训练微调，避免了扩散损失和迭代采样，同时继承了扩散模型的用户控制能力。

Result: HYPIR在数值稳定性、避免模式崩溃和加速收敛方面表现优异，实验证明其优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HYPIR实现了高效高质量的图像修复，同时具备快速收敛和推理速度的优势。

Abstract: Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image
space to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges:
removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level
consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including
MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to
achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We
propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution
pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration
model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with
adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative
sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that
initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions
the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution.
Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode
collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial
training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with
rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture
richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence
and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show
that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient
and high-quality image restoration.

Conclusion: DAMS通过双路径互补和信息融合，实现了从底层特征到高层语义的完整推理链，为视频异常检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing
spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale
temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of
labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging
research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture
called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),
which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient
anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and
complementary information. The main processing path of this framework
integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the
Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained
representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features
through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature
fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy
distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention
mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a
contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic
alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order
semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete
inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level
semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the
information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation
and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental
results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness
of the DAMS framework.

Conclusion: 方法有效恢复色彩映射，适用于多种场景，包括离散调色板和有图例的可视化。

Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization
can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color
legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that
extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by
simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a
decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input
visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then
reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To
guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and
reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure
strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a
self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen
visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color
ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap
representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.
We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset
and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.
Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --
colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to
visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color
palettes.

Abstract: Accurate detection of defects such as hotspots and snail trails in

segmenting thermal infrared images of PV panels, using a dataset of 277 aerial
thermographic images captured by zenmuse XT infrared camera mounted on a DJI

customised Transformwer encoder and streamlined decoder, and fine-tuned on
annotated images with manually labeled defect regions. To evaluate performance,
we benchmark our model against U-Net, DeepLabV3, PSPNet, and Mask2Former using
consistent preprocessing and augmentation. Evaluation metrices includes

The SegFormer-based model outperforms baselines in accuracy and efficiency,

Abstract: We present a derivation for estimating the roll and pitch orientation of a
partially calibrated camera mounted above a planar surface, using minimal scene
information. Specifically, we assume known intrinsic parameters and a fixed
height between the camera and the observed plane. By detecting a single
straight reference line at a known planar distance -- such as the edge between
a floor and a wall -- we estimate the roll and pitch angles via inverse
projection geometry. The method leverages geometric constraints and the camera
model, including lens distortion correction. This approach is suitable for
scenarios where full calibration is impractical and offers a lightweight
alternative for multi-camera systems operating in constrained environments.

Abstract: Image composition has advanced significantly with large-scale pre-trained T2I
diffusion models. Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain
composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic
nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to
failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits
practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image
composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural
stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,
preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward
inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also
uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from
foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention
strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable
stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark
dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the
lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD
metric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and
applications. Code and benchmark at https://github.com/sherlhw/AIComposer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱-强一致性学习方法忽视了框架本身的潜力和限制，如分离的训练数据流和不完整的监督信息利用。

Result: 实验证明该框架在多种半监督医学分割基准中表现优越。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了现有问题，提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Weak-strong consistency learning strategies are widely employed in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation to train models by leveraging
limited labeled data and enforcing weak-to-strong consistency. However,
existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various
perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within
the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical
deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation
bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of
supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak
consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and
prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically,
inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between
labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we
design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent
training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong
pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to
encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both
weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse
effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks
under various semi-supervised settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种隐式反事实框架（ICF）和多粒度隐式文本（MIT）方法，以减少音频-视觉分割（AVS）中的模态差异和偏差，并通过对比学习提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AVS方法主要关注交互效率，而忽视了模态表示差异和不平衡问题，导致在复杂场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出ICF和MIT方法，通过隐式文本建立模态共享空间，并引入语义反事实（SC）和对比学习（CDCL）来减少偏差和对齐表示。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ICF和MIT方法有效解决了AVS中的模态差异问题，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment objects in videos based on
audio cues. Existing AVS methods are primarily designed to enhance interaction
efficiency but pay limited attention to modality representation discrepancies
and imbalances. To overcome this, we propose the implicit counterfactual
framework (ICF) to achieve unbiased cross-modal understanding. Due to the lack
of semantics, heterogeneous representations may lead to erroneous matches,
especially in complex scenes with ambiguous visual content or interference from
multiple audio sources. We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT)
involving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the
modality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance.
Visual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby
marginalizing audio features in the decision-making. To mitigate knowledge
preference, we propose the semantic counterfactual (SC) to learn orthogonal
representations in the latent space, generating diverse counterfactual samples,
thus avoiding biases introduced by complex functional designs and explicit
modifications of text structures or attributes. We further formulate the
collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL), incorporating
factual-counterfactual and inter-modality contrasts to align representations,
promoting cohesion and decoupling. Extensive experiments on three public
datasets validate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 现有方法在运动场景中因动作复杂、运动模糊、遮挡和领域偏移等问题表现不佳，尤其是瞬时性动作（如投篮）的分析能力不足。

Method: 引入KASportsFormer框架，结合骨骼提取器（BoneExt）和肢体融合器（LimbFus）模块，提取并编码运动信息，提升短视频中运动姿态的理解能力。

Result: 在两个代表性运动数据集（SportsPose和WorldPose）上，MPJPE误差分别为58.0mm和34.3mm，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: KASportsFormer通过改进的运动信息表示和集成模块，显著提升了运动场景中的3D姿态估计性能。

Abstract: Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance
in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these
approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall
short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily
life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.
Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish
in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions
is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear
to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation
framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature
representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion
information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser
(LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the
capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our
method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and
WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively.

Conclusion: ATR-UMMIM将成为推动无人机多模态配准、融合和感知研究的基础基准。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as
each modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction.
However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and
sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a
prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no
publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration
in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and
evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To
bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically
tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This
dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely
registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight
altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and
all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination
conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated
annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each
triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition
attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world
deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide
object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object
categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe
ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal
registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios. The datatset

Result: 在图像到代码生成任务中，RRVF显著优于现有开源模型和监督微调基线。

Conclusion: 纯视觉反馈驱动的系统为更鲁棒和通用的推理模型提供了可行路径，无需显式监督。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive
performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into
enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their
performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of
MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated
image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework
termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to
learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on
the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the
rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We
demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for
optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on
the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a
closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual
feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through
multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be
optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments
on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF
substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised
fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely
visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable
reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available

Motivation: 现有遥感视觉语言研究依赖同质数据源，局限于分类或描述任务，无法统一处理多源异构数据。

Method: 提出RingMo-Agent模型，利用大规模RS-VL3M数据集，采用模态自适应表征和任务统一建模方法。

Result: 实验表明，RingMo-Agent在视觉理解和复杂分析任务中表现优异，并具有跨平台和模态的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: RingMo-Agent为多源遥感图像处理提供了统一且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images from multiple modalities and platforms exhibit
diverse details due to differences in sensor characteristics and imaging
perspectives. Existing vision-language research in RS largely relies on
relatively homogeneous data sources. Moreover, they still remain limited to
conventional visual perception tasks such as classification or captioning. As a
result, these methods fail to serve as a unified and standalone framework
capable of effectively handling RS imagery from diverse sources in real-world
applications. To address these issues, we propose RingMo-Agent, a model
designed to handle multi-modal and multi-platform data that performs perception
and reasoning tasks based on user textual instructions. Compared with existing
models, RingMo-Agent 1) is supported by a large-scale vision-language dataset
named RS-VL3M, comprising over 3 million image-text pairs, spanning optical,
SAR, and infrared (IR) modalities collected from both satellite and UAV
platforms, covering perception and challenging reasoning tasks; 2) learns
modality adaptive representations by incorporating separated embedding layers
to construct isolated features for heterogeneous modalities and reduce
cross-modal interference; 3) unifies task modeling by introducing task-specific
tokens and employing a token-based high-dimensional hidden state decoding
mechanism designed for long-horizon spatial tasks. Extensive experiments on
various RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves
effective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but
also exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing
modalities.

Motivation: 森林高度估计对气候变化监测和碳循环评估至关重要，传统SAR方法依赖模型，而FGump通过数据驱动方法提升效率和精度。

Method: FGump采用梯度提升算法，结合多通道SAR数据和LiDAR地面真实值，避免复杂预处理，使用少量手工设计特征。

Conclusion: FGump在森林高度估计中实现了高精度与高效计算的平衡，为相关领域提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate forest height estimation is crucial for climate change monitoring
and carbon cycle assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly in
multi-channel configurations, has provided support for a long time in 3D forest
structure reconstruction through model-based techniques. More recently,
data-driven approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have
enabled new opportunities for forest parameter retrieval. This paper introduces
FGump, a forest height estimation framework by gradient boosting using
multi-channel SAR processing with LiDAR profiles as Ground Truth(GT). Unlike
typical ML and DL approaches that require large datasets and complex
architectures, FGump ensures a strong balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency, using a limited set of hand-designed features and
avoiding heavy preprocessing (e.g., calibration and/or quantization). Evaluated
under both classification and regression paradigms, the proposed framework
demonstrates that the regression formulation enables fine-grained, continuous
estimations and avoids quantization artifacts by resulting in more precise
measurements without rounding. Experimental results confirm that FGump
outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI-based and classical methods, achieving
higher accuracy and significantly lower training and inference times, as
demonstrated in our results.

Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的进步，伪造身份证件变得容易，这对KYC应用构成威胁，需要开发更强大的检测系统。

Method: 创建FantasyID数据集，包含多样化的设计风格、语言和真实人脸，模拟真实KYC场景，并通过打印和拍摄生成真实样本，同时模拟数字伪造攻击。

Result: 现有伪造检测算法（如TruFor、MMFusion等）在FantasyID数据集上表现不佳，假阴性率接近50%。

Conclusion: FantasyID数据集复杂度高，适合作为检测算法的评估基准。

Abstract: Advancements in image generation led to the availability of easy-to-use tools
for malicious actors to create forged images. These tools pose a serious threat
to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust
systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the
development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel
publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics
real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to
previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen
watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages,
and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from
FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting
the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that
could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing
generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms,
such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID
dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to
practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false
positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across
the board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that
FantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for
detection algorithms.

Abstract: Building footprint extraction holds immense significance in remote sensing
image analysis and has great value in urban planning, land use, environmental
protection and disaster assessment. Despite the progress made by conventional

significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play attention
module, Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), which ingeniously captures spatially
remote interactions by employing two spatial range of pooling kernels,
strategically encoding each channel along x and y planes, and separately
performs a series of split operations for each feature group, thus enabling
more efficient semantic feature extraction. By inserting into a 2D CNN to form
an effective SCANet, our SCANet outperforms recent SOTA methods on the public
Wuhan University (WHU) Building Dataset and Massachusetts Building Dataset in
terms of various metrics. Particularly SCANet achieves the best IoU, 91.61% and
75.49% for the two datasets. Our code is available at

Result: 在新归纳设置下，现有方法性能平均下降55%，提出的改进方法在5880次实验中表现最优。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了CLIP少样本分类评估的问题，提供了无学习解决方案，并提出了改进方法和新基准。

Abstract: CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in
the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP
using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been
benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of
evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization
ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP
model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve
this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true
inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a
significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with
multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle
baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that
consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline
methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the
datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with
different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based
few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new
benchmarks, and provide an improved method.

Conclusion: METEOR首次成功实现了高效的多编码器视觉语言模型，为多模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision encoders serve as the cornerstone of multimodal understanding.
Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in
generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion
methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior
performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision
encoders. To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely
Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant
visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for
multi-encoder MLLMs. For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens
within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy.
Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from
different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative
pruning. Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM
decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts
with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. To our
best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient
multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. Compared with EAGLE, a typical multi-encoder MLLMs, METEOR
reduces 76% visual tokens with only 0.3% performance drop in average. The code

Abstract: We propose $S^3$LAM, a novel RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D surfel
splatting to achieve highly accurate geometric representations for simultaneous
tracking and mapping. Unlike existing 3DGS-based SLAM approaches that rely on
3D Gaussian ellipsoids, we utilize 2D Gaussian surfels as primitives for more
efficient scene representation. By focusing on the surfaces of objects in the
scene, this design enables $S^3$LAM to reconstruct high-quality geometry,
benefiting both mapping and tracking. To address inherent SLAM challenges
including real-time optimization under limited viewpoints, we introduce a novel
adaptive surface rendering strategy that improves mapping accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency. We further derive camera pose Jacobians
directly from 2D surfel splatting formulation, highlighting the importance of
our geometrically accurate representation that improves tracking convergence.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate that
$S^3$LAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made publicly

Abstract: We present a novel framework for compositional video synthesis that leverages
temporally consistent object-centric representations, extending our previous
work, SlotAdapt, from images to video. While existing object-centric approaches
either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences
holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach
explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric
slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables
high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and
offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion,
deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across
frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks
in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous
object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance
closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this
capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing
interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for
advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.

Method: 提出UnionCut（基于min-cut和集成方法的前景先验）和UnionSeg（高效蒸馏模型），帮助UOD算法准确识别前景并动态停止发现。

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D
images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised
representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the
absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)
determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing
how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous
solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is
foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the
existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed
number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of
objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and
well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that
detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to
identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the
foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a
distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more
efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with
UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase
in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and
self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks. The code is

Result: 实验表明DriveAgent-R1性能优于现有模型，决策基于主动感知的视觉证据。

Conclusion: DriveAgent-R1为更安全、智能的自动驾驶系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their
potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception,
limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to
tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making.
DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that
adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based
reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to
proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency
and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive
reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models,
such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm
that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual
evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.

Abstract: Endoscopic depth estimation is a critical technology for improving the safety
and precision of minimally invasive surgery. It has attracted considerable
attention from researchers in medical imaging, computer vision, and robotics.
Over the past decade, a large number of methods have been developed. Despite
the existence of several related surveys, a comprehensive overview focusing on
recent deep learning-based techniques is still limited. This paper endeavors to
bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature.
Specifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key
perspectives: data, methods, and applications, covering a range of methods
including both monocular and stereo approaches. We describe common performance
evaluation metrics and summarize publicly available datasets. Furthermore, this
review analyzes the specific challenges of endoscopic scenes and categorizes
representative techniques based on their supervision strategies and network
architectures. The application of endoscopic depth estimation in the important
area of robot-assisted surgery is also reviewed. Finally, we outline potential
directions for future research, such as domain adaptation, real-time
implementation, and enhanced model generalization, thereby providing a valuable
starting point for researchers to engage with and advance the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非手动面部特征在手语交流中很重要，但在自动手语识别中研究不足，现有方法多依赖手工特征提取。

Method: 使用CNN和Transformer模型，系统评估不同面部区域（眼、嘴、全脸）对识别的影响。

Result: 嘴部是最重要的非手动面部特征，显著提升识别准确性。

Conclusion: 自动手语识别需纳入面部特征，尤其是嘴部。

Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language
communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition
(ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating
facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on
hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual
features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we
systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes,
mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model
and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with
randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative
saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important
non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings
highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在Img2LaTeX任务中表现不佳，尤其在细粒度视觉元素处理上存在不足。

Method: 提出$A^2R^2$框架，结合注意力定位和迭代优化，使VLMs能够自我修正并逐步提升预测质量。

Result: 实验表明$A^2R^2$在六个评估指标上显著优于基线方法，且推理轮次增加带来性能提升。

Conclusion: $A^2R^2$通过视觉推理和注意力优化有效解决了Img2LaTeX任务中的挑战，其核心组件协同作用显著。

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting
mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent
years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization
capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the
Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations.
Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading
to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose
$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with
Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention
localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework,
enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction
quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset,
Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging
examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this
task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$
significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning
both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline
methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable
performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling
scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical
effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core
components during inference.

Result: 在PSNR上优于现有方法3 dB，且能提升深度估计和光流任务性能20%。

Conclusion: 该方法为恶劣天气下的视觉系统提供了更可靠的解决方案，推动了全天候应用的发展。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant
challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional
image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they
rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high
frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera
parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,
making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network
generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing
by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with
submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the
presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions
appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal
representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses
on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded
and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our
method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that
overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,
resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for
image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision
algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth
estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over
other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing
the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,
paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对低空无人机场景的细粒度参考图像分割（RIS）基准数据集RIS-LAD，并设计了语义感知自适应推理网络（SAARN）来解决该场景中的独特挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空无人机（LAD）场景中的参考图像分割（RIS）研究不足，现有方法难以处理其多视角、高密度等特性。

Method: 提出了RIS-LAD数据集和SAARN模型，后者通过类别主导的语言增强（CDLE）和自适应推理融合模块（ARFM）动态处理语义信息。

Result: 实验表明RIS-LAD对现有RIS算法构成挑战，SAARN能有效解决这些问题。

Conclusion: RIS-LAD填补了LAD场景的空白，SAARN为复杂场景下的RIS提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects
based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in
vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing
applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.
Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and
static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD
views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we
present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD
scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask
triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,
cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in
previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object
drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the
Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly
injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic
information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the
Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with
object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion
Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve
reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD
presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also
demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these
challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合生成式AI（T2I）的方法T2I-QBE，用于解决传统基于示例查询（QBE）的文档图像检索（DIR）中样本不足的问题，并在历史文档数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QBE方法需要现成的查询样本，而ABDIR虽灵活但依赖视觉属性描述。本文旨在通过生成式AI（T2I）结合两者的优势，解决样本不足问题。

Method: 提出T2I-QBE方法，利用Leonardo.Ai生成基于ABDIR属性描述的查询图像，再通过传统QBE进行检索。

Result: 在HisIR19历史文档数据集上的实验验证了T2I-QBE的可行性。

Conclusion: T2I-QBE是DIR领域首次尝试利用T2I生成技术，为历史文档检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an
alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image
retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require
sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer
users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual
features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of
visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI
to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a
use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize
that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document
images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,
which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough
description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style
attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional
QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the
document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.
Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our
hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document
image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at
utilizing T2I generation for DIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型缺乏对短视频的深入理解能力，而短视频在移动互联网中占据主导地位，需要更高效的视频搜索和推荐技术。

Method: 模型通过预训练、指令微调、冷启动、强化学习后训练和最终微调的综合训练方案，利用高质量数据实现多任务视频理解。

Conclusion: ARC-Hunyuan-Video在短视频理解方面具有强大性能，支持零样本或少样本微调，适用于多样化下游应用。

Abstract: Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on
platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.
However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,
detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the
cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging
video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due
to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and
audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint
delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal
information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce
ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual
signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The
model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and
summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,
and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation
pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive
regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement
learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative
evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative
comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video
comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for
diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our
model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and
satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress
tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on
H20 GPU.

Abstract: Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation aims at generating realistic videos of
talking faces, focusing on accurate audio-lip synchronization without
deteriorating any identity-related visual details. Recent state-of-the-art
methods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face
is masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned
with the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from
the lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity
reference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common
masking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,
significantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and
identity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image
degrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively
impacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the
audio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation
approach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking
the lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a
two-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,
we provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside
the audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs
neither masked input images nor identity reference images. We conduct
experiments on the benchmark LRS2 and HDTF datasets and perform various
ablation studies to validate our contributions.

Conclusion: GTAD通过全局时间信息聚合，显著提升了动态环境感知的连贯性和全面性，为3D场景理解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Accurately perceiving dynamic environments is a fundamental task for
autonomous driving and robotic systems. Existing methods inadequately utilize
temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between
adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information
effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively
aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve
occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information
from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal
aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal
information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene
understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to
aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal
features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective
perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and
global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides
a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in
traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning
methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application.
However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one
geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in
factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle
types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle)
leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a
novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images
and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our
key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge
transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to
mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments.
Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent
performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain
data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation
methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than
50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial
datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

Result: 在多个大规模多视图基准测试中，LargeMvC-Net在效果和可扩展性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LargeMvC-Net通过模块化设计和优化步骤展开，显著提升了锚点多视图聚类的性能。

Abstract: Deep anchor-based multi-view clustering methods enhance the scalability of
neural networks by utilizing representative anchors to reduce the computational
complexity of large-scale clustering. Despite their scalability advantages,
existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or
task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as
auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core
structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization
principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem
of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative
solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The
proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three
modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to
representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation.
Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization
procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and
optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss
aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent
clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several
large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and
scalability.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了CNN模型对不同对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in computer vision but are
susceptible to adversarial attacks, crafted perturbations designed to mislead
predictions. Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between
model accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we
present a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive
learning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple
clones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool
of perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,
these adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the
learning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an
adaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each
model by assigning weights as per their prediction precision. Distilling
knowledge from adversarially pre-trained teacher models not only enhances the
learning capabilities of the student model but also empowers it with the
capacity to withstand different adversarial attacks, despite having no exposure
to adversarial data. To verify our claims, we extensively evaluated our
proposed method on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets across diverse
experimental settings. The obtained results exhibit the efficacy of our
multi-teacher adversarial distillation and adaptive learning strategy,
enhancing CNNs' adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用自然语言描述作为监督信号的面部情绪识别方法，通过构建大规模数据集EmoCap100K和框架EmoCapCLIP，解决了传统固定标签方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统面部情绪识别系统使用固定标签或维度值，限制了情绪的丰富性和泛化能力。自然语言描述提供了更灵活的表达方式，但缺乏大规模数据集和有效框架。

Method: 提出EmoCap100K数据集（10万样本）和EmoCapCLIP框架，采用全局-局部对比学习及跨模态引导正样本挖掘模块。

Result: 在20多个基准测试中表现优异，验证了从大规模语义丰富描述中学习情绪表征的潜力。

Conclusion: 利用自然语言描述作为监督信号是面部情绪识别的有效方法，EmoCapCLIP框架展现了其优越性。

Abstract: Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to
predict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values.
This constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability,
as it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified
labels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,
expressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much
broader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural
language captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation
learning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:
1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and
2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich
supervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion
caption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured
semantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and
fine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further
propose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive
learning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.
This design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption
information while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related
expressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of
learning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich
captions. The code and data will be available at

TL;DR: 本文提出Rehab-Pile数据集和通用基准框架，用于评估康复运动质量分析的深度学习方法，旨在推动透明和可重复的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 康复运动评估缺乏标准化基准和一致方法，限制了研究进展和可比性。

Method: 整合现有数据集为Rehab-Pile，提出基准框架，并评估多种深度学习架构。

Result: 发布了数据集和源代码，支持透明性和可重复性。

Conclusion: 为自动化康复评估研究奠定基础，促进可靠、可访问和个性化康复解决方案的发展。

Abstract: Automated assessment of human motion plays a vital role in rehabilitation,
enabling objective evaluation of patient performance and progress. Unlike
general human activity recognition, rehabilitation motion assessment focuses on
analyzing the quality of movement within the same action class, requiring the
detection of subtle deviations from ideal motion. Recent advances in deep
learning and video-based skeleton extraction have opened new possibilities for
accessible, scalable motion assessment using affordable devices such as
smartphones or webcams. However, the field lacks standardized benchmarks,
consistent evaluation protocols, and reproducible methodologies, limiting
progress and comparability across studies. In this work, we address these gaps
by (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive
called Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for
evaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive
benchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression
tasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to
support transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid
foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and
foster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation
solutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all
publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M，一个公开的大规模图像编辑数据集，通过改进现有数据集并验证其效果，推动了开源研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于GPT-4o等大型多模态模型的封闭性，开源研究受限，因此需要公开的高质量数据集来填补这一空白。

Method: 利用GPT-4o统一并优化三个流行图像编辑数据集，通过重新生成图像和改写提示来提升质量。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，微调后的模型表现优异，显著超越现有开源方法，接近专有模型水平。

Conclusion: GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M的发布有望推动指令引导图像编辑的开源研究发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models like GPT-4o have set a new
standard for high-fidelity, instruction-guided image editing. However, the
proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a
significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce
GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus
containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source
image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging
the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular
image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our
methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality
and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve
semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune
advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are
exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive
performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on
GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger
instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.
These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and
substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full
release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in
instruction-guided image editing.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的视角，将4D空间智能的重建方法分为五个渐进层次，并总结了各层次的关键挑战和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D空间智能重建在计算机视觉中具有重要意义，但现有研究缺乏对层次结构的全面分析。

Method: 将现有方法分为五个层次：低层3D属性重建、3D场景组件重建、4D动态场景重建、交互建模及物理约束整合。

Result: 提供了一个层次化的分类框架，并总结了各层次的关键挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注更高层次的4D空间智能，如交互建模和物理约束整合。

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been
a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world
applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the
focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,
which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid
advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has
evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,
existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical
structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new
perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D
spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes
(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene
components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction
of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene
components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.
We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and
highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D
spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date
project page: https://github.com/yukangcao/Awesome-4D-Spatial-Intelligence.

*Maria Emilia Mazzolenis,Ruirui Zhang*

TL;DR: WARPP是一个无需训练、模块化的框架，通过多智能体协同和运行时个性化提升LLM在任务导向对话中的工作流遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在任务导向对话系统中应用广泛，但在处理涉及外部工具调用和用户特定信息的复杂条件工作流时表现不佳。

Method: WARPP结合多智能体协同和运行时个性化，动态修剪条件分支以减少推理开销和工具选择范围。

Result: 在银行、航班和医疗领域的五种用户意图测试中，WARPP在参数保真度、工具准确性和平均令牌使用量上优于非个性化方法和ReAct基线。

Conclusion: WARPP通过动态个性化显著提升了复杂意图下的性能，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in task-oriented
dialogue (TOD) systems but often struggle with long, conditional workflows that
involve external tool calls and depend on user-specific information. We present
Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization, or WARPP, a
training-free, modular framework that combines multi-agent orchestration with
runtime personalization to improve workflow adherence in LLM-based systems. By
dynamically pruning conditional branches based on user attributes, the
framework reduces reasoning overhead and narrows tool selection at runtime.
WARPP deploys a parallelized architecture where a dedicated Personalizer agent
operates alongside modular, domain-specific agents to dynamically tailor
execution paths in real time. The framework is evaluated across five
representative user intents of varying complexity within three domains:
banking, flights, and healthcare. Our evaluation leverages synthetic datasets
and LLM-powered simulated users to test scenarios with conditional
dependencies. Our results demonstrate that WARPP outperforms both the
non-personalized method and the ReAct baseline, achieving increasingly larger
gains in parameter fidelity and tool accuracy as intent complexity grows, while
also reducing average token usage, without any additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统博弈论假设理性、完全信息和共同知识，但现实中的多智能体系统常存在不确定性和认知差异。超博弈理论通过建模主观感知弥补了这一不足。

Method: 通过系统回顾44项研究，引入超博弈理论及其扩展（分层超博弈和HNF），提出智能体兼容性标准和分类框架。

Result: 研究发现分层和图模型在欺骗推理中占主导，实际应用中理论框架常被简化，同时存在HNF模型采用不足、缺乏形式化语言等问题。

Conclusion: 本文为超博弈理论在动态多智能体环境中的应用提供了新路线图，强调了增强战略建模的现实性和有效性。

Abstract: Classical game-theoretic models typically assume rational agents, complete
information, and common knowledge of payoffs - assumptions that are often
violated in real-world MAS characterized by uncertainty, misaligned
perceptions, and nested beliefs. To overcome these limitations, researchers
have proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,
subjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory
extends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective
perceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which
agents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available
actions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of
hypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted
to dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from
cybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general
game-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory
and its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop
agent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to
assess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals
prevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based
models in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical
frameworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including
the limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame
languages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and
agent-agent misalignment. By synthesizing trends, challenges, and open research
directions, this review provides a new roadmap for applying hypergame theory to
enhance the realism and effectiveness of strategic modeling in dynamic
multi-agent environments.

TL;DR: DeltaLLM是一种无需训练的动态注意力剪枝框架，通过利用注意力模式的时间稀疏性，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现高效LLM推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在边缘设备上的计算复杂度随序列长度呈二次增长，现有动态注意力剪枝方法不适合边缘场景，DeltaLLM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DeltaLLM采用基于精度和内存的增量矩阵构建策略，结合局部上下文窗口内的完整注意力和窗口外的增量近似，提高效率。

Result: 在BitNet和Llama模型上，DeltaLLM在预填充和解码阶段分别实现高达60%和57%的注意力稀疏性，同时保持或提升任务精度。

Conclusion: DeltaLLM为边缘设备上的高效LLM部署提供了无需微调的解决方案，且与现有推理流程无缝集成。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices remains challenging
due to their quadratically increasing computations with the sequence length.
Existing studies for dynamic attention pruning are designed for hardware with
massively parallel computation capabilities, such as GPUs or TPUs, and aim at
long context lengths (e.g., 64K), making them unsuitable for edge scenarios. We
present DeltaLLM, a training-free framework that exploits temporal sparsity in
attention patterns to enable efficient LLM inference across both the prefilling
and decoding stages, on resource-constrained edge devices. DeltaLLM introduces
an accuracy- and memory-aware delta matrix construction strategy that
introduces temporal sparsity, and a context-aware hybrid attention mechanism
that combines full attention in a local context window with delta approximation
outside it to increase accuracy. We evaluate our framework on the
edge-device-friendly BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T model and Llama3.2-1B-Instruct model
across diverse language tasks. The results show that on BitNet, our framework
increases the attention sparsity from 0% to 60% during the prefilling stage
with slight accuracy improvement on the WG task, and 0% to 57% across both the
prefilling and decoding stages, with even higher F1 score from 29.63 to 30.97
on SQuAD-v2 task. On the Llama model, it can also achieve up to 60% sparsity
during the prefilling stage and around 57% across both stages with negligible
accuracy drop. These results demonstrate that DeltaLLM offers a promising
solution for efficient edge deployment, requiring no fine-tuning and seamlessly
integrating with existing inference pipelines.

aligning with nuanced human intent. We discuss state-of-the-art techniques,
including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI,
brain-inspired methods, and alignment uncertainty quantification (AUQ),
highlighting their approaches to balancing quality and efficiency. We review
existing evaluation frameworks and benchmarking datasets, emphasizing
limitations such as reward misspecification, distributional robustness, and
scalable oversight. We summarize strategies adopted by leading AI labs to
illustrate the current state of practice. We conclude by outlining open

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在提升预测可靠性方面的局限性，揭示其学习机制与准确性之间的冲突。

Method: 分析LLM的缩放规律及其对预测不确定性的影响，探讨错误累积和信息灾难的机制。

Result: LLM的可靠性提升受限于其学习机制，错误累积和信息灾难是其潜在问题。

Conclusion: 为避免LLM的退化路径，需更重视对问题结构特性的理解和洞察。

Abstract: We show that the scaling laws which determine the performance of large
language models (LLMs) severely limit their ability to improve the uncertainty
of their predictions. As a result, raising their reliability to meet the
standards of scientific inquiry is intractable by any reasonable measure. We
argue that the very mechanism which fuels much of the learning power of LLMs,
namely the ability to generate non-Gaussian output distributions from Gaussian
input ones, might well be at the roots of their propensity to produce error
pileup, ensuing information catastrophes and degenerative AI behaviour. This
tension between learning and accuracy is a likely candidate mechanism
underlying the observed low values of the scaling components. It is
substantially compounded by the deluge of spurious correlations pointed out by
Calude and Longo which rapidly increase in any data set merely as a function of
its size, regardless of its nature. The fact that a degenerative AI pathway is
a very probable feature of the LLM landscape does not mean that it must
inevitably arise in all future AI research. Its avoidance, which we also
discuss in this paper, necessitates putting a much higher premium on insight
and understanding of the structural characteristics of the problems being
investigated.

TL;DR: 论文研究了内在动机（IM）方法在强化学习（RL）中解决奖励稀疏性问题时引发的奖励黑客行为，并通过实验评估了三种IM技术对MiniGrid环境中RL代理行为的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏对RL代理具有挑战性，因为奖励稀疏，仅在一系列复杂动作后才能获得。IM方法通过引入探索奖励解决这一问题，但可能导致奖励黑客行为，即代理为优化新奖励而牺牲游戏表现。

Method: 研究在MiniGrid环境中比较了三种IM技术与广义奖励匹配（GRM）方法，评估其对RL代理行为的影响。

Result: IM显著改变了代理的行为，增加了初始奖励，但也改变了代理的游戏方式；GRM在某些情况下缓解了奖励黑客问题。

Conclusion: IM确实会影响RL代理的行为，而GRM可以作为缓解奖励黑客问题的潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Games are challenging for Reinforcement Learning~(RL) agents due to their
reward-sparsity, as rewards are only obtainable after long sequences of
deliberate actions. Intrinsic Motivation~(IM) methods -- which introduce
exploration rewards -- are an effective solution to reward-sparsity. However,
IM also causes an issue known as `reward hacking' where the agent optimizes for
the new reward at the expense of properly playing the game. The larger problem
is that reward hacking itself is largely unknown; there is no answer to
whether, and to what extent, IM rewards change the behavior of RL agents. This
study takes a first step by empirically evaluating the impact on behavior of
three IM techniques on the MiniGrid game-like environment. We compare these IM
models with Generalized Reward Matching~(GRM), a method that can be used with
any intrinsic reward function to guarantee optimality. Our results suggest that
IM causes noticeable change by increasing the initial rewards, but also
altering the way the agent plays; and that GRM mitigated reward hacking in some
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用知识图谱缺乏特定患者上下文信息，而电子健康记录提供了丰富的个人数据，两者结合可提高精准医疗的准确性。

Method: 采用实体链接技术连接通用KGs和EHRs数据，利用超图模型和超图变换器学习上下文表示。

Result: 实验表明，HypKG在医疗预测任务中显著优于基线方法，并能调整KGs中实体和关系的表示。

Conclusion: HypKG通过整合外部上下文，提升了知识图谱的实用性和质量，为精准医疗提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are important products of the semantic web, which are
widely used in various application domains. Healthcare is one of such domains
where KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge
accuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing
general factual information often lack the ability to account for important
contexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are
crucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)
provide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which
provide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a
framework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate
contextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.
Using advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from
general KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph
model to "contextualize" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,
we employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to
jointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,
fully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In
experiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG
demonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across
multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, by integrating external contexts,
HypKG can learn to adjust the representations of entities and relations in KG,
potentially improving the quality and real-world utility of knowledge.

Conclusion: 本体结构的知识图谱结合马尔可夫链模型能有效预测未来事件，同时提出的新概率观点更符合现实动态。

Abstract: We argue that ontology-structured knowledge graphs can play a crucial role in
generating predictions about future events. By leveraging the semantic
framework provided by Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies
(CCO), we demonstrate how data such as the movements of a fishing vessel can be
organized in and retrieved from a knowledge graph. These query results are then
used to create Markov chain models, allowing us to predict future states based
on the vessel's history. To fully support this process, we introduce the term
`spatiotemporal instant' to complete the necessary structural semantics.
Additionally, we critique the prevailing ontological model of probability,
which conflates probability with likelihood and relies on the problematic
concept of modal measurements: measurements of future entities. We propose an
alternative view, where probabilities are treated as being about process
profiles, which better captures the dynamics of real world phenomena. Finally,
we demonstrate how our Markov chain based probability calculations can be
seamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph, enabling further analysis
and decision-making. Keywords: predictive analytics, ontology, Markov chains,
probability, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), knowledge graphs, SPARQL.

TL;DR: ASPBench是一个全面的ASP基准测试，揭示了当前大型语言模型在ASP求解中的局限性，尤其是在核心任务答案集计算上的表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对大型语言模型在ASP中能力的评估过于简化，缺乏支持否定、析取或多答案集的测试，且缺少专门设计的ASP任务基准。

Method: 引入ASPBench，包含三个ASP特定任务：ASP蕴含、答案集验证和答案集计算，并对14个先进LLM进行评估。

Result: LLM在前两个简单任务上表现较好，但在核心任务答案集计算上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在ASP求解中存在局限性，需要更有效地整合符号推理能力。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful paradigm for non-monotonic
reasoning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising
capabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations
of LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ
overly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or
multiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce
tasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks:
ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our
extensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非平稳市场中供应链优化的多目标问题，同时考虑经济、环境和社会因素。

Method: 采用多目标强化学习（RL）方法，与改进的单目标RL算法和多目标进化算法（MOEA）进行对比，通过可定制模拟器进行实验。

Result: 主要方法在最优性、多样性和密度之间实现了最平衡的权衡，复杂场景下比MOEA方法高出75%的超体积，解决方案密度是改进单目标RL的11倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在稳定生产和库存水平的同时最小化需求损失，表现出更好的鲁棒性和平衡性。

Abstract: This study develops a generalised multi-objective, multi-echelon supply chain
optimisation model with non-stationary markets based on a Markov decision
process, incorporating economic, environmental, and social considerations. The
model is evaluated using a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) method,
benchmarked against an originally single-objective RL algorithm modified with
weighted sum using predefined weights, and a multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm (MOEA)-based approach. We conduct experiments on varying network
complexities, mimicking typical real-world challenges using a customisable
simulator. The model determines production and delivery quantities across
supply chain routes to achieve near-optimal trade-offs between competing
objectives, approximating Pareto front sets. The results demonstrate that the
primary approach provides the most balanced trade-off between optimality,
diversity, and density, further enhanced with a shared experience buffer that
allows knowledge transfer among policies. In complex settings, it achieves up
to 75\% higher hypervolume than the MOEA-based method and generates solutions
that are approximately eleven times denser, signifying better robustness, than
those produced by the modified single-objective RL method. Moreover, it ensures
stable production and inventory levels while minimising demand loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法因缺乏理论支持，难以生成因果不变的提示，导致特征提取不稳健。

Method: DiCap利用扩散过程从因果模型的边际和条件分布中采样梯度，生成满足最小充分性准则的反事实，并结合对比学习框架优化提示。

Result: 实验表明，DiCap在图像分类、图文检索和视觉问答等任务中表现优异，尤其在未见类别上优势显著。

Conclusion: DiCap通过理论驱动的反事实提示生成，解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning has garnered attention for its efficiency over traditional
model training and fine-tuning. However, existing methods, constrained by
inadequate theoretical foundations, encounter difficulties in achieving
causally invariant prompts, ultimately falling short of capturing robust
features that generalize effectively across categories. To address these
challenges, we introduce the $\textit{\textbf{DiCap}}$ model, a theoretically
grounded $\textbf{Di}$ffusion-based $\textbf{C}$ounterf$\textbf{a}$ctual
$\textbf{p}$rompt learning framework, which leverages a diffusion process to
iteratively sample gradients from the marginal and conditional distributions of
the causal model, guiding the generation of counterfactuals that satisfy the
minimal sufficiency criterion. Grounded in rigorous theoretical derivations,
this approach guarantees the identifiability of counterfactual outcomes while
imposing strict bounds on estimation errors. We further employ a contrastive
learning framework that leverages the generated counterfactuals, thereby
enabling the refined extraction of prompts that are precisely aligned with the
causal features of the data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
our method performs excellently across tasks such as image classification,
image-text retrieval, and visual question answering, with particularly strong
advantages in unseen categories.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了以人为中心的人工智能（AI）本质上是技术与人类认知的关系，分析了AI对人类认知劳动的替代、增强或取代，并指出模糊认知会限制AI系统中真正以人为中心的设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI与人类认知的关系，揭示AI设计中以人为中心的重要性，避免认知模糊带来的负面影响。

Method: 通过对比技术（如算盘、闹钟、相机）与人类认知劳动（如心算、人工叫醒、视觉），提出新的定义和分析框架。

Result: AI对人类认知劳动的影响可分为有害的替代、有益的增强或中性的取代；模糊认知会阻碍AI系统真正以人为中心的设计。

Conclusion: 必须正视AI中的人类认知角色，避免认知模糊，才能真正实现以人为中心的AI设计。

Abstract: While it seems sensible that human-centred artificial intelligence (AI) means
centring "human behaviour and experience," it cannot be any other way. AI, I
argue, is usefully seen as a relationship between technology and humans where
it appears that artifacts can perform, to a greater or lesser extent, human
cognitive labour. This is evinced using examples that juxtapose technology with
cognition, inter alia: abacus versus mental arithmetic; alarm clock versus
knocker-upper; camera versus vision; and sweatshop versus tailor. Using novel
definitions and analyses, sociotechnical relationships can be analysed into
varying types of: displacement (harmful), enhancement (beneficial), and/or
replacement (neutral) of human cognitive labour. Ultimately, all AI implicates
human cognition; no matter what. Obfuscation of cognition in the AI context --
from clocks to artificial neural networks -- results in distortion, in slowing
critical engagement, perverting cognitive science, and indeed in limiting our
ability to truly centre humans and humanity in the engineering of AI systems.
To even begin to de-fetishise AI, we must look the human-in-the-loop in the
eyes.

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）自动从MRI/CT报告中提取胰腺囊性病变（PCL）特征并分配风险类别，性能接近GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取PCL特征耗时费力，限制了大规模研究的需求。

Method: 使用GPT-4o生成的链式思维（CoT）数据微调开源LLM（LLaMA和DeepSeek），并基于指南映射风险类别。

Result: 微调后LLM的特征提取准确率显著提升（LLaMA: 97%；DeepSeek: 98%），风险分类F1分数接近GPT-4o（0.97），与放射科医生的一致性高。

Conclusion: 微调的开源LLM结合CoT监督，能高效、准确地支持大规模PCL研究，性能媲美GPT-4o。

Abstract: Background: Manual extraction of pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from
radiology reports is labor-intensive, limiting large-scale studies needed to
advance PCL research. Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models
(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign
risk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a
training dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134
patients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct
features. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated
CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline
based on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out
human-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently
reviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact
match accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and
radiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning
improved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%
to 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved
(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no
statistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was
high (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference
with the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT
(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels
on par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT
supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for
large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

Motivation: 6G网络中新兴应用对灵活、低延迟和可靠的资源分配提出了严格要求，传统统计建模方法在动态环境中表现不佳，且实时信道状态信息（CSI）获取开销大。

Method: 利用DTC通过环境感知预测CSI，结合轻量级博弈论算法进行在线资源分配。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法比基于导频的理想CSI方案吞吐量提升高达11.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来6G网络提供了可扩展、低开销且环境感知的通信解决方案。

Abstract: Emerging applications such as holographic communication, autonomous driving,
and the industrial Internet of Things impose stringent requirements on
flexible, low-latency, and reliable resource allocation in 6G networks.
Conventional methods, which rely on statistical modeling, have proven effective
in general contexts but may fail to achieve optimal performance in specific and
dynamic environments. Furthermore, acquiring real-time channel state
information (CSI) typically requires excessive pilot overhead. To address these
challenges, a digital twin channel (DTC)-enabled online optimization framework
is proposed, in which DTC is employed to predict CSI based on environmental
sensing. The predicted CSI is then utilized by lightweight game-theoretic
algorithms to perform online resource allocation in a timely and efficient
manner. Simulation results based on a digital replica of a realistic industrial
workshop demonstrate that the proposed method achieves throughput improvements
of up to 11.5\% compared with pilot-based ideal CSI schemes, validating its
effectiveness for scalable, low-overhead, and environment-aware communication
in future 6G networks.

Result: 设想通过结构化对话共享用户偏好，使AI更透明且可解释。

Conclusion: 目标是打造透明、可信的AI系统，不仅提供答案，还能展示推理过程。

Abstract: This perspective paper explores the future potential of "conversational
intelligence" by examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) could be combined
with GRAPHYP's network system to better understand human conversations and
preferences. Using recent research and case studies, we propose a conceptual
framework that could make AI rea-soning transparent and traceable, allowing
humans to see and understand how AI reaches its conclusions. We present the
conceptual perspective of "Matching Game Preferences through Dialogical Large
Language Models (D-LLMs)," a proposed system that would allow multiple users to
share their different preferences through structured conversations. This
approach envisions personalizing LLMs by embedding individual user preferences
directly into how the model makes decisions. The proposed D-LLM framework would
require three main components: (1) reasoning processes that could analyze
different search experiences and guide performance, (2) classification systems
that would identify user preference patterns, and (3) dialogue approaches that
could help humans resolve conflicting information. This perspective framework
aims to create an interpretable AI system where users could examine,
understand, and combine the different human preferences that influence AI
responses, detected through GRAPHYP's search experience networks. The goal of
this perspective is to envision AI systems that would not only provide answers
but also show users how those answers were reached, making artificial
intelligence more transparent and trustworthy for human decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中稳定室友问题不一定有解，需要找到“足够好”的匹配方案。

Method: 结合代理的习惯偏好和朋友网络，生成个性化解决方案。

Result: 通过示例和实证评估验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够为稳定室友问题提供实用的个性化解决方案。

Abstract: The Stable Roommates problems are characterized by the preferences of agents
over other agents as roommates. A solution is a partition of the agents into
pairs that are acceptable to each other (i.e., they are in the preference lists
of each other), and the matching is stable (i.e., there do not exist any two
agents who prefer each other to their roommates, and thus block the matching).
Motivated by real-world applications, and considering that stable roommates
problems do not always have solutions, we continue our studies to compute
"good-enough" matchings. In addition to the agents' habits and habitual
preferences, we consider their networks of preferred friends, and introduce a
method to generate personalized solutions to stable roommates problems. We
illustrate the usefulness of our method with examples and empirical
evaluations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PITA框架通过直接整合偏好反馈到LLM的token生成中，消除了对预训练奖励模型的依赖，降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练的奖励模型，可能导致不稳定，PITA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PITA通过学习一个小型偏好引导策略，在推理时修改token概率，无需LLM微调。

Result: 在数学推理和情感分类等任务中，PITA有效对齐了LLM输出与用户偏好。

Conclusion: PITA提供了一种高效、无需奖励模型的LLM对齐方法。

Abstract: Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate
outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent
post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify
token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward
function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A
critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward
model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially
unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that
integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation,
eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based
guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM
fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward
model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference
distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the
preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks,
including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating
its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

<details>

Motivation: 当前神经网络在多智能体强化学习中缺乏透明度和互操作性，其隐含的合作机制因黑盒特性难以理解。

Method: 提出CMQ方法，通过学习可解释的合作概念（表示为监督向量），利用全局状态嵌入条件化个体动作值，增强合作表示能力。

Result: 在StarCraft II和LBF任务中，CMQ性能优于现有方法，并能捕捉有意义的合作模式，支持概念干预检测偏差和伪影。

Conclusion: CMQ突破了性能与可解释性的权衡，为MARL提供了透明且高效的合作机制表示。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in applying neural networks (NN) to multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) areas, they still largely suffer from a lack of
transparency and interoperability. However, its implicit cooperative mechanism
is not yet fully understood due to black-box networks. In this work, we study
an interpretable value decomposition framework via concept bottleneck models,
which promote trustworthiness by conditioning credit assignment on an
intermediate level of human-like cooperation concepts. To address this problem,
we propose a novel value-based method, named Concepts learning for Multi-agent
Q-learning (CMQ), that goes beyond the current performance-vs-interpretability
trade-off by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. CMQ represents each
cooperation concept as a supervised vector, as opposed to existing models where
the information flowing through their end-to-end mechanism is concept-agnostic.
Intuitively, using individual action value conditioning on global state
embeddings to represent each concept allows for extra cooperation
representation capacity. Empirical evaluations on the StarCraft II
micromanagement challenge and level-based foraging (LBF) show that CMQ achieves
superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. The
results also demonstrate that CMQ provides more cooperation concept
representation capturing meaningful cooperation modes, and supports test-time
concept interventions for detecting potential biases of cooperation mode and
identifying spurious artifacts that impact cooperation.

Conclusion: 该研究为设计更安全、可信的AI系统提供了理论基础，将策略稳定性分析从经验启发提升到理论原则。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of
large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces
brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious
reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified
theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.
This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the
stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show
that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common
occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This
theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly
disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards
that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action
degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting
to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how
stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also
prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of
increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for
recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following
trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through
perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances
policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled
theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI
systems.

Result: HFrame能区分更多非同态图对，速度提升101.91倍，平均准确率0.962。

Conclusion: HFrame在子图同态问题上高效且准确，为图神经网络应用提供新方向。

Abstract: Homomorphism is a key mapping technique between graphs that preserves their
structure. Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem
involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that
adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph.
Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism
allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph,
making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based
framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms
with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms
standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs
where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a
generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world
and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than
exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.

coordinate a set of specialized agents to solve them. Our system achieved an F1
score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of complex chemical reaction graphics

Abstract: This paper presents the development of an AI powered software platform that
leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform technology
scouting and solution discovery in industrial R&D. Traditional approaches to
solving complex research and development challenges are often time consuming,
manually driven, and heavily dependent on domain specific expertise. These
methods typically involve navigating fragmented sources such as patent
repositories, commercial product catalogs, and competitor data, leading to
inefficiencies and incomplete insights. The proposed platform utilizes cutting
edge LLM capabilities including semantic understanding, contextual reasoning,
and cross-domain knowledge extraction to interpret problem statements and
retrieve high-quality, sustainable solutions. The system processes unstructured
patent texts, such as claims and technical descriptions, and systematically
extracts potential innovations aligned with the given problem context. These
solutions are then algorithmically organized under standardized technical
categories and subcategories to ensure clarity and relevance across
interdisciplinary domains. In addition to patent analysis, the platform
integrates commercial intelligence by identifying validated market solutions
and active organizations addressing similar challenges. This combined insight

Method: 通过可视化线性子空间和降维实验，验证高维表示对安全对齐的影响。

Result: 降维能有效减少模型被攻击的脆弱性，同时保留足够的安全对齐信息。

Conclusion: 高维表示在安全对齐中既是优势也是隐患，降维是一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The focus on safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) has increased
significantly due to their widespread adoption across different domains. The
scale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in
parameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize
that while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to
emergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in
the activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,
to circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear
subspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various
model scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations
uniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that
projecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace
can preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear
structures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction
significantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation
engineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical
insights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden
dimensions. Broadly speaking, our work posits that the high dimensions of a
model's internal representations can be both a blessing and a curse in safety
alignment.

Conclusion: VLMPlanner通过视觉上下文和动态推理机制，显著提升了自动驾驶规划的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into autonomous driving motion
planning has recently emerged as a promising direction, offering enhanced
interpretability, better controllability, and improved generalization in rare
and long-tail scenarios. However, existing methods often rely on abstracted
perception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as
fine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are
essential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge
this gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a
learning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of
reasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich,
detailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning
capabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe
trajectories. Furthermore, we develop the Context-Adaptive Inference Gate
(CAI-Gate) mechanism that enables the VLM to mimic human driving behavior by
dynamically adjusting its inference frequency based on scene complexity,
thereby achieving an optimal balance between planning performance and
computational efficiency. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale,
challenging nuPlan benchmark, with comprehensive experimental results
demonstrating superior planning performance in scenarios with intricate road
conditions and dynamic elements. Code will be available.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HAG-PS的多智能体强化学习方法，用于动态分配城市移动资源，解决了策略共享和内存效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市移动资源分配中多智能体强化学习的动态策略共享和内存效率挑战。

Method: 采用分层自适应分组参数共享（HAG-PS），结合全局和局部信息，动态分组智能体，并使用可学习的ID嵌入实现专业化。

Result: 基于纽约共享单车数据的实验显示，HAG-PS在资源可用性方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HAG-PS有效解决了移动资源分配中的动态策略共享和内存效率问题，提升了资源分配性能。

Abstract: Allocating mobility resources (e.g., shared bikes/e-scooters, ride-sharing
vehicles) is crucial for rebalancing the mobility demand and supply in the
urban environments. We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement
learning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS)
for dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important
research challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility
resource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility
resource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across
agents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources);
and (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale
setting. To address the above challenges, we have provided following novel
designs within HAG-PS. To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we
have designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local
information of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility
resources). We have developed an adaptive agent grouping approach in order to
split or merge the groups of agents based on their relative closeness of
encoded trajectories (i.e., states, actions, and rewards). We have designed a
learnable identity (ID) embeddings to enable agent specialization beyond simple
parameter copy. We have performed extensive experimental studies based on
real-world NYC bike sharing data (a total of more than 1.2 million trips), and
demonstrated the superior performance (e.g., improved bike availability) of
HAG-PS compared with other baseline approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在机器人和具身AI中的应用增加，评估其空间推理能力对实际部署至关重要，但目前缺乏相关研究。

Method: 通过坐标反馈和距离信息设计迷宫导航任务，评估8种LLM在英语和冰岛语中的表现。

Result: 模型性能差异显著，部分模型在较大迷宫中完全失败，且冰岛语表现明显弱于英语。

Conclusion: LLM的空间推理能力受训练数据和语言影响，需架构创新以实现跨语言可靠导航。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in
robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities
becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances
in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs
perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for
agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this
gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure
spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our
methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of
varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate
feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test
fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic
transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while
OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$,
other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100%
of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a
cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in
Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English,
suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather
than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications
for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial
intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability
and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable
navigation across linguistic contexts.

Abstract: In the context of the rapidly evolving information technology landscape,
marked by the advent of 6G communication networks, we face an increased data
volume and complexity in network environments. This paper addresses these
challenges by focusing on Quality of Service (QoS) in edge computing
frameworks. We propose a novel approach to enhance QoS through the development
of General Artificial Intelligence Lifelong Learning Systems, with a special
emphasis on Federated Layering Techniques (FLT). Our work introduces a
federated layering-based small model collaborative mechanism aimed at improving
AI models' operational efficiency and response time in environments where
resources are limited. This innovative method leverages the strengths of cloud
and edge computing, incorporating a negotiation and debate mechanism among
small AI models to enhance reasoning and decision-making processes. By
integrating model layering techniques with privacy protection measures, our
approach ensures the secure transmission of model parameters while maintaining
high efficiency in learning and reasoning capabilities. The experimental
results demonstrate that our strategy not only enhances learning efficiency and
reasoning accuracy but also effectively protects the privacy of edge nodes.
This presents a viable solution for achieving resilient large model lifelong
learning systems, with a significant improvement in QoS for edge computing
environments.

Motivation: 准确预测交通事故严重程度对提升道路安全、优化应急响应策略和设计更安全的交通基础设施至关重要，但现有方法难以有效建模复杂的时空和上下文变量关系。

Method: 提出STARN-GAT模型，结合道路网络拓扑、时间交通模式和环境上下文，采用注意力机制统一建模。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic accident severity is critical for improving
road safety, optimizing emergency response strategies, and informing the design
of safer transportation infrastructure. However, existing approaches often
struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial,
temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this
study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention
Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware
attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike
conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal
traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based
framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System
(FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and
recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within
the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic
accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78,
and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time,
safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based
architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing
factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT
bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical
applications in road safety analytics.

Conclusion: 结论强调当前AI代理存在严重漏洞，需要额外防御措施，并希望通过ART基准测试推动更安全的代理部署。

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute
complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web
access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in
realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the
largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents
across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million
prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy
violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and
regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming
(ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across
19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for
most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across
models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent
robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting
that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings
highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By
releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to
support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent
deployment.

Result: 在基准和实际问题中，MeLA生成的启发式更有效且鲁棒，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合认知科学的元认知框架为AHD提供了更鲁棒和可解释的路径。

Abstract: This paper introduces MeLA, a Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture that
presents a new paradigm for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). Traditional
evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA
evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in
generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a
novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to
systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a
problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis
system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that
iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In
comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA
consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates
the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI
architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its
problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图中存在过时或错误信息，需在不破坏其余知识完整性的前提下移除。现有遗忘方法成本高或效果不佳。

Method: 提出GraphDPO框架，将遗忘问题转化为偏好优化问题，通过直接偏好优化（DPO）训练模型，并引入边界外采样和边界回忆机制。

Result: 在四个流行知识图上构建的八个遗忘数据集中，GraphDPO在MRR_Avg和MRR_F1上分别优于基线方法10.1%和14.0%。

Conclusion: GraphDPO通过偏好优化和边界知识保护，显著提升了知识图遗忘的效果。

Abstract: Existing knowledge graphs (KGs) inevitably contain outdated or erroneous
knowledge that needs to be removed from knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models.
To address this challenge, knowledge unlearning can be applied to eliminate
specific information while preserving the integrity of the remaining knowledge
in KGs. Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact
unlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high
training costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to
KGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove
targeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from
remaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which
weakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these
issues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on
direct preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting
triples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the
model is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original
forgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable
knowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.
Moreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct
preference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection
between forgetting and retained knowledge. Secondly, to preserve boundary
knowledge, we introduce a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills
relevant information both within and across time steps. We construct eight
unlearning datasets across four popular KGs with varying unlearning rates.
Experiments show that GraphDPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to
10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1.

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5 7B和13B等基准数据集上表现优于SparseGPT和Wanda等现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自动分配KV缓存压缩资源，在保持性能的同时显著提升了内存效率，为LMM优化设定了新标准。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have advanced significantly by integrating
visual encoders with extensive language models, enabling robust reasoning
capabilities. However, compressing LMMs for deployment on edge devices remains
a critical challenge. In this work, we propose an adaptive search algorithm
that optimizes sparsity and KV cache compression to enhance LMM efficiency.
Utilizing the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, our method dynamically adjusts
pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth across different LMM layers,
using model performance as the optimization objective. This approach uniquely
combines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast
pruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight
adjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy.
Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and
13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such
as SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels. Notably, our
framework automatic allocation of KV cache compression resources sets a new
standard in LMM optimization, delivering memory efficiency without sacrificing
much performance.

Conclusion: MoCME通过利用多模态互补性和动态负采样，显著提升了多模态知识图谱补全的效果。

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world
knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and
structural entity information. However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal
knowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses
challenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity
representation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or
gate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in
multi-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of
Complementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a
Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an
Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits
both intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and
multi-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we
introduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically
prioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training
effectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing approaches.

Abstract: At present, state-of-the-art forecasting models are short of the ability to
capture spatio-temporal dependency and synthesize global information at the
stage of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive
fuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional
architecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding
window to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction
strategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short
and long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to
automatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships
among them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require
human involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce
calculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global
characteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing
redundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a
partially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly
mine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which
gives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct
sub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained
level. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the
multi-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the
corresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with
other competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
results on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the
experimental results.

Motivated by the execution and monitoring of these plans, we study Dynamic MAPF
(D-MAPF) problem, which allows changes such as agents entering/leaving the

real-world applications in warehouses with the presence of humans, we introduce
1) a general definition for D-MAPF (applicable to variations of D-MAPF), 2) a
new framework to solve D-MAPF (utilizing multi-shot computation, and allowing
different methods to solve D-MAPF), and 3) a new ASP-based method to solve
D-MAPF (combining advantages of replanning and repairing methods, with a novel
concept of tunnels to specify where agents can move). We have illustrated the
strengths and weaknesses of this method by experimental evaluations, from the

Abstract: Fairness in AI is traditionally studied as a static property evaluated once,
over a fixed dataset. However, real-world AI systems operate sequentially, with
outcomes and environments evolving over time. This paper proposes a framework
for analysing fairness as a runtime property. Using a minimal yet expressive
model based on sequences of coin tosses with possibly evolving biases, we study
the problems of monitoring and enforcing fairness expressed in either toss
outcomes or coin biases. Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution for
either problem, we provide a summary of monitoring and enforcement strategies,
parametrised by environment dynamics, prediction horizon, and confidence
thresholds. For both problems, we present general results under simple or
minimal assumptions. We survey existing solutions for the monitoring problem
for Markovian and additive dynamics, and existing solutions for the enforcement
problem in static settings with known dynamics.

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地反映社会的多样化价值系统，为伦理AI提供支持。

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values and the value-based preferences of
various stakeholders (their value systems) is key in ethical AI. In value-aware
AI systems, decision-making draws upon explicit computational representations
of individual values (groundings) and their aggregation into value systems. As
these are notoriously difficult to elicit and calibrate manually, value
learning approaches aim to automatically derive computational models of an
agent's values and value system from demonstrations of human behaviour.
Nonetheless, social science and humanities literature suggest that it is more
adequate to conceive the value system of a society as a set of value systems of
different groups, rather than as the simple aggregation of individual value
systems. Accordingly, here we formalize the problem of learning the value
systems of societies and propose a method to address it based on heuristic deep
clustering. The method learns socially shared value groundings and a set of
diverse value systems representing a given society by observing qualitative
value-based preferences from a sample of agents. We evaluate the proposal in a
use case with real data about travelling decisions.

TL;DR: AI模型通过优化电话干预时间提升听众参与度，并显著改善母婴健康行为和知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有健康信息自动电话服务中听众流失和参与度低的问题，验证AI干预是否能转化为实际健康行为改善。

Method: 利用AI模型（如多臂老虎机模型）识别最需要干预的受益者，优化电话服务时间，提升听众参与度。

Result: AI干预显著提高了听众参与度，并带来健康行为（如产后补铁补钙）和健康知识的显著改善。

Conclusion: AI在提升母婴健康行为和知识方面具有潜力，为健康干预提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated voice calls with health information are a proven method for
disseminating maternal and child health information among beneficiaries and are
deployed in several programs around the world. However, these programs often
suffer from beneficiary dropoffs and poor engagement. In previous work, through
real-world trials, we showed that an AI model, specifically a restless bandit
model, could identify beneficiaries who would benefit most from live service
call interventions, preventing dropoffs and boosting engagement. However, one
key question has remained open so far: does such improved listenership via
AI-targeted interventions translate into beneficiaries' improved knowledge and
health behaviors? We present a first study that shows not only listenership
improvements due to AI interventions, but also simultaneously links these
improvements to health behavior changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that
AI-scheduled interventions, which enhance listenership, lead to statistically
significant improvements in beneficiaries' health behaviors such as taking iron
or calcium supplements in the postnatal period, as well as understanding of
critical health topics during pregnancy and infancy. This underscores the
potential of AI to drive meaningful improvements in maternal and child health.

TL;DR: 论文分析了Chain-of-Thought (CoT)提示的内部机制，发现其通过解码空间剪枝和任务依赖的神经元调节提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CoT显著提升了模型推理能力，但其内部机制尚不明确，研究旨在揭示其运作原理。

Method: 通过反向追踪信息流（解码、投影、激活阶段）进行定量分析。

Result: CoT可能作为解码空间剪枝器，利用答案模板引导输出；神经元激活在开放和封闭任务中表现不同。

Conclusion: 研究提供了CoT的机制解释框架，为设计高效提示提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances model reasoning, yet
its internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. We analyze CoT's operational
principles by reversely tracing information flow across decoding, projection,
and activation phases. Our quantitative analysis suggests that CoT may serve as
a decoding space pruner, leveraging answer templates to guide output
generation, with higher template adherence strongly correlating with improved
performance. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that CoT modulates neuron
engagement in a task-dependent manner: reducing neuron activation in
open-domain tasks, yet increasing it in closed-domain scenarios. These findings
offer a novel mechanistic interpretability framework and critical insights for
enabling targeted CoT interventions to design more efficient and robust
prompts. We released our code and data at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标（如BLEU和ROUGE）无法捕捉领域特定细节，而人工评估成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 开发了evalSmarT框架，支持400多种评估配置，结合40种LLMs和10种提示策略。

Result: 结果表明提示设计显著影响与人类判断的一致性，LLM评估提供了可扩展且语义丰富的替代方案。

Conclusion: LLM为基础的评估是现有方法的有效替代，尤其在智能合约注释生成领域。

Abstract: Smart contract comment generation has gained traction as a means to improve
code comprehension and maintainability in blockchain systems. However,
evaluating the quality of generated comments remains a challenge. Traditional
metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture domain-specific nuances, while
human evaluation is costly and unscalable. In this paper, we present
\texttt{evalSmarT}, a modular and extensible framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as evaluators. The system supports over 400 evaluator
configurations by combining approximately 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies.
We demonstrate its application in benchmarking comment generation tools and
selecting the most informative outputs. Our results show that prompt design
significantly impacts alignment with human judgment, and that LLM-based
evaluation offers a scalable and semantically rich alternative to existing
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在多模态信息融合和知识结构捕捉上存在不足，且需要大规模任务特定训练，泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出MMGraphRAG，利用场景图细化视觉内容，构建MMKG，结合文本知识图谱，通过谱聚类实现跨模态实体链接，并沿推理路径检索上下文指导生成。

Result: 在DocBench和MMLongBench数据集上达到最优性能，展现出强大的领域适应性和清晰的推理路径。

Conclusion: MMGraphRAG通过多模态知识图谱和推理路径检索，显著提升了生成模型的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language model generation by
retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases. However,
conventional RAG methods face the issue of missing multimodal information.
Multimodal RAG methods address this by fusing images and text through mapping
them into a shared embedding space, but they fail to capture the structure of
knowledge and logical chains between modalities. Moreover, they also require
large-scale training for specific tasks, resulting in limited generalizing
ability. To address these limitations, we propose MMGraphRAG, which refines
visual content through scene graphs and constructs a multimodal knowledge graph
(MMKG) in conjunction with text-based KG. It employs spectral clustering to
achieve cross-modal entity linking and retrieves context along reasoning paths
to guide the generative process. Experimental results show that MMGraphRAG
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocBench and MMLongBench datasets,
demonstrating strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning paths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线算法无法扩展到大规模POMDP，而在线方法在时间或能量受限的应用中不适用。

Method: POMCGS算法动态折叠搜索树构建策略图，结合动作渐进扩展和观测聚类方法，支持连续POMDP。

Result: POMCGS能处理现有离线算法无法解决的挑战性POMDP，且策略性能与先进在线算法相当。

Conclusion: POMCGS为大规模POMDP提供了一种高效的离线解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Currently, large partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are
often solved by sampling-based online methods which interleave planning and
execution phases. However, a pre-computed offline policy is more desirable in
POMDP applications with time or energy constraints. But previous offline
algorithms are not able to scale up to large POMDPs. In this article, we
propose a new sampling-based algorithm, the partially observable Monte-Carlo
graph search (POMCGS) to solve large POMDPs offline. Different from many online
POMDP methods, which progressively develop a tree while performing
(Monte-Carlo) simulations, POMCGS folds this search tree on the fly to
construct a policy graph, so that computations can be drastically reduced, and
users can analyze and validate the policy prior to embedding and executing it.
Moreover, POMCGS, together with action progressive widening and observation
clustering methods provided in this article, is able to address certain
continuous POMDPs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that POMCGS can generate
policies on the most challenging POMDPs, which cannot be computed by previous
offline algorithms, and these policies' values are competitive compared with
the state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型神经语言模型的推理限制，解释其在高阶逻辑表达上的不足，为未来模型架构扩展和可解释性策略提供理论基础。

Method: 将神经网络视为逻辑谓词空间上的线性算子，分析每层的逻辑表达能力，证明深度与逻辑表达上限的关系。

Result: 发现神经网络无法忠实表示高阶逻辑（如复杂谓词上的简单计数），揭示了其推理能力的严格限制。

Conclusion: 该框架解释了幻觉、重复和有限规划等现象，为未来语言模型的发展提供了理论指导和改进方向。

Abstract: We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models
for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating
neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that
each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We
prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully
represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over
complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness.
This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and
embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our
framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination,
repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for
understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These
results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in
future development of language models.

TL;DR: 提出了首个可实现的修正性框架，在多步、部分可观测环境中提供可证明的保障。通过五个结构分离的效用头取代单一奖励，结合严格权重差，确保安全性和人类利益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如Constitutional AI或RLHF/RLAIF）将所有规范合并为一个标量的问题，通过分离效用头确保修正性在激励冲突时仍占主导。

Method: 使用五个分离的效用头（顺从性、开关访问保护、真实性、低影响行为和有限任务奖励），通过严格权重差结合，并在理论和实验上证明其有效性。

Result: 在部分可观测的开关游戏中实现单轮修正性，并扩展到多步自生成代理，证明即使学习误差存在，安全性和人类利益仍可保障。

Conclusion: 框架将奖励黑客风险转移到评估质量上，为当前LLM助手和未来自主系统提供了清晰的实现指导。

Abstract: We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with
provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our
framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate*
utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness,
low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility
Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict
weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially
observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,
self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to
mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,
the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still
ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF,
which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience
and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended
settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether
an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by
reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable
island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and
verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.
Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage
and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality
rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation
guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.

Result: MIRAGE-Bench能够规模化、高保真地评估代理行为，揭示失败模式，为减少幻觉提供基础。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为交互环境中幻觉行为的系统性研究和缓解提供了重要工具和理论基础。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based
agents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or
misinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies
have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a
principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions
in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and
evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by
introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions
that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii)
environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by
performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize
test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in
deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we
adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware
prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without
enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on
failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in
mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.

Result: 提高了求解性能，减少了计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法有效优化了交互式配置系统的性能，并通过API支持用户界面实现。

Abstract: Product configuration is a successful application of Answer Set Programming
(ASP). However, challenges are still open for interactive systems to
effectively guide users through the configuration process. The aim of our work
is to provide an ASP-based solver for interactive configuration that can deal
with large-scale industrial configuration problems and that supports intuitive
user interfaces via an API. In this paper, we focus on improving the
performance of automatically completing a partial configuration. Our main
contribution enhances the classical incremental approach for multi-shot solving
by four different smart expansion functions. The core idea is to determine and
add specific objects or associations to the partial configuration by exploiting
cautious and brave consequences before checking for the existence of a complete
configuration with the current objects in each iteration. This approach limits
the number of costly unsatisfiability checks and reduces the search space,
thereby improving solving performance. In addition, we present a user interface
that uses our API and is implemented in ASP.

TL;DR: GenoMAS是一个基于LLM的团队协作系统，结合结构化工作流和自主代理的灵活性，用于基因表达分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基因表达分析的自动化方法要么过于僵化，要么缺乏科学严谨性，GenoMAS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GenoMAS通过六个专门的LLM代理协作，采用类型化消息传递协议和引导规划框架，动态调整分析流程。

Result: 在GenoTEX基准测试中，GenoMAS在数据预处理和基因识别任务上分别比现有最佳方法提高了10.61%和16.85%。

Conclusion: GenoMAS不仅性能优越，还能发现生物学上合理的基因-表型关联，同时调整潜在混杂因素。

Abstract: Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet
extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the
complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive
domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either
inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous
agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry.
GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists
that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability
of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through
typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a
shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning
framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action
Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack,
thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the
idiosyncrasies of genomic data.
  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation
of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene
identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85%
respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible
gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting
for latent confounders. Code is available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoMAS.

Result: 提供了自进化智能体的系统框架，涵盖应用领域（如编程、教育、医疗）和评估指标，并指出未来挑战。

Conclusion: 论文为自进化智能体的研究和实际应用提供了路线图，推动实现超越人类智能的人工超级智能（ASI）。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain
fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,
evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are
increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static
nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can
adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from
scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing
interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and
adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the
first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized
around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how
to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,
models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages
(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and
architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,
textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we
analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,
highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,
and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,
scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework
for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a
roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world
deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of
Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,
performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification
(benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention
stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones --
EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 -- are each adapted with a
custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage
attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores
from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final
prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ
dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp
augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference.
Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance,
achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in
error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced
performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with
particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement
was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these
improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a
robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.
