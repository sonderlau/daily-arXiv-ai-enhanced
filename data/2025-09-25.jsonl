Yet growing skepticism surrounds their reliability. How can we\nknow that a reported accuracy genuinely reflects a model's true performance?\nEvaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are\ninferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to\nassume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make\nthis step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as\ninference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for\nestimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has\nnot yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address\na central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations.\nAfter formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability\nwhile accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including\nan adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity. Together,\nthese contributions lay the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy\nestimates of AI capabilities as measured through benchmarks."}

As organ size differs\nby sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in\nlower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men.\nWhile previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets,\nno study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself.\nThis study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC\nin an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied\nequally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants\nto ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary\nshift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,\naverage DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around\n0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,\nwith sex-based DSC differences close to zero. These findings underline that\nfairness studies using the DSC as an evaluation metric should not expect\nidentical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A\nsegmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error\nmagnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. Importantly, our work\nraises awareness of a previously underexplored source of sex-based differences\nin segmentation performance.

Most recent decomposition methods\nsegment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called\nsuperpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment\nstandard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without\ndistortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called\nSphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide\n360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of\nthe 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path\nbetween a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering\nfeatures. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space\nto compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation\naccuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity\naspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space,\naddressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure.\nFinally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o\nspherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional\nimages. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical\nstate-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to\nnoise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based\napplications on 360o images."}

However, existing IML methods\nremain manipulation-process-agnostic, directly producing localization masks in\na one-shot prediction paradigm without modeling the underlying editing steps.\nThis one-shot paradigm compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into\na single binary mask, inducing severe dimensional collapse, thereby creating a\nfundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the IML task.\n  To address this, we are the first to reformulate image manipulation\nlocalization as a conditional sequence prediction task, proposing the RITA\nframework. RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered\nmanner, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next, thereby\nexplicitly modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures among\nediting operations.\n  To enable training and evaluation, we synthesize multi-step manipulation data\nand construct a new benchmark HSIM.

Mammography is essential for the\nearly detection and diagnosis of breast lesions. Despite recent progress in\nfoundation models (FMs) for mammogram analysis, their clinical translation\nremains constrained by several fundamental limitations, including insufficient\ndiversity in training data, limited model generalizability, and a lack of\ncomprehensive evaluation across clinically relevant tasks. Here, we introduce\nVersaMammo, a versatile foundation model for mammograms, designed to overcome\nthese limitations. We curated the largest multi-institutional mammogram dataset\nto date, comprising 706,239 images from 21 sources. To improve generalization,\nwe propose a two-stage pre-training strategy to develop VersaMammo, a mammogram\nfoundation model. First, a teacher model is trained via self-supervised\nlearning to extract transferable features from unlabeled mammograms. Then,\nsupervised learning combined with knowledge distillation transfers both\nfeatures and clinical knowledge into VersaMammo. To ensure a comprehensive\nevaluation, we established a benchmark comprising 92 specific tasks, including\n68 internal tasks and 24 external validation tasks, spanning 5 major clinical\ntask categories: lesion detection, segmentation, classification, image\nretrieval, and visual question answering. VersaMammo achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, ranking first in 50 out of 68 specific internal tasks and 20 out\nof 24 external validation tasks, with average ranks of 1.5 and 1.2,\nrespectively. These results demonstrate its superior generalization and\nclinical utility, offering a substantial advancement toward reliable and\nscalable breast cancer screening and diagnosis."}

However, existing mainstream methods based on CNN-Transformer hybrid\narchitectures typically employ simple feature fusion techniques such as serial\nstacking, endpoint concatenation, or pointwise addition, which struggle to\naddress the inconsistencies between features and are prone to information\nconflict and loss. To address the aforementioned challenges, we innovatively\npropose HiPerformer. The encoder of HiPerformer employs a novel modular\nhierarchical architecture that dynamically fuses multi-source features in\nparallel, enabling layer-wise deep integration of heterogeneous information.\nThe modular hierarchical design not only retains the independent modeling\ncapability of each branch in the encoder, but also ensures sufficient\ninformation transfer between layers, effectively avoiding the degradation of\nfeatures and information loss that come with traditional stacking methods.\nFurthermore, we design a Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module to achieve\nprecise and efficient integration of local details and global semantic\ninformation, effectively alleviating the feature inconsistency problem and\nresulting in a more comprehensive feature representation. To further enhance\nmulti-scale feature representation capabilities and suppress noise\ninterference, we also propose a Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module to\nreplace traditional skip connections. Experiments on eleven public datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing segmentation\ntechniques, demonstrating higher segmentation accuracy and robustness.

Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial\nregions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between\nanomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of\ncontrollable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring\ntwo novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the\nForeground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling\nalgorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly\nsynthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine\naggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented\nanomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the\nanomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step,\npreserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory.\nExtensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST\nconsistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream\nsegmentation tasks.

To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous\nsolutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress\nin this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the\nlack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field\ndeployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study\npresents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models\nfor deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of\nthis work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available\ndataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer,\nderived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive\ncomparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO\narchitectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a\nhigh-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing\nplatforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the\nreal-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific\nmodel optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with\nGPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals\nthat smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and\nYOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and\ncomputational efficiency (FPS > 30).

An essential yet\nchallenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures\naccurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse\norientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose\nconditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting\nthe optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional\nparameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.\n  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the\nreference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex\nattention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this\npure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing\nperformance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional\nparameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose\nstitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose\npreservation and output realism. Additionally, we introduce a mixed-mask\ntraining strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks, allowing the model\nto support flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions."}
