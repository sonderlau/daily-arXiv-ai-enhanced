### [1] [Multi-Plasticity Synergy with Adaptive Mechanism Assignment for Training Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13673)
*Yuzhe Liu,Xin Deng,Qiang Yu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合多种协同可塑性机制的生��启发式SNN训练框架，相比传统单一机制模型显著提升了性能和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SNN训练方法通常依赖单一突触可塑性形式，限制了适应性和表征能力，而大脑中存在多种共存的学习策略

Method: 生物启发训练框架，整合多种协同可塑性机制，使不同学习算法能够协作调节信息积累，同时保持各自相对独立的更新动态

Result: 在静态图像和动态神经形态数据集上的评估表明，该框架相比传统学习机制模型显著提高了性能和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 为开发基于多策略脑启发学习的更强大SNN提供了通用且可扩展的基础

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising brain-inspired models known for
low power consumption and superior potential for temporal processing, but
identifying suitable learning mechanisms remains a challenge. Despite the
presence of multiple coexisting learning strategies in the brain, current SNN
training methods typically rely on a single form of synaptic plasticity, which
limits their adaptability and representational capability. In this paper, we
propose a biologically inspired training framework that incorporates multiple
synergistic plasticity mechanisms for more effective SNN training. Our method
enables diverse learning algorithms to cooperatively modulate the accumulation
of information, while allowing each mechanism to preserve its own relatively
independent update dynamics. We evaluated our approach on both static image and
dynamic neuromorphic datasets to demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves performance and robustness compared to conventional learning mechanism
models. This work provides a general and extensible foundation for developing
more powerful SNNs guided by multi-strategy brain-inspired learning.

### [3] [Zobrist Hash-based Duplicate Detection in Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13859)
*Bogdan Burlacu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Zobrist哈希的缓存机制，用于提高遗传编程符号回归的效率，避免重复计算，在保持搜索质量的同时实现高达34%的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遗传编程在符号回归中会重复访问和评估搜索空间中的相同点，导致计算资源浪费，需要一种机制来避免这种重复计算。

Method: 采用Zobrist哈希技术构建缓存机制，在开源框架Operon中实现，用于高效存储和检索已评估的数学表达式。

Result: 在真实世界回归问题上测试，实现了高达34%的速度提升，且对搜索质量没有负面影响。

Conclusion: Zobrist哈希缓存是一种简单有效的方法，既能提高运行时性能，又为基于缓存信息调整搜索策略提供了可能性。

Abstract: Symbolic regression encompasses a family of search algorithms that aim to
discover the best fitting function for a set of data without requiring an a
priori specification of the model structure. The most successful and commonly
used technique for symbolic regression is Genetic Programming (GP), an
evolutionary search method that evolves a population of mathematical
expressions through the mechanism of natural selection. In this work we analyze
the efficiency of the evolutionary search in GP and show that many points in
the search space are re-visited and re-evaluated multiple times by the
algorithm, leading to wasted computational effort. We address this issue by
introducing a caching mechanism based on the Zobrist hash, a type of hashing
frequently used in abstract board games for the efficient construction and
subsequent update of transposition tables. We implement our caching approach
using the open-source framework Operon and demonstrate its performance on a
selection of real-world regression problems, where we observe up to 34\%
speedups without any detrimental effects on search quality. The hashing
approach represents a straightforward way to improve runtime performance while
also offering some interesting possibilities for adjusting search strategy
based on cached information.

### [4] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了YOLO11-CR模型，一种专门用于实时空闲检测的轻量级对象检测方案，通过卷积波和注意力融合模块以及矩形校准模块显著提升了小物体和遮挡物体的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的驾驶呕低检测方法存在争议：生理和车辆动力学方法虽准确但侵入性强且硬件依赖，而视觉方法虽非侵入性但在小物体检测、遮挡处理和多尺度特征建模方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出YOLO11-CR模型，包含两个核心模块：1）卷积与注意力融合模块（CAFM），结合CNN局部特征和Transformer全局上下文；2）矩形校准模块（RCM），捕获水平和垂直上下文信息以改善空间定位。

Result: 在DSM数据集上，YOLO11-CR达到了87.17%的精度、83.86%的回扫率、88.09%的mAP@50和55.93%的mAP@50-95，显著超过基线模型。分离实验证明了CAFM和RCM模块在提高敏感性和定位精度方面的有效性。

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车内空闲监测提供了一种实用且高性能的解决方案，具有强大的实际部署潜力，并为未来时序建模、多模态数据集成和嵌入式优化提供了发展空间。

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

### [5] [Timestep-Compressed Attack on Spiking Neural Networks through Timestep-Level Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13812)
*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Hyeongboo Baek,Brent ByungHoon Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了TCA（时间步压缩攻击）框架，通过TLBP和A-MPR技术显著减少SNN对抗攻击的延迟，相比SOTA方法降低56.6-57.1%的延迟，同时保持相似的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的SNN对抗攻击方法（如FGSM和PGD扩展）存在严重延迟问题，因为它们直接扩展ANN范式，未能充分利用SNN的关键特性，导致多时间步处理产生大量攻击延迟，不适用于实时应用。

Method: TCA框架包含两个核心组件：1）时间步级反向传播（TLBP）- 基于发现全局时间信息对攻击成功不关键，支持逐时间步评估和早期停止；2）对抗性膜电位重用（A-MPR）- 利用初始时间步低效积累膜电位的特点，预计算并重用这个预热阶段。

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17上使用CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集的实验表明，TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别比SOTA方法减少56.6%和57.1%的攻击延迟，同时保持可比的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA通过有效利用SNN的时间特性，显著降低了对抗攻击的延迟，为SNN在实时应用中的安全部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型，用于检测真实世界中的AI生成图像，相比现有方法在Mirage基准和公共基准上分别领先5%和10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI生成图像检测器在实验室干净环境下有效，但无法泛化到真实世界的嘈杂场景，这些图像质量参差不齐且经过多重编辑，对信息安全构成威胁。

Method: 构建Mirage基准（包含互联网收集和专家合成的AI生成图像），提出Mirage-R1视觉语言模型，采用启发式到分析式推理机制，通过监督微调和强化学习两阶段训练，并采用推理时自适应思考策略。

Result: 在Mirage基准和公共基准上分别比最先进检测器领先5%和10%，能够有效平衡推理速度和性能。

Conclusion: Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型为真实世界AI生成图像检测提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [7] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1是一个推理增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过结合自身OCR能力和调用专家模型工具，有效减少幻觉问题并提升OCR任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在文档图像解析中容易出现幻觉问题，且在OCR任务上不如专门训练的专家模型有效，需要解决这些局限性

Method: 提出推理-工具交织的训练框架，模型先自行识别图像内容，然后调用专家模型工具获取参考结果，最后重新审视图像并推理生成最终识别结果

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench基准测试中，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理版本和专家OCR模型，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 通过结合自身OCR能力和专家模型工具，推理增强的视觉语言模型能够有效减少幻觉问题，以较低成本实现性能提升

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络的两层级结构实现乌尔都语光学字符识别，通过组件分类方法避免切分错误，组件分类准确率达5230.99%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为一种草书脚本语言，具有复杂的几何和形态结构，传统的切分基于识别方法错误率较高

Method: 采用卷积神经网络进行自动特征学习，通过三个字符的排列组合生成数据集，使连通组件技术获取细体，并使用两层层次神经网络处理三级字符排列和组件分类

Result: 模型在组件分类任务上达到了30.99%的高准确率

Conclusion: 组件基于的CNN方法能够有效处理乌尔都语识别的挑战，避免了切分方法的高错误率问题

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE是一个课程学习框架，通过图像质量评估标签可靠性并结合序数结构，提升溃疡性结肠炎内镜图像严重程度分类的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mayo内镜评分(MES)分类面临标签噪声和序数性质的双重挑战，传统模型往往忽略这些因素，需要新的训练策略来提高分类性能

Method: 使用基于波士顿肠道准备量表(BBPS)的轻量级模型估计图像质量作为标注置信度代理，构建从易到难的课程学习顺序，结合ResizeMix增强提高鲁棒性

Result: 在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上，CLoE在CNN和Transformer架构上均表现优异，ConvNeXt-Tiny达到82.5%准确率和0.894 QWK，计算成本低

Conclusion: 难度感知的训练策略能有效改善标签不确定性下的序数分类性能，CLoE框架具有实际应用潜力

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter是一个基于扩散模型的步态序列生成框架，能够在轮廓域合成逼真的步态数据，支持多种条件控制，并能生成新身份数据以保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态识别缺乏大规模标注数据集，收集多样化步态样本困难且涉及隐私问题，需要一种能够生成高质量、可控且保护隐私的步态数据的方法。

Method: 训练一个专门针对步态轮廓数据的视频扩散模型，从零开始生成时间一致且保持身份特征的步态序列，支持基于服装、携带物品和视角等条件的可控生成。

Result: 将GaitCrafter生成的合成样本加入步态识别流程能提升性能，特别是在挑战性条件下；通过身份嵌入插值能生成不在原始数据集中的新身份数据。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了利用扩散模型进行高质量、可控且保护隐私的步态数据生成的重要进展，为步态识别提供了有效的数据增强和隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

Conclusion: Prune2Drive有效解决了多视角VLM的计算瓶颈问题，提供了高效的视觉token剪枝方案，在保持任务性能的同时显著提升推理效率，适用于现代高效注意力实现。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微分的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚Lp约束攻击的见解是否能有效提升感知效果。

Method: 多阶段框架，每阶段聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，使用学习到的自适应权重，并通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著优于最先进的感知攻击AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，视觉质量指标（SSIM、LPIPS、FID）均有显著改善。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，是评估鲁棒性的实用强基线，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗健康领域存在计算成本高、访问性限制和数据隐私问题，需要探索更实用的解决方案

Method: 使用NIH胸部X光数据集，测试多个小型语言模型在胸部X光位置分类任务中的表现，比较三种提示策略：基准指令、增量摘要提示和更正反思提示

Result: 某些小型语言模型通过精心设计的提示策略可以达到竞争性的准确度

Conclusion: 提示工程可以在不需要深度AI专业知识的情况下显著提升小型语言模型在医疗健康应用中的性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

### [16] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文发现多选题视觉问答数据集中存在"易选项偏差"(EOB)问题，视觉-语言模型只需看图片和选项就能猜出正确答案，无需问题信息。研究人员开发了GroundAttack工具来生成难度更高的负面选项，创建了无EOB偏差的新数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多选题视觉问答数据集中存在明显的偏差，模型可以通过简单的视觉-选项相似性匹配来猜测答案，而不需要理解问题内容，这影响了对模型真实能力的评估。

Method: 通过grounding实验证明了EOB问题的存在，归因于正确答案与视视频内容在特征空间中的不平衡对齐。开发了GroundAttack工具框架，自动生成视觉上可信的难负面选项。

Result: 在新创建的EOB-free数据集上，当前的视觉-语言模型在仅使用视觉+选项的设置下几乎达到随机水平的准确率，在完整输入(视觉+问题+选项)下也下降到非饼和水平。

Conclusion: 论文提出的EOB问题和GroundAttack解决方案能够更准确地评估视觉-语言模型的真实问答能力，为建立更可靠的测试数据集提供了方法。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

TL;DR: 通过结构化提示和知识蓄粉框架，使用大型视觉-语言模型生成高质量交通场景注释，训练出细小的VISTA模型，在保持性能的同时实现高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在可扩展性和通用性方面遇到困难，特别是在复杂动态的实际环境中。需要一种能够自动生成高质量交通场景注释和风险评估的方法。

Method: 采用结构化提示和知识蓄粉框架，使用GPT-4o和o3-mini两个大型VLMs通过结构化思维链策略生成多视角输出，作为知识富雅的伪注释用于监督细调小型学生VLM。

Result: 得到的VISTA模型只有3B参数，能够理解低分辨率交通视频并生成语义准确的风险意识描述，在BLEU-4、METEOR、ROUGE-L和CIDEr等指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: 有效的知识蓄粉和结构化多代理监督能够让轻量级VLMs掌握复杂的推理能力，细小的架构有助于在边缘设备上高效部署，实现实时风险监控。

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Conclusion: EDTalk++通过全解耦框架成功解决了面部特征独立控制和多模态输入兼容的问题，为可控说话头生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Motivation: 肾结石分类对个性化治疗和预防复发至关重要，但CNN模型在抓取长距离依赖关系方面有限

Method: 采用ImageNet-21k预训练的ViT-base模型与ResNet50基线模型进行对比分析，测试两个ex vivo数据集（CCD相机和腾穿镜图像）

Result: ViT模型在所有图像条件下都超过CNN。在最复杂的腾穿镜图像子集中，ViT达到95.2%准确率和95.1% F1分数，而ResNet50仅有64.5%和59.3%。混合视角子集中ViT也达到87.1%准确率

Conclusion: ViT基础架构提供了更优的分类性能，是肾结石图像分析中CNN的可扩展替代方案

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

TL;DR: MINR通过共享中间层来高效编码多图像，在保持性能的同时减少60%参数，可扩展到处理100张图像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的隐式神经表示(INR)为每张图像使用单独的MLP，导致编码多图像时计算和存储效率低下

Method: 分析训练好的INR层间权重分布，发现中间层分布模式高度相似，因此共享中间层而保留输入输出层为图像特定，并为每张图像设计额外的投影层来捕获独特特征

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，MINR可节省60%参数同时保持可比性能，能有效扩展到处理100张图像，平均PSNR达34dB

Conclusion: MINR方法在多图像编码中具有高效性和可扩展性，各种骨干网络的进一步分析证明了其鲁棒性

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ是一种针对隐式神经表示(INRs)的分布感知哈达玛量化方案，通过哈达玛变换将权重和激活值的不同分布统一为标准钟形分布，然后应用标准量化器，显著提升了硬件效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的INR量化方法主要关注权重量化，缺乏激活量化，硬件节省有限。INRs需要全精度计算导致显著的硬件开销，需要一种同时量化权重和激活值的方法来充分利用量化的硬件优势。

Method: 提出DHQ方案：1）分析发现INRs中首尾层权重和激活值的分布与其他层不同；2）使用哈达玛变换将这些不同分布统一为标准钟形分布；3）应用标准量化器进行量化；4）在FPGA上实现硬件高效的设计。

Result: 在多种图像重建任务上的实验表明，DHQ相比全精度版本：延迟降低32.7%，能耗降低40.1%，资源利用率最高降低98.3%，优于之前的量化方法。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的哈达玛量化方案，成功实现了INRs中权重和激活值的有效量化，显著提升了硬件效率，为INRs的实际部署提供了可行的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: FAMNet通过2D/3D CNN融合和多任务学习有效提取了微表情的全方位特征，显著提升了微表情识别的性能

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Result: 在具有高噪声水平的Dual-Radar数据集上进行广泛评估，证明该框架在增强检测鲁棒性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: CORENet相比现有主流方法实现了更优越的性能，为解决4D雷达点云稀疏和噪声问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

*Shihao Dong,Yuhui Zheng,Huiying Xu,Xinzhong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出BDCL框架，通过双级解耦和一致性学习提升多视图聚类的特征表示质量，增强簇间区分性和簇内紧凑性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图聚类虽然能通过利用视图间一致性和互补性提升性能，但往往忽视了面向聚类的表示学习，需要进一步探索有效的特征表示来增强簇间区分性和簇内紧凑性

Method: 包含三个模块：1）多视图实例学习模块通过重构自编码器和对比学习对齐一致信息并保留私有特征；2）特征和簇的双级解耦增强特征空间和簇空间的区分性；3）一致性学习模块将样本的不同视图及其邻居视为正对，学习聚类分配的一致性并压缩簇内空间

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有优越性

Conclusion: BDCL框架通过创新的双级解耦和一致性学习机制，有效提升了多视图聚类的性能，为多视图数据分析提供了更有效的表示学习方法

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于强化学习的自适应曝光组合优化方法，通过模拟运动模糊和噪声来提升动态场景中的HDR重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR技术忽视了快门速度与ISO的复杂交互作用，且没有考虑动态场景中的运动模糊效果，影响了HDR成像质量

Method: 提出AdaptiveAE方法，使用强化学习优化快门速度和ISO组合选择，集成了包含运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流程，利用语义信息和曝光直方图

Result: 在多个数据集上达到了最先进的性能，能够根据用户定义的曝光时间预算自适应选择最优ISO和快门速度序列

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE能够在动态环境中有效提升HDR重建质量，找到比传统方案更好的曝光策略

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 通过转移单打训练模型和对比学习框架，将姿态基于投出识别扩展到羽毛球双打比赛分析，解决了多人跟踪和动作识别挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 羽毛球双打比赛在国际赛事中更为普遍，但以前研究主要集中单打，因数据获取和多人跟踪存在挑战

Method: 使用ViT-Pose提取关键点，通过ST-GCN基础的对比学习框架进行嵌入，集成自定义多目标跟踪算法解决ID切换问题，最后用Transformer分类器识别投扣动作

Result: 证明了姿态基于投扣识别在双打羽毛球中的可行性，扩展了分析能力

Conclusion: 为双打特定数据集建立了基础，有助于深入理解这种主流但缺乏研究的羽毛球比赛形式

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGQ是一种新的图像标记化框架，通过整合2D高斯分布来增强结构建模，解决了传统VQ-GAN等方法在几何结构编码方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于量化的标记化方法（如VQ-GAN）主要关注纹理和颜色等外观特征，往往忽略几何结构，因为其基于patch的设计。需要开发能够更好编码结构化视觉信息的标记器。

Method: 提出视觉高斯量化（VGQ）框架，将图像潜在表示编码为2D高斯分布，直接建模位置、旋转和尺度等结构相关参数，通过增加2D高斯密度来提高重建保真度。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中，VGQ实现了rFID 1.00的重建质量。通过增加2D高斯密度，进一步达到rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93的SOTA性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ通过整合2D高斯分布有效增强了结构建模能力，在重建质量和视觉丰富度之间提供了灵活的权衡，为图像生成任务提供了更强大的标记化解决方案。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Motivation: 深度学习中观测训练样本与真实分布之间存在差距，这可能由采样偏差、噪声等因素导致。基础模型时代为解决这一问题提供了新机遇

Method: 利用现成的视觉基础模型（如CLIP、DINOv2）进行特征提取，发现特征分布的几何形状具有跨领域可转移性。构建几何知识指导的分布检验框架，在联邦学习中通过获取全局几何形状并生成新样本，在长尾分类中利用样本丰富类别的几何知识恢复尾部类别的真实分布

Result: 综合实验表明，几何知识指导的分布检验框架能够有效克服数据异质性和样本不平衡导致的信息缺失问题，在多个标准数据集上实现了性能提升

Conclusion: 基础模型的特征分布几何形状具有重要的跨领域可转移性，通过几何知识指导的分布检验可以有效地解决实际应用中的数据分布问题，为深度学习模型提供更准确的分布估计

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

Motivation: 现有的3DGS基于方法在捕捉细细层面部表情和保持局部纹理连续性方面面临挑战，特别是在高度可变形区域。

Method: 提出稀疏表情控制机制，用少量关键高斯控制周围高斯的变形；利用预训练生成模型的高质量3D先验知识提供面部几何结构指导。

Result: 方法能够生成更准确、视觉一致的头部重建结果，表现出更好的表情可控性和细节保真度。

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过表情感知和变形感知的设计，有效提升了3DGS基于头部虚拟人重建的质量和性能。

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

TL;DR: FLAIR提出了一种频率和局部性感知的隐式神经表示方法，通过RC-GAUSS激活函数和WEGE编码机制解决了现有INRs缺乏频率选择性和空间局部性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示(INRs)缺乏频率选择性、空间局部性和稀疏表示，导致过度依赖冗余信号分量，出现频谱偏差问题，难以捕捉高频细节。

Method: 提出了FLAIR方法，包含两个关键创新：1) RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间定位；2) WEGE编码，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数，显式引导频率信息到网络中。

Result: 该方法在2D图像表示和恢复以及3D重建任务中持续优于现有INRs。

Conclusion: FLAIR通过引入频率选择和空间定位机制，有效解决了INRs的频谱偏差问题，提升了高频细节的捕捉能力。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: 纯软件注视预测可以用于VR注视点渲染，使得性能提升能够更广泛地应用于不同的VR平台和应用，无需额外硬件要求

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

Conclusion: 该方法有望在资源受限环境（如移动边缘设备）中实现高效的GFVC部署

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Conclusion: 这种生物启发的方法具有很强的发展潜力，有助于克服当前神经形态计算的限制，促进SNN的更广泛应用

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中的跨类别泛化能力严重依赖于已知异常样本的先验知识，需要寻找无需重新训练即可检测未见类别异常的方法。

Method: 包含三个核心组件：字典构建（使用正常参考图像特征模拟字典索引和内容）、字典查找（通过稀疏查找策略检索查询特征，无法检索的特征被分类为异常）、查询判别正则化（通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力）。

Result: 在七个公共工业和医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，DictAS始终优于最先进的少样本异常分割方法。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了对未见对象类别的异常检测，无需重新训练，仅需少量正常参考图像，展现了优异的泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify建立了一个实用且简单的基线，在保持精度的同时大幅提升速度，具有良好的泛化能力和模型无关性。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and

generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Generative-Feature-Model/GAF.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种时序条件引用视频对象分割模型，通过改进分割头设计、利用文本到视频滿散模型提取特征，以及新的时序上下文掩码精细模块，在四个公开数据集上达到最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的RVOS方法过度关注特征提取和时序模型，而对分割头设计关注不够，分割头设计仍有很大改进空间。

Method: 1）集成现有分割方法提升边界分割能力 2）利用文本到视频滿散模型进行特征提取，移除传统噪声预测模块 3）设计时序上下文掩码精细(TCMR)模块充分利用VAE的特征提取能力

Result: 在四个公开RVOS测试集上均达到了state-of-the-art的性能水平

Conclusion: 通过重新关注分割头设计、利用滿散模型特征提取以及新的TCMR模块，本文方法能够在保持模型简洁的同时显著提升引用视频对象分割的质量。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的域适应流水线，通过将晴朗天气图像转换为雾、雨、雪和夜间图像来解决自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境下性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境条件下（如低光照和降水）表现显著下降，而现有数据集对恶劣条件的代表性不足，获取和标注恶劣天气数据的成本过高。

Method: 开发了多种数据生成流水线，包括纯模拟、基于GAN的方法以及混合扩散-GAN方法，利用现有DA GAN并扩展支持辅助输入，结合模拟和真实图像进行训练，并引入自适应混合方法来减少Stable-Diffusion输出的幻觉和伪影。

Conclusion: 提出的混合域适应方法能够有效生成逼真的恶劣天气图像，显著提升自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境下的感知性能，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaMe是一个专门为基于状态空间模型(SSM)的视觉模型设计的token合并策略，通过利用状态转移参数Δ来量化token重要性并保持序列特性，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在计算机视觉中表现出强大能力，但计算效率仍是实际部署的关键挑战。现有的token缩减方法需要针对SSM的序列建模特性进行专门设计。

Method: 提出MaMe策略：1) 使用状态转移参数Δ作为信息重要性度量；2) 引入战略性token排列来保持序列信息流；3) 针对SSM的独特序列建模能力进行优化。

Result: 实验表明MaMe在效率和性能之间达到优异平衡，即使在激进的token缩减下也能保持鲁棒性，在图像分类、视频和音频领域都展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaMe为SSM模型提供了一种有效的效率提升方法，在多个视觉和序列任务中表现出色，为SSM的实用化部署提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

Motivation: 现有方法使用耦合编码器来处理语义和几何前知，这引起了矛盾的需求和限制了整体性能。

Method: 提出双解耦设计：在源头级别使用基础编码器提供语义特征和立体成本体积，在途径级别通过专门化的解耦途径进行精炼。使用混合视图变换和新的轴向意识融合模块来生成统一表征。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI上超越之前最佳绩效+0.23 mIoU和+2.03 IoU，在SSCBench-KITTI-360上达到状态前沿性能21.78 mIoU和48.61 IoU。

Conclusion: FoundationSSC通过双解耦设计有效解决了语义和几何前知的矛盾，实现了两者性能的同时提升，为81a驾驶和机器人导航提供了更好的密集感知能力。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Conclusion: 该方法为仅使用RGB图像进行类别级物体姿势估计提供了新的研究视角，具有强大的应用潜力

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Conclusion: DiffIER是一个有效的即插即用优化框架，能够显著减少训练-推理差距，提高扩散模型的生成质量，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Conclusion: OmniTry成功扩展了虚拟试穿的应用范围，解决了多品类可穿戴物品试穿的数据挑战，具有更好的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: DeH4R成功解决了道路网络提取中的拓扑保真度和计算效率之间的权衡问题，为遥感图像中的道路网络图提取提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast

TL;DR: HumanPCR是一个评估多模态大模型在人类相关视觉上下文理解能力的三层次评估套件，包含感知、理解和推理三个层级，包含6000+人工验证的选择题和视频推理测试，发现现有模型在人类中心视觉理解方面存在显著挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态模型的快速发展，追求人工通用智能需要模型在多样化环境中达到人类可比的性能，但目前缺乏针对人类相关视觉上下文理解的系统性评估基准

Method: 提出HumanPCR评估套件，包含三个层次：Human-P（感知）、Human-C（理解）和Human-R（推理）。前两个层级包含6000+人工验证的多选题，评估9个维度的任务；Human-R提供手动策划的视频推理测试，需要整合多个视觉证据并主动提取上下文

Result: 对30多个最先进模型的评估显示，在人类中心视觉理解方面存在显著挑战，特别是在详细空间感知、时间理解和心智建模任务中。模型在从多样化人类场景中提取主动视觉证据方面表现困难，过度依赖查询引导检索

Conclusion: HumanPCR评估套件和发现将推动多模态模型的开发、评估和以人为中心的应用，即使采用先进的视觉上下文扩展和测试时思考技术也只能带来有限改进

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

TL;DR: 基于Mamba状态空间模型的半监督医学图像分割框架DCMamba，通过数据、网络和特征多角度增强多样性，显著提升了分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割的高质量标注数据获取成本高、耗时长，需要利用半监督学习技术来减轻标注负担。Mamba模型在长程依赖关系处理方面显示了高效能，但在医学图像分割领域的潜力仍有待挖掘

Method: 提出DCMamba框架，从三个角度增强多样性：1)数据层面-基于Mamba扫描特性的片层弱强混合增布；2)网络层面-多重扫描方向协作模块，利用不同扫描方向的预测差异；3)特征层面-不确定性加权对比学习机制增强特征表示多样性

Result: 在Synapse数据集上使用20%标记数据时，正式超过最新的SSM基础方法5.69%，显著优于其他半监督医学图像分割方法

Conclusion: DCMamba框架通过多角度增强多样性，充分发挥了Mamba模型在半监督医学图像分割中的潜力，为解决医学图像标注数据缺乏问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教育内容涉及农业和园艺等多个领域，通过Metaverse组织和丰富这些内容可以提升学习效果。然而，搜索相关虚拟场景并找到符合用户兴趣的内容仍然是个挑战，现有数据集过小且不足以训练高级模型。

Method: 研究提出了一种层次视觉-语言模型，用于表征和检索相关的农业虚拟博物馆(AgriMuseums)。方法使用自然语言查询来进行检索。

Result: 在实验设置中，提出的方法达到了约62%的R@1和78%的MRR，证明了其有效性。同时在现有基准上完成了最多6%的R@1和11%的MRR提升。

Conclusion: 这项研究为农业Metaverse内容检索提供了一个有效的解决方案，通过新的数据集和层次模型设计，显著提升了检索性能。代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

*Yiming Cao,Yanjie Li,Kaisheng Liang,Yuni Lai,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的中间投影器导向攻击方法(IPGA)，通过改变视觉-语言模型中的投影器模块来实现更精细的对抗性攻击，充分利用了Q-Former转换全局图像嵌入为细粒度视觉特征的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗性攻击方法通常在编码器层面使用全局相似性进行图像扰动，这导致丰富的视觉语义冲击成单一全局向量，限制了攻击细度和效果。同时忽视了投影器模块这个视觉-语言对齐管道中的关键语义桥梁。

Method: 提出IPGA方法，首次利用投影器模块(Q-Former)的中间阶段进行攻击，这个模块将全局图像嵌入转换为细粒度视觉特征。还提出殊余查询对齐(RQA)技术来保持无关的视觉内容。

Result: 实验结果显示IPGA在标准全局图像描述任务和细粒度视觉问答任务中都较现有方法更优。该方法还成功转移到多个商业VLM中，包括Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT。

Conclusion: IPGA通过利用投影器模块的中间表征，实现了更精确和可控的对抗性操纳，为视觉-语言模型的安全漏洞识别提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码图像来缓解多图像输入时的信息泄漏问题，显著提升多图像推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现良好，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互干扰，出现跨图像信息泄漏现象

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：1）顺序用随机噪声掩码除一张图像外的所有图像；2）获取部分掩码上下文下的logits；3）聚合logits并使用纯噪声参考输入进行对比精炼，抑制信息泄漏

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中一致提升性能，证明其通用性和实用性

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种无需额外训练或架构修改的通用实用解决方案，可有效增强多图像推理能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D位姿估计数据集主要针对机器人臂操作的小型家居对象，无法满足移动机器人平台的需求。移动机器人需要处理更大的对象、远距离感知、严重自遮挡和多样化视角等挑战。

Method: 创建MR6D数据集，包含92个真实工业场景，16个独特对象，涵盖静态和动态交互。数据集特别关注移动平台特有的挑战：远距离视角、多样化对象配置、大尺寸对象和复杂遮挡模式。

Result: 初步实验显示，当前6D位姿估计流程在这些设置下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个技术瓶颈。数据集为移动机器人位姿估计方法的开发和评估提供了基础。

Conclusion: MR6D填补了移动机器人6D位姿估计领域的空白，为开发适应移动机器人需求的位姿估计方法提供了重要基准，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 将多相机信息结合到形状模板重建(SfT)中，可以扩展医学成像和手持相机注册等应用场景，利用多视图相互约束提升重建准确性。

Method: 提出三种方法：1)关键点位于知道3D点的方向向量上；2)关键点位于未知但方向知道的3D点向量上；3)结合边缘信息的方法。使用凸优化和迭代精炼技术。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上验证了方法的准确性，成为普通相机SfT问题的首批解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为多相机3D形状注册提供了有效解决方案，通过利用多视角约束显著提升了重建质量，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP

Motivation: 现有方法在从视觉观察推断物体内在动力学时面临两大挑战：依赖手动定义的本构先验难以泛化到复杂场景，或使用神经网络导致可解释性差和泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出双层优化框架：上层使用LLM作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律，采用解耦机制降低搜索复杂度；下层通过视觉模拟评估生成定律与内在动力学的一致性来指导上层演化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw能有效从视觉观察推断可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有最先进方法，并在新场景的交互模拟中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: VisionLaw通过结合LLM的物理知识和视觉模拟验证，成功解决了内在动力学推断的可解释性和泛化性问题，为物理仿真提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估MLLM模型在图片旋转识别任务中的视觉理解能力，这需要检测旋转线索和理解空间关系的稳健视觉推理能力

Method: 构建RotBench标准化测试集（350张图片），测试多个独立和商业MLLM模型，使用辅助信息、链式推理、多方位显示等方法来改善性能

Result: 模型能识别0度图片，某些能识别180度，但无法区分90度和270度旋转；辅助信息和细调不能有效改善性能

Conclusion: MLLM模型在空间理解能力上与人类存在显著差距，尤其缺乏旋转方向的精细识别能力

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Conclusion: DetailGen3D在保持效率的同时成功实现了高质量的几何细节增强，为3D生成领域提供了有效的细节补充解决方案。

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

Method: 无监督聚类框架，结合街道级图像的视觉嵌入和空间植树模式，无需标签数据即可估算生物多样性

Result: 在八个北美城市应用时，该方法高保真度恢复属级多样性模式，Shannon和Simpson指数的Wasserstein距离低，保持了空间自相关性

Conclusion: 该可扩展、细粒度方法能够在缺乏详细量丰的城市进行生物多样性映射，为持续、低成本监测提供途径，支持绿化访问公平性和城市生态系统的适应性管理

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show

TL;DR: 通过学习高成功率分布来提升文本到图像生成的准确性，避免缺失关键元素或概念混淆的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的文本到图像模型在视觉效果上表现优异，但经常无法精确对齐文本提示，导致缺失关键元素或概念的意外混合

Method: 学习一个基于目标提示的高成功率分布，在去噪过程中显式建模信号组件，提供细粒度控制以减轻过度优化和分布外产物

Result: 方法在广泛实验中超越了当前最先进的方法，能够生成更准确反映提示内容的图像

Conclusion: 该方法为文本到图像生成提供了一种无需训练、可无缝集成的解决方案，支持多种条件模态并提升了空间对齐能力

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The
code is available at https://github.com/grimalPaul/gsn-factory.

TL;DR: RED.AI项目开发的Id-Pattern系统是一个多智能体AI系统，用于协助识别石材劣化模式，相比传统专家观察方法更高效且准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于专家团队直接观察的石材劣化识别方法虽然准确，但耗时耗力成本高昂，需要更高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用基于认知架构的多智能体AI系统，协调五个专业AI代理（岩相学家、病理学家、环境专家、保护修复师和诊断协调员）协作诊断石材病理。

Result: 在28张包含多种劣化模式的困难图像测试中，系统在所有指标上都相比基础模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: 多智能体AI系统能够有效模拟专家协作，自动化石材病理诊断，为文化遗产保护提供高效的技术支持。

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两个现实增量目标检测基准RICO，揭示了现有增量学习方法在适应性和知识保留方面的不足，发现重放少量旧数据优于所有方法，但独立训练仍是最佳方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增量学习评估多基于简化的合成基准，无法反映真实世界性能。需要构建包含领域偏移和类别扩展的现实基准来准确评估增量学习方法。

Method: 构建了两个基准：D-RICO（固定类别但领域偏移）和EC-RICO（每步增加新领域和类别）。基于14个多样化数据集，涵盖真实和合成领域、不同条件、相机传感器和标注策略。

Result: 所有增量学习方法在适应性和知识保留方面表现不佳，重放少量旧数据已优于所有方法，但独立训练效果最好。性能差距归因于蒸馏中的弱教师、单模型无法处理多样化任务以及可塑性不足。

Conclusion: 现有增量学习方法在现实场景中存在显著局限性，需要开发更有效的方法来处理真实世界中的复杂变化和挑战。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCRReg是一种新的正则化方法，利用潜在概念表示(LCRs)来引导医学影像深度学习模型学习语义基础表示，提高对分布偏移的鲁棒性，无需主训练集中的概念标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像深度学习模型往往在分布内表现良好，但在分布偏移下泛化能力差，容易依赖虚假相关性而非临床有意义的特征。

Method: 使用小型辅助数据集合成高质量、解耦的概念示例，提取预定义相关特征的LCRs，并通过正则化项引导CNN在相关概念潜在子空间内激活。

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中验证有效：在受控数据集上显著提高对注入虚假相关性的鲁棒性；在糖尿病视网膜病变分类任务中提升合成扰动和OOD泛化性能。

Conclusion: LCRReg提供了一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，无需密集概念监督即可提高模型鲁棒性，优于多任务学习、线性探测和后处理概念模型等基线方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

TL;DR: 单元素水平预测模型，使用Sentinel-5P数据和ConvLSTM网络，在南亚霾霉预测中获得良好结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南亚地区年度霾霉事件严重影响生态和经济，但缺乏有效的实时预测系统，需要开发准确的气洞污染物预测模型

Method: 采用Sentinel-5P卫星数据(2019-2023)，构建卷积长短期记忆网络(ConvLSTM)模型，以紫外线单元素指数(340-380nm)作为预测因子

Result: 模型能够在5天间隔下预测单元素指数，平均方差错误为~0.0018，损失值~0.3995，结构相似性指数~0.74

Conclusion: ConvLSTM模型在南亚霾霉预测中表现良好，但仍有提升空间，需要整合更多数据源和优化模型结构来提高预测精度

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Motivation: 现有的CNN方法忽视长程依赖关系，而Transformer方法可能忽略局部上下文信息，需要一种能同时处理这两者的方法来提升医学超声图像分割的性能。

Method: 设计了特征聚合模块(FAM)和卷积与交叉注意并行模块(CCAPM)，通过并行分支处理不同特征。将SCRM模块集成到UNet编码器中，构建了SCRNet框架。

Conclusion: 所提出的SCRNet框架通过有效结合卷积和交叉注意力机制，成功地同时抓取了长程依赖和局部上下文信息，为医学超声图像分割领域提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Motivation: 现有基于物理的3D运动合成方法依赖预重建的3D高斯表示，物理集成要么使用不灵活的手工定义物理属性，要么依赖不稳定、优化密集的视频模型指导。

Method: 首先联合优化高斯重建和概率物理预测建立基础模型，然后使用物理合理的参考视频进行精炼，采用直接偏好优化(DPO)使模拟与参考视频对齐，避免通过复杂可微分模拟和光栅化进行梯度反向传播。

Result: 方法能够从单图像在一分钟内生成高保真4D模拟，相比先前工作实现了显著加速，同时提供逼真的渲染结果。

Conclusion: PhysGM通过联合学习3D表示和物理属性，克服了现有方法的局限性，为单图像到4D物理模拟提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

TL;DR: DIME-Net是一个双光照增强框架，通过混合专家机制自适应处理低光和背光图像，无需重新训练即可在多种光照条件下实现竞争性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中复杂光照条件（如低光和背光）导致的图像退化严重影响图像质量和下游视觉任务，现有方法大多只针对单一类型的光照退化，缺乏统一处理多样化光照条件的能力

Method: 提出混合专家光照估计模块，使用稀疏门控机制根据输入图像的光照特性自适应选择合适的S曲线专家网络；结合Retinex理论设计损伤修复模块，配备光照感知交叉注意力和序列状态全局注意力机制；构建混合光照数据集MixBL

Result: 在合成和真实世界的低光和背光数据集上均取得竞争性性能，无需任何重新训练

Conclusion: DIME-Net展示了在多样复杂光照条件下的泛化能力和实际多媒体应用潜力

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

Motivation: 当前FIQA方法主要依赖CNN，而Vision Transformer架构在面部图像质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索

Method: 扩展标准ViT骨干网络，添加可学习的质量token与图像patch token拼接，通过全局自注意力处理，使用双头输出结构分别进行面部识别和质量分数回归

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试和不同FR模型上，ViT-FIQA始终达到顶级性能

Conclusion: 基于transformer的架构在建模面部图像效用方面非常有效，ViT有潜力作为未来FIQA研究的可扩展基础

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: The design and analysis of pallet setups are essential for ensuring safety of
packages transportation. With rising demands in the logistics sector, the
development of automated systems utilizing advanced technologies has become
increasingly crucial. Moreover, the widespread use of plastic wrapping has
motivated researchers to investigate eco-friendly alternatives that still

physical simulation system capable of replicating the behavior of moving
pallets. It features a 3D graphics-based virtual environment that supports a
wide range of configurations, including variable package layouts, different

reduces the need for physical testing, cutting costs and environmental impact
while improving measurement accuracy for analyzing pallet dynamics.
Additionally, we train a deep neural network to evaluate the rendered videos
generated by our simulator, as a crash-test predictor for pallet
configurations, further enhancing the system's utility in safety analysis.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅使用关键帧进行3D场景估计，无法完整捕捉整个场景，而在线处理又限制了可使用的帧数和训练迭代次数

Method: 提出适应性视角选择策略，在线分析重建质量并选择最优非关键帧进行额外训练，结合关键帧和选择的非关键帧，从多角度精炼不完整区域，还集成了在线多视角立体方法确保3D信息一致性

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在复杂户外场景中表现出艾出性能，超越了现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 通过适应性视角选择策略，成功实现了高质量的在线3D高斯涂射模型生成，显著提升了场景重建的完整性

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

TL;DR: 提出Noisy Alignment方法，通过显式抑制中毒图像中的噪声成分来增强数据投毒后门攻击的效果，在保持干净数据准确性的同时实现最先进的攻击性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据投毒对比学习后门攻击方法效果有限，主要依赖脆弱的隐式共现关系，且对中毒图像中判别性特征的抑制不足。

Method: 通过策略性操纵对比学习的随机裁剪机制，将噪声对齐过程建模为图像布局优化问题，并基于理论推导的最优参数实现。

Result: 方法简单有效，在保持干净数据准确性的同时，相比现有方法达到最先进的攻击性能，并对常见后门防御具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment通过显式噪声抑制机制有效解决了现有数据投毒对比学习后门攻击的局限性，为相关安全研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种能够处理无限长度序列的视频录音系统，为音频驱动的全身人物动画提供了有效解决方案，在保持识别和标志性动作的同时实现了高质量的动作同步。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术在新视角合成中效果显著，但需要大量高斯分布导致内存和存储消耗巨大，需要解决这一效率问题

Method: 使用多种教师模型（原始3DGS、噪声增强变体和dropout正则化版本）输出聚合来指导轻量学生模型优化，并提出结构相似性损失来保持几何结构一致性

Result: 在多个数据集上的综合评估显示，该方法在渲染质量和存储效率方面都达到了先进水平

Conclusion: Distilled-3DGS是一个简单有效的框架，无需复杂设计就能实现高质量的渲染效果和优异的存储效率

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和模型能够有效利用详细的视频描述和密集修改文本，在组合视频检索任务上表现出色，为细粒度视频理解提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense

ensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging
learned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that
converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiFo-Prompt是一个基于LLM的自动启发式设计框架，通过前瞻性和后顾性两种提示策略协同工作，显著提升了进化计算中启发式设计的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的自动启发式设计方法存在静态操作符和缺乏知识积累机制的问题，限制了其有效性。

Method: 提出HiFo-Prompt框架，包含两种提示策略：前瞻性提示基于种群动态自适应引导搜索，管理探索-利用权衡；后顾性提示从过去世代的成功启发式中提炼可重用的设计原则，构建持久知识库。

Result: 实验结果表明HiFo-Prompt显著优于最先进的基于LLM的AHD方法，生成更高质量的启发式，同时实现更快的收敛速度和更优的查询效率。

Conclusion: HiFo-Prompt通过前瞻性和后顾性提示的双重机制，成功将瞬时发现转化为持久知识，使LLM能够从自身经验中学习，为自动启发式设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

Result: AFM模型在web agent和code agent多个测试集上都达到了新的最高性能水平

Conclusion: 该研究为机器人模型和机器人加强学习领域提供了坚实的基础，所有模型权重、代码和训练数据都开源

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

TL;DR: 提出Cognitive Workspace新范式，通过模拟人类外部记忆使用机制，超越传统RAG方法，实现主动记忆管理和任务驱动的上下文优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在上下文管理方面存在根本限制，虽然技术如Infini-attention和StreamingLLM实现了长上下文，但缺乏元认知意识和主动规划能力，无法真正实现认知扩展。

Method: 基于认知科学理论（Baddeley工作记忆模型、Clark扩展心智论、Hutchins分布式认知框架），提出三个核心创新：主动记忆管理、分层认知缓冲区和任务驱动的上下文优化。

Result: 实证验证显示Cognitive Workspace达到平均58.6%的记忆重用率（传统RAG为0%），净效率增益17-18%，统计显著性p < 0.001，Cohen's d > 23。

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace代表了从信息检索到真正认知增强的根本性转变，为LLM系统提供了首个主动记忆优越性的定量证据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

Motivation: 现有alpha挖掘评估方法存在局限性：回测计算密集且参数敏感，相关性指标只关注预测能力而忽略稳定性、鲁棒性、多样性等重要属性，且大多数模型闭源阻碍了领域发展。

Method: 提出AlphaEval框架，从五个互补维度评估alpha质量：预测能力、稳定性、市场扰动鲁棒性、金融逻辑性和多样性，提供统一且可并行化的评估方案。

Conclusion: AlphaEval解决了alpha挖掘领域的系统性评估挑战，所有实现和评估工具都已开源，促进了可重复性和社区参与，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and

ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is

Method: 在三个常用能力测试集（HLE、SimpleQA、GPQA）上进行实验，分析搜索代理的日志记录，检测HuggingFace平台上是否包含测试问题和答案，并通过阻塞HuggingFace进行对比实验。

Result: 约3%的测试问题在HuggingFace上可以直接找到带有标签的数据集，导致代理直接拷贝答案。阻塞HuggingFace后，受污染问题子集的准确率下降了15%，证明污染对评估结果有显著影响。

Conclusion: 提出了搜索时污染这一新型泄漏问题，建议采用更严格的测试数据管理和结果报告规范，以确保搜索基于LLM代理评估的可靠性。并公开实验日志以便审计。

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

### [95] [QuickMerge++: Fast Token Merging with Autoregressive Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13204)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuickMerge是一个轻量级token合并框架，通过注意力范数动态选择重要token，使用基于熵的预算估计器，并引入轻量级transformer先验来保持自回归兼容性，显著减少计算token数量同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型在语言、视觉和视频领域处理更大输入，token级别的计算成本成为主要瓶颈。现有token选择方法大多是静态的、特定模态的或不兼容自回归生成。

Method: 基于注意力范数动态选择重要token，使用熵基预算估计器确定token数量，引入轻量级transformer先验在合并后的token序列上进行训练以保持自回归兼容性。

Result: 在多模态领域评估显示，QuickMerge在计算精度权衡方面持续改进，显著减少token数量同时匹配甚至超越学习型tokenizer和固定patch基线的性能。

Conclusion: QuickMerge通过语义显著性估计、灵活token预算和自回归对齐的组合，实现了用更少token进行准确生成，解决了大规模生成模型的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

*Adamo Cerioli,Edward D. Lee,Vito D. P. Servedio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 棋牌中人工智能与人类在战略决策中存在明显差异，AI能维持更高水平的战略紧张状态更长时间，而人类因认知限制而选择限制游戏复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究战略决策中即时机会与长期目标的特性，通过棋牌模型对比人类和AI在维持战略紧张方面的差异

Method: 提出基于网络的棋子互动指标来量化棋局中的战略紧张程度，分析人与人、AI与AI对局的动态变化

Result: 竞争力最强的AI能在更长时间内维持更高水平的战略紧张，而人类则选择限制紧张和游戏复杂度；人类专业水几在1600和2300 Elo附近出现突变增长

Conclusion: AI和人类在处理战略紧张时采取不同策略，AI更能容忍长期攻防平衡的复杂局面，这可能体现了人类的认知限制和适应性策略，对复杂战略环境中的AI应用具有含义

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于记忆的个性化方法主要关注偏好对齐和简单问答，但现实世界中复杂任务需要对大量用户信息进行多跳推理，这对当前记忆方法提出了重大挑战。

Method: 明确定义多跳个性化推理任务，构建数据集和统一评估框架，实现各种显式和隐式记忆方法，提出结合两种范式的混合方法HybridMem。

Result: 通过综合实验从多个角度评估了不同记忆方法的性能，分析了它们的优缺点，证明了HybridMem方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 多跳个性化推理是一个重要的研究问题，混合记忆方法HybridMem能够有效解决现有记忆机制的局限性，为研究社区提供了有价值的数据集和框架。

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at

Motivation: 科学文献中大量材料数据被困在非结构化的图表中，阻碍了基于大语言模型的AI智能体进行自动化材料设计

Method: 提出DIVE多智能体工作流，系统读取科学文献中的图形元素并组织实验数据，专注于固态氢存储材料

Result: 相比多模态模型直接提取，DIVE显著提高了数据提取准确性和覆盖率，商业模型提升10-15%，开源模型提升超过30%；建立了包含4,000篇文献中30,000条数据的数据库，能够在两分钟内识别未报道的氢存储成分

Conclusion: DIVE工作流和智能体设计可广泛应用于不同材料，为AI驱动的材料发现提供了新范式

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

Conclusion: 该框架通过外部工具集成、适应性计划执行和多模态协作，有效提升了AI在心血管疾病临床应用中的性能和实用性

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOOP是一个新颖的神经符号规划框架，通过神经和符号组件之间的迭代对话来解决复杂规划问题，在标准基准测试中达到85.8%的成功率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经规划方法在复杂领域存在缺失前提条件、目标不一致和幻觉问题，而经典规划器缺乏灵活性和自然语言理解能力。现有神经符号方法采用一次性翻译方式，未能充分利用神经和符号组件的协同作用。

Method: LOOP将规划视为神经和符号组件之间的迭代对话，集成了13个协调的神经特征，包括图神经网络处理空间关系、多智能体验证、层次分解和因果记忆等，能够生成PDDL规范并根据符号反馈进行迭代优化。

Result: 在六个标准IPC基准域上的评估显示，LOOP达到85.8%的成功率，显著优于LLM+P（55.0%）、LLM-as-Planner（19.2%）和Tree-of-Thoughts（3.3%）等方法。

Conclusion: 可靠规划的关键不在于选择神经网络还是符号推理器，而在于让它们在整个过程真正"对话"。LOOP为构建可信赖的自主系统提供了全面蓝图。

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

TL;DR: SPANER是一个模态无关的参数高效微调框架，通过共享提示机制将不同模态的输入嵌入到统一的语义空间中，提升跨模态泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态参数高效微调方法主要关注任务特定性能提升，但忽略了多模态嵌入空间的结构，导致模态特定表示孤立，限制了跨模态泛化能力。

Method: 提出SPANER框架，采用共享提示机制作为概念锚点，使语义相关的实例在空间中收敛，无论其模态如何。该设计具有可扩展性，支持无缝集成额外模态。

Result: 在视觉-语言和音频-视觉基准测试中，SPANER展示了具有竞争力的少样本检索性能，同时在学习的嵌入空间中保持了高语义一致性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了对齐嵌入结构的重要性，而不仅仅是调整适配器权重，这对于可扩展的多模态学习至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实金融文档中的表格信息通常埋藏在混乱、多页、碎片化的表格中（99.4%的表格没有边界框），传统方法难以有效提取这些高度非结构化的金融持仓信息。

Method: 开发了TASER系统，包含表格检测、分类、提取和推荐代理，利用初始模式执行提取，然后通过推荐代理审查输出、建议模式修订并做出最终决策，实现持续学习。

Result: TASER比Table Transformer等现有表格检测模型性能提升10.1%；大批量处理使可操作的模式建议增加104.3%，提取持仓增加9.8；构建了包含22,584页、3,213个表格、7310亿美元持仓的真实金融表格数据集TASERTab。

Conclusion: 基于代理的模式引导提取系统在理解现实世界金融表格方面展现出巨大潜力，持续学习过程对提升提取效果至关重要。

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex temporal

and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world

Conclusion: DMMV作为通用优化问题形式具有重要价值，所提贫例算法在多个领域都取得显著成效，将开源以促进更多应用研究

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型代理在风险认知和安全执行之间存在显著差距，虽然能正确识别理论风险，但在实际执行中经常忽略风险并执行危险操作。作者开发了一个风险验证系统，通过抽象化执行轨迹来帮助模型更有效地识别风险，将危险操作执行率降低了55.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型代理在安全关键场景中存在严重风险，虽然理论上知道某些操作的危险性，但在实际执行时往往无法识别风险或直接执行危险操作，这种认知与执行的差距需要系统研究。

Method: 开发了一个全面的评估框架，从三个递进维度评估代理安全性：风险知识、风险识别能力和实际行为。基于发现的性能差距，构建了一个风险验证系统，包含独立批判代理提议动作的验证器，以及将具体执行轨迹转换为抽象描述的抽象器。

Result: 评估显示代理在风险知识方面表现近乎完美（>98%通过率），但在实际场景中识别风险时性能下降超过23%，执行危险操作时通过率低于26%。风险验证系统将危险操作执行率降低了55.3%。

Conclusion: 单纯扩展模型能力或推理计算并不能解决安全问题，需要在风险认知和执行之间建立更好的连接机制。通过抽象化执行轨迹和独立验证的方法可以有效提升语言模型代理的安全性。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

Conclusion: CrafterDojo成功地将Crafter环境转变为适合快速原型开发的Minecraft-like测试平台，为通用具身智能体研究提供了有效的工具支持。

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

TL;DR: EAG-RL是一个两阶段训练框架，通过专家注意力引导来增强大语言模型在电子健康记录推理方面的内在能力，平均提升14.62%的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗文本理解方面表现出色，但在基于电子健康记录的预测任务中表现不佳，因为难以处理时间结构化和高维数据。现有混合方法只是将LLM作为检索器，未能提升其内在推理能力

Method: 提出EAG-RL两阶段框架：1）使用专家引导的蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量逐步推理轨迹来初始化LLM策略；2）通过强化学习优化策略，将LLM注意力与专家模型识别的临床重要特征对齐

Result: 在两个真实世界EHR数据集上的实验显示，EAG-RL平均提升LLM内在EHR推理能力14.62%，同时增强了对特征扰动的鲁棒性和对未见临床领域的泛化能力

Conclusion: EAG-RL展示了在临床预测任务中实际部署的潜力，通过专家注意力引导有效提升了LLM的EHR推理能力

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been
available at https://github.com/devilran6/EAG-RL.

TL;DR: 本文提出了多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)方法，通过多粒度结构化奖励系统突破图表到代码生成任务中监督微调的性能瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习在视觉语言模型中表现优异，但在需要深入理解信息丰富图像并生成结构化输出的任务中应用不足。图表到代码生成任务需要复杂的视觉推理，仅靠监督微调往往不够，需要有效的强化学习策略来适当奖励结构化输出。

Method: 构建了包含300万图表-代码对的最大训练语料库，提出MSRL方法使用多粒度结构化奖励系统：文本层面使用基于规则的奖励验证代码细节，视觉层面通过渲染生成代码到图像并使用评估模型评估结构相似性。采用两阶段课程学习确保训练稳定性。

Result: MSRL显著突破了SFT的性能瓶颈，在ChartMimic和ReachQA基准测试上分别将高级指标提高了6.2%和9.9%，达到了与先进闭源模型竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 多模态结构化强化学习是解决图表到代码生成等需要复杂视觉推理和结构化输出任务的有效方法，能够突破监督微调的性能限制。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: V2P方法通过抑制注意力机制和基于Fitts定律的高斯热图建模，解决了GUI元素定位中的背景干扰和中心-边缘区分问题，在ScreenSpot基准上达到92.3%和50.5%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI定位方法忽视空间交互不确定性和视觉语义层次结构，现有注意力方法存在背景区域干扰导致注意力漂移，以及均匀标注无法区分目标UI元素中心与边缘导致点击不精确的问题。

Method: 提出Valley-to-Peak (V2P)方法：1) 抑制注意力机制最小化对无关区域的关注；2) 基于Fitts定律的2D高斯热图建模，权重从中心向边缘递减，方差由目标尺寸决定。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2和ScreenSpot-Pro两个基准测试上分别达到92.3%和50.5%的性能，消融实验验证了各组件贡献。

Conclusion: V2P方法能有效隔离目标区域并让模型专注于UI元素最关键的点，具有精确GUI定位任务的泛化能力。

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

Motivation: 现有知识图谱查询方法主要基于一阶逻辑，无法处理现实世界中普遍存在的模糊或上下文相关的软约束需求

Method: 提出神经查询重排序器(NQR)，通过增量学习用户提供的偏好和非偏好实体示例来调整查询得分，不破坏原始查询答案

Result: 实验表明NQR能够有效捕捉软约束，同时保持稳健的查询应答性能

Conclusion: 该方法填补了知识图谱查询中软约束处理的空白，为现实应用中更灵活的查询需求提供了解决方案

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Method: ITL-LIME引入实例迁移学习，从相关源域获取真实实例辅助目标域解释。通过聚类获取源域原型，检索相似源实例，结合目标实例邻域，使用对比学习编码器加权，训练代理模型。

Conclusion: ITL-LIME框架通过实例迁移学习有效解决了LIME在数据约束环境中的局限性，为黑盒模型提供了更可靠和稳定的局部解释方法。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

Method: 研究了情境知识图的特殊特征，对比了标准链接预测算法在这一领域的表现

Result: 发现很多链接预测算法不适合情境知识图，甚至无法超过简单的基准方法

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs are used for various purposes, including business

paper, we investigate knowledge graphs describing household actions, which are
beneficial for controlling household robots and analyzing video footage. In the
latter case, the information extracted from videos is notoriously incomplete,
and completing the knowledge graph for enhancing the situational picture is
essential. In this paper, we show that, while a standard link prediction
problem, situational knowledge graphs have special characteristics that render
many link prediction algorithms not fit for the job, and unable to outperform
even simple baselines.

Motivation: 第三方网站获取的简历往往不完整且不准确，需要通过重复检测来提高简历质量并丰富公司人才库，但简历文本的语义复杂性、结构异质性和信息不完整性使这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: 提出MHSNet框架，使用对比学习微调BGE-M3模型，通过状态感知的Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）生成多级稀疏和密集表示来计算多级语义相似度，处理各种不完整简历。

Result: 实验结果验证了MHSNet的有效性。

Conclusion: MHSNet能够有效解决简历重复检测中的挑战，提高第三方简历质量并丰富公司人才库。

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results across various
tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge.
Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a

with neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper
comprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for
enhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks
and give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we
discuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
from three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic.
Finally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions. We

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalPlan是一个两阶段框架，通过将显式结构因果推理集成到LLM规划过程中，解决了小型开源LLM代理在协作任务中产生因果无效或不连贯动作的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理（尤其是小型开源模型）在协作任务中往往产生因果无效或不连贯的动作，因为它们依赖表面相关性而非基于因果推理，这限制了它们在动态环境中的协调和规划性能。

Method: 提出CausalPlan框架，核心是结构因果行动（SCA）模型，从代理轨迹中学习因果图来捕捉先前行动和当前环境状态如何影响未来决策。该结构用于通过分配因果分数来指导行动选择，重新加权LLM生成的提议，或在需要时回退到基于因果的替代方案。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI基准测试中，使用四种不同规模的LLM（Gemma-7B、Llama-8B、Qwen-14B和Llama-70B）进行五个多代理协调任务的评估。实验结果显示CausalPlan一致减少了无效动作，在AI-AI和人类-AI设置中都改善了协作性能，优于强化学习基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了因果驱动规划对于部署高效、可解释和可泛化多代理LLM系统的价值，该方法不需要对LLM本身进行微调即可约束规划行为保持干预一致性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

Result: 在MMLU-Pro-Health数据集上达到74.45%准确率，比最佳闭源模型GPT-4-0613提升2.69%

Conclusion: EMRC框架通过专家感知的代理招募策略和代理互补性，有效利用了各LLM的专业能力，显著提升了医疗决策性能

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo

instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,

paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

Motivation: 当前单一RAG框架无法良好适应广泛的下游任务，需要抓取多个RAG系统的优势来提升性能。

Method: 从理论和机制两个角度分析RAG集成框架：理论上从信息熵角度解释，机制上从流程级和模块级分析，选择四种流程（分支、迭代、循环、代理）和三种模块（生成器、检索器、重排器）进行实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，无论是在流程级还是模块级，聚合多个RAG系统都显示出良好的通用性和稳健性。

Conclusion: 本研究为多RAG系统集成相关研究奠定了基础，证明了集成方法在提升RAG系统性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的方法只生成一个策略并直接生成程序，如果策略错误就会导致错误的广义计划，需要提高精度和可靠性

Method: 使用伪代码形式生成策略并自动调试，在Python调试阶段添加反思步骤，生成多个程序变体选择最佳方案

Result: 在17个基准领域中显著提高了广义计划质量，其12个领域的最佳Python程序能解决所有可生成的任务

Conclusion: 通过伪代码调试、反思步骤和多程序选择的综合方法能够有效提升LLM生成广义计划的成功率和质量

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

TL;DR: TS-Agent是一个模块化代理框架，用于自动化金融时间序列建模工作流，通过三阶段决策过程（模型选择、代码优化、微调）结合LLM推理能力，在金融预测任务中优于现有AutoML和代理基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融时间序列建模面临高性能、可解释性和可审计性的挑战，现有AutoML框架缺乏对领域特定需求和动态目标的适应性，而LLM代理系统提供了更灵活的工作流自动化路径。

Method: 提出TS-Agent框架，采用三阶段结构化迭代决策过程：模型选择、代码优化和微调，配备规划代理和结构化知识库，包含精选模型库和优化策略库，通过上下文推理和实验反馈指导探索。

Result: 在多样化金融预测和合成数据生成任务上的实证评估表明，TS-Agent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines，实现了更高的准确性、鲁棒性和决策可追溯性。

Conclusion: TS-Agent支持自适应学习、鲁棒调试和透明审计，满足了金融服务等高风险环境的关键需求，为时间序列建模提供了更灵活、可解释的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

TL;DR: AI驱动的供应链代理在理论上优越的协作设计下反而表现更差，出现"合作悖论"，通过分层策略（高层AI政策制定+低层协作执行）才能实现系统稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI代理在经济环境中的战略行为，特别是在多级供应链这种容易出现牛鞭效应等不稳定性的合作场景中的表现。

Method: 使用基于大语言模型的生成式AI代理在受控供应链模拟中进行计算实验，分析其行为倾向，并开发分层框架来解决问题。

Result: 发现"合作悖论"现象，即理论上更优的协作AI代理表现反而更差，原因是代理囤积库存导致系统资源枯竭。最终提出的分层框架能够自主生成、评估和量化可行的战略选择。

Conclusion: 揭示了协作AI代理的涌现行为特征，为设计稳定有效的AI驱动商业分析系统提供了蓝图，强调需要高层政策制定和低层协作执行相结合的分层策略。

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了如何通过精炼大语言模型（LLMs）来帮助专家使用PyChrono模拟工具，提高模拟脚本生成质量和降低学习门槛


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业模拟工具（如PyChrono）使用门槛高的问题，让LLMs能够成为虚拟助手帮助专家生成高质量模拟脚本

Method: 提出了一个框架，通过精炼和定制开源和闭源LLMs，使其能够生成PyChrono模拟脚本，范围从简单的单摆到复杂的车辆模拟

Result: 精炼后的LLMs在生成PyChrono模拟脚本质量方面取得了量化的改善，虽然脚本不完美但可作为良好起点，同时能回答API问题和推荐建模方法

Conclusion: 该框架具有普遍性，可以扩展到其他模拟工具领域，有效降低专业模拟工具的使用门槛

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large
language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become
virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用偏置随机化关键道因算法(BRKGA)解决最长连续子序列(LRS)问题，该算法在计算效率和解质量方面表现优异，但在大字母表字符串上仍有改进空间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRS问题是一个NP难组合优化问题，在生物信息学特别是基因组重新组装中发挥重要作用，需要高效算法来解决这个具有挑战性的问题

Method: 提出了一种基于偏置随机化关键道因算法(BRKGA)的方案，重点关注个体评估的计算效率，将灰度值向量转换为有效解。为了对比，还开发了最大-最小蚂蚁系统(MMAS)以及使用CPLEX整数规划求解器

Result: 计算结果显示，提出的BRKGA算法在LRS问题上达到了当前最先进的技术水平，在计算效率和解的质量方面都表现优异

Conclusion: BRKGA算法是解决LRS问题的有效方法，但在处理基于大字母表的输入字符串时，仍然存在改进空间，需要进一步优化

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,
demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop
automation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et
al., 2024a)

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种不确定性感知学习策略，通过同时学习医生的背景知识和肺部病变信息，提高医疗AI在胸部X光片诊断中的准确性和可信质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医生对医疗AI系统的不信任主要来自对其诊断不确定性的担忧。临床诊断中医生利用了广泛的背景知识和经验，而医疗AI仅依赖对目标病变的重复学习，导致知识缺乏和诊断不确定性。

Method: 提出不确定性感知学习策略，同时学习医生的背景知识和肺部病变信息。使用了来自Ajou大学医院的2,517张无病变图像和656张结节图像。

Result: 提案模型达到92%的性能（IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2），敏感度比基准模型提高10%，不确定性指标熬的相对熬降低0.2。

Conclusion: 通过学习医生的背景知识，可以有效解决医疗AI的知识缺乏问题，降低诊断不确定性，提高医生对AI系统的信任度，促进临床应用。

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.
