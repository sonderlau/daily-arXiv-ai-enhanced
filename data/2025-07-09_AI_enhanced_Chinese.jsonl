In practice, two-parameter spectra based on significant wave height and\nenergy period are ubiquitous. Two-parameter spectra have been shown\ninsufficient in capturing the range of spectral shapes that can occur in an\nactual ocean environment. Furthermore, through sensitivity analysis, these\ntwo-parameters have been shown to be insufficient for predicting power\nperformance of WECs. Four parameter spectra, which expand the parameter space\nto include two additional shape parameters have been shown sufficient in\ncapturing sea state variance, but their effect on mean power estimates has not\nbeen presented. This work directly looks at the effects of incorporating\n4-parameter spectra into annual power estimates compared to using the\ntraditional 2-parameter spectra. We use two different 4-parameter spectra: one\nfrom the literature and a novel machine learning-based autoencoder, presented\nhere. Both are shown to improve the information retained when parameterizing\nspectra. The site-specific autoencoder performs consistently the best across\ntwo case studies of mean annual power prediction, achieving an error around 1%\nin each instance. The 2-parameter spectra resulted in less consistent\npredictive performance, with errors of -8% and 1% in the two case studies. For\nthe case study where all three models performed well, it is shown that the low\nerror in the 2-parameter model is attributable to a symmetrical distribution of\nlarge errors whereas both 4-parameter spectra result in relatively low errors\nthroughout the parametric space. These results highlight the need for more\nsophisticated resource characterization methods for estimating the power\nperformance of WECs and suggest site-specific machine learning-based spectra\nare an adequate option.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f7f\u75282\u53c2\u6570\u548c4\u53c2\u6570\u6ce2\u8c31\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6ce2\u6d6a\u80fd\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff08WEC\uff09\u5e74\u5747\u529f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b04\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf2\u53c2\u6570\u6ce2\u8c31\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u5b9e\u9645\u6d77\u6d0b\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6ce2\u8c31\u5f62\u72b6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4WEC\u529f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf2\u53c2\u6570\u6ce2\u8c31\u4e0e\u4e24\u79cd4\u53c2\u6570\u6ce2\u8c31\uff08\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u5728\u5e74\u5747\u529f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "4\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea6\u4e3a1%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e2\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u8bef\u5dee-8%\u548c1%\uff09\u30024\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "4\u53c2\u6570\u6ce2\u8c31\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8WEC\u529f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To provide a computationally efficient alternative, we introduce\nHRRRCast, a data-driven emulator built with advanced machine learning\ntechniques. HRRRCast includes two architectures: a ResNet-based model (ResHRRR)\nand a Graph Neural Network-based model (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR uses convolutional\nneural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise\nLinear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising\nDiffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a\nsingle model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy\nrollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity\nover the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR\noutperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves\ncompetitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the\nStormCast model of Pathak et al. [21] by: a) training on the full CONUS domain,\nb) using multiple lead times to improve long-range skill, c) training on\nanalysis data instead of the +1h post-analysis data inadvertently used in\nStormCast, and d) incorporating future GFS states as inputs, enabling\ndownscaling that improves long-lead accuracy. Grid-, neighborhood-, and\nobject-based metrics confirm better storm placement, lower frequency bias, and\nhigher success ratios than HRRR. HRRRCast ensemble forecasts also maintain\nsharper spatial detail, with power spectra more closely matching HRRR analysis.\nWhile GraphHRRR underperforms in its current form, it lays groundwork for\nfuture graph-based forecasting.

Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces\n(BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing\napproach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes\nstate-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928\nimage editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography\n(EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography\n(PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address\nthe heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The\ncross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific\nfeatures. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these\nfeatures into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics\nvia fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train\nthe encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic\nintentions from embedded natural language.

An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22%\nfor small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies,\nrespectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based\non canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining\nreal time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide\napplication.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to\ntackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from\nthat, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are\ntypically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature\ntransitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared\nto those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose\nlearning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to\nconstruct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the\ninconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to\neffectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference.

This study\ncompares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a\nreasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.\n  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI\n(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The\nanonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human\nexperts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical\nrubric.\n  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored\npeer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;\np=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th\n(mean 6.97).

Existing works pay more attention to\nimproving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding\nspeed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing\nmethods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video\nrepresentation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds\nper frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose\nGSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS\nand 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.\nSpecifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of\nthe video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and\nthe polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object\nmotion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing\nstrategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)\nbased on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion\nand non-rigid movements.

After each\naction, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.\nHowever, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning\n(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is\nnon-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in\ncomplex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual\ntargets.\n  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI\nTest-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate\naction proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we\nsample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to\nevaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better\ndecision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and\nimproving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves\nimproved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its\ncorresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning\n(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,\nrewarding successful clicks on interface elements.\n  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across\ndiverse benchmarks.

Existing prompt-based and adapter-based\nworks have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the\nchallenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards\nunseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating\nall tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting\non less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and\ndegrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept\nrecognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a\nnovel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class\ngeneralization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the\nimportance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first\nemploys token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and\ngroup tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to\nthe importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature\nranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response\nmechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels\nidentified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1\nregularization term is introduced to stabilize the training.

These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide\ntext or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works\nignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within\nand between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new\nclasses remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an\nIntegrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of\ninformation representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces\nself-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural\nrelationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across\nmodalities.

Although\nvanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal\nmovement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over\nboth camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the\nunstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose\nLiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core\nprinciples: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we\nanalyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling\ndecoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced\nacross layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.\nThird, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)\nto linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a\nmodified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we\nextend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,\nunifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that\nLiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy\nand motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal\ntraining data.

Vision-based pose\nestimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling\nsolution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting\nconditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,\nblooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic\nor event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,\nevent sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced\nsignal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work\naddresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion\napproach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to\nachieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique\nwas developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to\nachieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The\npipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme\nconditions that affect either channel.

However, these\ndatasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving\nthe impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or\ndepth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate\nsuch variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nSenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,\n9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.\nFor three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire\n101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting\npermutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our\ndataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater\nperformance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance\ncomparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data\nquantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is\neffective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even\ngreater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from\ndata-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive,\nself-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain\nreal-world environments.

Although LSTM is widely used for time-series\nforecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains\nunderexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and\nProphet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM\nachieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)\nof 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE:\n87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm\nis applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies,\nenabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations.

Meanwhile, neural\nreconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense\nmulti-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we\nintroduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,\ninteractable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a\nthree-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D\nobject meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D\nsegmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video\ndiffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable\npart masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by\nocclusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by\na dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to\nensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts.

In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of\nindividually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each\nindividual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain\nthis phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points\nsuffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised\nfinetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled\nexperiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data\ngenerated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even\nsmaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard\n11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the\nperformance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base\nmodel while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta\nlearning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art\npost-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic\nregression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides\nuseful signal for improving a stronger student.

In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation\ngraph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual\ninformation, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate\nthat SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set\nscenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPADE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u566a\u7f51\u7edc\u6539\u8fdb\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47PSG\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u7cfb\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002", "method": "SPADE\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u6b65\uff1a(1) \u53cd\u6f14\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684UNet\u6821\u51c6\uff0c(2) \u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u5173\u7cfb\u56feTransformer\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728PSG\u548cVisual Genome\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSPADE\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "SPADE\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLMs\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3aPSG\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This task aims to achieve cross-domain mapping between\nmorphological structures and staining patterns through generative models,\nproviding an efficient and cost-effective solution for pathological analysis.\nHowever, under weakly paired conditions, spatial heterogeneity between adjacent\nslices presents significant challenges.

However, sensor synchronization challenges\noften compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where\nshortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains\nunderexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on\ntracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly,\nunder such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance\ndegradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to\neffectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose\na flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker\nshould dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates.\nThis is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion\nmechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy\nthat ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is\ncritical for effective video tracking.

Analogously, we\nfind limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same\nproblems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity\nmetrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent.

Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that\nrequire pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.\nHowever, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in\nlocalization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration\nand spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite\nimages, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of\ncity scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach\nemploys a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and\nthen extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as\nwell as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is\nperformed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using\nradial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied\nto the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve\nvertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI\nbenchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the\nKITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard\ndeviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a\n55.3\\% improvement over the original dataset.

This paper introduces\na new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware\nAttention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three\nwell-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder\nthat encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph\nrepresentations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input\ntext that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of\nthe character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to\nlimit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to\navoid distortion artifacts.

Previous methods\nrely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to\nmisalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene\ngeometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the\naccumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in\nblurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose\nRef-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D\nGaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected\ncomponents to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric\nconsistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch\nrepresentation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency\nreflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo\nreflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we\nincorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness\nconstraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms\nclassical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with\nNeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)\ndriven reflection editing.

On well-structured domains such as\nvector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential\ngeometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with\nstrong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a\ncarefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most\npractitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing\nlayers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain.

To address these issues, we propose\nRSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow\ninto a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine\nsegmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with\nSAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model\ncollaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to\nactivate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate\nlocalization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in\nmulti-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order\nprompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via\ndecomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These\noptimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level\nrefined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive\nexperiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2\nsurpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex\nsemantic interpretation.
