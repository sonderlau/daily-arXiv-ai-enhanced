TL;DR: 提出了一种结合结构和功能连接的多模态图神经网络框架，用于提升图分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实网络需要同时捕捉局部和全局交互，受脑成像中多模态分析的启发。

Result: 实验显示性能优于现有方法，验证了脑启发表示的有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态图神经网络框架在图分类任务中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Real-world networks often benefit from capturing both local and global
interactions. Inspired by multi-modal analysis in brain imaging, where
structural and functional connectivity offer complementary views of network
organization, we propose a graph neural network framework that generalizes this
approach to other domains. Our method introduces a functional connectivity
block based on persistent graph homology to capture global topological
features. Combined with structural information, this forms a multi-modal
architecture called Functional Connectivity Graph Neural Networks. Experiments
show consistent performance gains over existing methods, demonstrating the
value of brain-inspired representations for graph-level classification across
diverse networks.

### [2] [Identity Increases Stability in Neural Cellular Automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06389)
*James Stovold*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 通过引入带有简单约束的'identity'层，提高了神经细胞自动机（NCA）生成的二维人工生物的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NCA生成的生物在边界稳定性和形状保持上的问题，避免肿瘤样生长或形状崩溃。

Method: 在训练过程中引入一个带有简单约束的'identity'层。

Result: 改进后的NCA模型在生物近距离生长时更稳定，且仅需单一身份值即可实现稳定性提升。还观察到稳定生物出现运动行为。

Conclusion: 为研究NCA生成生物间的互动奠定了基础，有助于探索人工生物在细胞层面的社会行为。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) offer a way to study the growth of
two-dimensional artificial organisms from a single seed cell. From the outset,
NCA-grown organisms have had issues with stability, their natural boundary
often breaking down and exhibiting tumour-like growth or failing to maintain
the expected shape. In this paper, we present a method for improving the
stability of NCA-grown organisms by introducing an 'identity' layer with simple
constraints during training.
  Results show that NCAs grown in close proximity are more stable compared with
the original NCA model. Moreover, only a single identity value is required to
achieve this increase in stability. We observe emergent movement from the
stable organisms, with increasing prevalence for models with multiple identity
values.
  This work lays the foundation for further study of the interaction between
NCA-grown organisms, paving the way for studying social interaction at a
cellular level in artificial organisms.

### [3] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Residual Perturbation Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05689)
*Jinjia Peng,Zeze Tao,Huibing Wang,Meng Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ResPA的新型攻击方法，通过残差梯度作为扰动方向，提升对抗样本的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迁移攻击方法忽略了扰动方向的影响，导致迁移性受限。

Method: ResPA利用残差梯度作为扰动方向，结合历史梯度方向，引导对抗样本朝向损失函数的平坦区域。

Result: 实验表明，ResPA的迁移性优于现有方法，且与输入变换方法结合可进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: ResPA通过全局扰动方向优化，显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering
from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based
attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these
examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that
adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability
to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook
the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.
In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation
Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction
to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.
Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input
gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which
encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying
on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation
direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient
and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation
direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of
ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the
transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current
input transformation methods. The code is available at
https://github.com/ZezeTao/ResPA.

### [4] [Learning Representations of Satellite Images with Evaluations on Synoptic Weather Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06122)
*Ting-Shuo Yo,Shih-Hao Su,Chien-Ming Wu,Wei-Ting Chen,Jung-Lien Chu,Chiao-Wei Chang,Hung-Chi Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了PCA、CAE和预训练残差网络在卫星图像表示学习中的表现，发现CAE在分类任务中表现最佳，但缺乏物理可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同表示学习算法在卫星图像天气事件分类中的效果，并评估其潜在空间的性能。

Method: 使用PCA、CAE和预训练残差网络（PT）对卫星图像进行表示学习，并通过分类任务评估潜在空间。

Result: CAE在所有分类任务中表现最佳；PCA命中率高但误报率也高；PT在热带气旋识别中表现优异但在其他任务中较差。高分辨率数据集对深度学习算法更有利。

Conclusion: CAE高效有效，但缺乏物理可解释性，未来可开发物理信息版本的CAE。

Abstract: This study applied representation learning algorithms to satellite images and
evaluated the learned latent spaces with classifications of various weather
events. The algorithms investigated include the classical linear
transformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep
learning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network
pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated
that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores
for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit
rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed
exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other
tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from
higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for
deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent
space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a
latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false
alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently,
the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to
physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE
can be a promising outlook for the current work.

### [5] [Generalized Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05732)
*Pinxuan Li,Bing Cao,Changqing Zhang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种广义少样本OOD检测框架（GOOD），通过引入通用知识模型（GKM）和知识动态嵌入（KDE）机制，提升模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本OOD检测方法在开放世界中的泛化能力不足，容易过拟合，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出GOOD框架，利用GKM增强通用知识，并通过KDE机制动态调整通用知识对检测模型的指导。

Result: 在真实OOD基准测试中表现优越，理论证明了GS平衡能降低泛化误差上界。

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过通用知识与动态嵌入机制，显著提升了少样本OOD检测的泛化性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a critical
research direction in machine learning for practical deployment. Most existing
Few-shot OOD detection methods suffer from insufficient generalization
capability for the open world. Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD
detection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus
degrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently
across different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a
Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general
knowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model
(GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal
the few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically
derive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which
provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general
knowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)
mechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE
dynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the
general knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM,
thereby boosting the GS-balance. Experiments on real-world OOD benchmarks
demonstrate our superiority. Codes will be available.

### [6] [UnGuide: Learning to Forget with LoRA-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05755)
*Agnieszka Polowczyk,Alicja Polowczyk,Dawid Malarz,Artur Kasymov,Marcin Mazur,Jacek Tabor,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnGuide是一种新方法，通过动态推理机制UnGuidance，结合LoRA适配器，实现对扩散模型中特定知识的精确去除，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像扩散模型的潜在滥用风险（如生成有害或误导性内容）促使需要有效的机器遗忘方法。

Method: UnGuide结合UnGuidance（基于Classifier-Free Guidance的动态推理机制）和LoRA适配器，通过调整引导尺度实现选择性遗忘。

Result: UnGuide在概念去除任务中表现优于现有方法，同时保持图像保真度和模型表达能力。

Conclusion: UnGuide为扩散模型中的精确知识去除提供了有效解决方案，平衡了遗忘与模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened
concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or
misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine
unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained
models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models
for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated
content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this
limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates
UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide
modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of
denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts
containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is
counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model
governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate
that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive
power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both
object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

### [7] [Improving Masked Style Transfer using Blended Partial Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05769)
*Seyed Hadi Seyed,Ayberk Cansever,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于部分卷积的风格迁移网络，专注于对图像特定区域进行风格迁移，避免了传统方法中风格特征捕捉不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对整个图像进行风格迁移后通过掩码处理特定区域，但会导致风格特征在感兴趣区域中捕捉不准确。

Method: 采用部分卷积网络，结合内部混合技术，精确地将风格特征应用于感兴趣区域。

Result: 在SA-1B数据集上验证了该方法在视觉和定量上的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了区域风格迁移中的问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of
convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the
artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need
to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard
practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows
that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region
of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that
accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest.
Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for
imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and
quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/StyleTransferMasked.

### [8] [MAISI-v2: Accelerated 3D High-Resolution Medical Image Synthesis with Rectified Flow and Region-specific Contrastive Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05772)
*Can Zhao,Pengfei Guo,Dong Yang,Yucheng Tang,Yufan He,Benjamin Simon,Mason Belue,Stephanie Harmon,Baris Turkbey,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAISI-v2是一种加速的3D医学图像合成框架，通过整合rectified flow实现快速高质量生成，并引入区域特异性对比损失提升条件一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在医学图像合成中的通用性差、推理速度慢和输入条件对齐弱的问题。

Method: 整合rectified flow加速生成，引入区域特异性对比损失增强条件一致性。

Result: MAISI-v2实现了33倍的加速，并达到SOTA图像质量，合成图像可用于数据增强。

Conclusion: MAISI-v2在加速和条件一致性方面显著改进，为医学图像合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research
applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this
area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited
generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings,
(2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak
alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging.
MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but
still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this
work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis
framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality
generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel
region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of
interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality
with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be
used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model
weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further
development within the community.

### [9] [Few-Shot Deployment of Pretrained MRI Transformers in Brain Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05783)
*Mengyu Li,Guoyao Shen,Chad W. Farris,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练MRI变换器的少样本部署框架，通过MAE策略和混合架构MAE-FUnet，在数据有限条件下实现了高效、稳定的脑成像任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中标注数据稀缺导致变换器模型实际应用受限的问题。

Method: 采用MAE预训练策略在大规模多队列脑MRI数据集上获取可迁移的潜在表示，结合轻量级线性头或混合架构MAE-FUnet进行任务适配。

Result: 在MRI序列识别、颅骨剥离和多类解剖分割任务中达到SOTA性能，尤其在数据有限条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架高效、稳定且可扩展，适用于低资源临床环境和广泛神经影像应用。

Abstract: Machine learning using transformers has shown great potential in medical
imaging, but its real-world applicability remains limited due to the scarcity
of annotated data. In this study, we propose a practical framework for the
few-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging
tasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a
large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices,
we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well
across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a
frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal
supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a
hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE
embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both
skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited
conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our
framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its
suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging
applications.

### [10] [Optimization-Free Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05813)
*Raphael Du Sablon,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建或优化的3D高斯溅射风格迁移方法，通过生成图结构实现快速风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要重建或优化溅射表示，效率较低，因此提出一种无需训练或优化的快速方法。

Method: 在溅射表示的隐式表面上生成图结构，使用前馈表面风格化方法并插值回溅射。

Result: 实现快速风格化（2分钟内），支持任意风格图像和3D高斯溅射，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，适用于多种场景，代码已公开。

Abstract: The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many
previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while
incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on
the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free
approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph
structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A
feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated
back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and
3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization.
This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2
minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results
this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer
methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/davidmhart/FastSplatStyler.

### [11] [MZEN: Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF for 3-D Reconstruction with Unknown Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05819)
*Jong-Ik Park,Carlee Joe-Wong,Gary K. Fedder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MZEN是一种改进的NeRF框架，专门处理多缩放图像集，通过显式学习缩放因子和新的姿态策略，显著提升了工业检测中的细节重建能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF在多视角2D图像重建3D场景中表现优异，但在工业检测中无法捕捉微米级细节。MZEN旨在解决这一问题，通过多缩放图像集提升细节重建能力。

Method: MZEN引入可学习的缩放因子扩展针孔相机模型，并提出新的姿态策略：先解决广角图像建立全局坐标系，再通过缩放一致裁剪匹配方法处理放大图像。

Result: 在多种场景下，MZEN显著优于基线方法，PSNR提升28%，SSIM提升10%，LPIPS降低222%。

Conclusion: MZEN成功将NeRF应用于工业检测，既能保持全局精度，又能捕捉微米级细节。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods excel at 3D reconstruction from
multiple 2D images, even those taken with unknown camera poses. However, they
still miss the fine-detailed structures that matter in industrial inspection,
e.g., detecting sub-micron defects on a production line or analyzing chips with
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In these scenarios, the sensor resolution
is fixed and compute budgets are tight, so the only way to expose fine
structure is to add zoom-in images; yet, this breaks the multi-view consistency
that pose-free NeRF training relies on. We propose Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF
(MZEN), the first NeRF framework that natively handles multi-zoom image sets.
MZEN (i) augments the pin-hole camera model with an explicit, learnable zoom
scalar that scales the focal length, and (ii) introduces a novel pose strategy:
wide-field images are solved first to establish a global metric frame, and
zoom-in images are then pose-primed to the nearest wide-field counterpart via a
zoom-consistent crop-and-match procedure before joint refinement. Across eight
forward-facing scenes$\unicode{x2013}$synthetic TCAD models, real SEM of
micro-structures, and BLEFF objects$\unicode{x2013}$MZEN consistently
outperforms pose-free baselines and even high-resolution variants, boosting
PSNR by up to $28 \%$, SSIM by $10 \%$, and reducing LPIPS by up to $222 \%$.
MZEN, therefore, extends NeRF to real-world factory settings, preserving global
accuracy while capturing the micron-level details essential for industrial
inspection.

### [12] [TSMS-SAM2: Multi-scale Temporal Sampling Augmentation and Memory-Splitting Pruning for Promptable Video Object Segmentation and Tracking in Surgical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05829)
*Guoping Xu,Hua-Chieh Shao,You Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSMS-SAM2是一种新型框架，通过多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存拆分修剪机制，提升了手术视频中可提示视频对象分割与跟踪的性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频分析中，复杂运动动态和内存冗余问题限制了基础模型（如SAM2）的应用效果。

Method: 提出TSMS-SAM2框架，采用多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存拆分修剪机制，优化对象分割与跟踪。

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别达到95.24和86.73的Dice分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSMS-SAM2在复杂手术场景中表现出高效、鲁棒的分割潜力，多尺度时间增强和内存拆分策略有效。

Abstract: Promptable video object segmentation and tracking (VOST) has seen significant
advances with the emergence of foundation models like Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2); however, their application in surgical video analysis remains
challenging due to complex motion dynamics and the redundancy of memory that
impedes effective learning. In this work, we propose TSMS-SAM2, a novel
framework that enhances promptable VOST in surgical videos by addressing
challenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2
introduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation
to improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and
pruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more
efficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018
datasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73,
respectively, outperforming prior SAM-based and task-specific methods.
Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of multiscale temporal
augmentation and memory splitting, highlighting the framework's potential for
robust, efficient segmentation in complex surgical scenarios. Our source code
will be available at https://github.com/apple1986/TSMS-SAM2.

### [13] [Temporal Cluster Assignment for Efficient Real-Time Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05851)
*Ka-Wai Yung,Felix J. S. Bragman,Jialang Xu,Imanol Luengo,Danail Stoyanov,Evangelos B. Mazomenos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCA（Temporal Cluster Assignment）是一种无需微调的轻量级策略，通过利用帧间时间一致性优化视频分割中的token聚类，显著减少计算量并保持细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swin Transformer在视频分割中计算成本高，传统token剪枝方法因窗口注意力机制受限，现有聚类方法未充分利用时间冗余。

Method: 提出TCA，利用时间相关性优化token聚类，避免冗余token丢弃，保留细节。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，TCA显著提升现有聚类方法的精度与速度平衡。

Conclusion: TCA在自然和特定领域视频中均表现出色，是一种高效优化视频分割的方法。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of
segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin
Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale
representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.
However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high
computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense
prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,
resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been
proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin
requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of
conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering
approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window
consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a
key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We
introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,
fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal
coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,
TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining
fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive
evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical
video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of
existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes
competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.

*Kaiser Hamid,Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar,Nade Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉-语言框架的驾驶员视觉注意力预测方法，通过自然语言描述驾驶员注视行为，结合少样本和零样本学习，优于通用视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注静态图像的注意力分配，缺乏对动态注视行为的自然语言描述，限制了可解释性和应用范围。

Method: 利用BDD-A数据集的高质量标注，通过人类反馈优化，微调LLaVA模型，整合低层线索和上下文信息（如路线语义、风险预测）。

Result: 微调模型在注意力转移检测和可解释性上优于通用视觉语言模型，支持少样本和单样本学习。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶中的可解释AI提供了新方向，支持行为预测、人机协作等下游任务。

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving
and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on
estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using
static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a
vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze
through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB
images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using
human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception
with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both
low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation),
enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance
across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific
metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection
and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to
generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural
language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving.
Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior
forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

### [15] [Multi-view Gaze Target Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05857)
*Qiaomu Miao,Vivek Raju Golani,Jingyi Xu,Progga Paromita Dutta,Minh Hoai,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多视角相机方法用于视线目标估计（GTE），通过整合不同视角信息提升准确性，解决了单视角方法在面部遮挡、目标模糊等问题上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视角GTE方法在面对面部遮挡、目标模糊和视线外目标时表现不佳，多视角方法能有效提升准确性和适用性。

Method: 方法包括头部信息聚合（HIA）、基于不确定性的视线选择（UGS）和基于极线的场景注意力（ESA），输入为一对相机视角。

Result: 在多视角数据集上显著优于单视角基线，尤其在第二视角提供清晰面部视图时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 多视角方法不仅提升了GTE准确性，还能仅通过第二视角图像估计第一视角的视线目标，填补了单视角方法的不足。

Abstract: This paper presents a method that utilizes multiple camera views for the gaze
target estimation (GTE) task. The approach integrates information from
different camera views to improve accuracy and expand applicability, addressing
limitations in existing single-view methods that face challenges such as face
occlusion, target ambiguity, and out-of-view targets. Our method processes a
pair of camera views as input, incorporating a Head Information Aggregation
(HIA) module for leveraging head information from both views for more accurate
gaze estimation, an Uncertainty-based Gaze Selection (UGS) for identifying the
most reliable gaze output, and an Epipolar-based Scene Attention (ESA) module
for cross-view background information sharing. This approach significantly
outperforms single-view baselines, especially when the second camera provides a
clear view of the person's face. Additionally, our method can estimate the gaze
target in the first view using the image of the person in the second view only,
a capability not possessed by single-view GTE methods. Furthermore, the paper
introduces a multi-view dataset for developing and evaluating multi-view GTE
methods. Data and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本任务中表现良好，但在分布偏移下泛化能力不足，需要高效的测试时适应方法。

Method: ETTA引入递归更新模块，动态整合所有测试样本以优化决策边界，并通过自适应集成模块减少对提示的依赖。

Result: ETTA在计算复杂度和准确性上均优于现有测试时适应模型，成为新的高效适应标准。

Conclusion: ETTA通过动态更新和自适应集成，显著提升了模型在测试时的适应能力和性能。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot
performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test
data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,
training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,
current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence
samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the
influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that
integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision
boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating
contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and
computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to
reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting
optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores
from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary
strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses
the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,
setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code
has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

TL;DR: HOLODECK 2.0是一个基于视觉语言模型的3D场景生成框架，支持交互式编辑，能生成多样且语义精确的3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景生成依赖大量人工，自动化方法难以支持开放域场景或灵活编辑，因此需要直接从文本生成高质量3D场景。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）解析场景需求，结合先进3D生成模型生成资产，并通过空间约束实现语义连贯的布局。

Result: HOLODECK 2.0在人类评估和CLIP测试中表现优异，生成场景与文本描述高度一致，支持布局和风格编辑。

Conclusion: HOLODECK 2.0在游戏建模等应用中展示了高效生成沉浸式3D环境的潜力。

Abstract: 3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation,
virtual reality and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still
relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated
methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As
a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing
attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced
vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for
interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate
diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and
cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input
descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK
2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects
required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via
state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial
constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and
physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments
demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely
aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming
baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide
editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout
refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical
application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually
rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.

TL;DR: RopStitch是一种无监督的深度图像拼接框架，通过双分支架构结合内容感知的通用先验，实现高泛化性和自然性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像拼接中内容对齐与结构保持的矛盾，提升场景鲁棒性和内容自然性。

Method: 采用双分支模型分别捕获粗粒度与细粒度特征，并通过虚拟最优平面概念缓解冲突。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在场景鲁棒性和内容自然性方面。

Conclusion: RopStitch通过创新架构和优化策略，有效提升了图像拼接的性能。

Abstract: We present \textit{RopStitch}, an unsupervised deep image stitching framework
with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of
\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content
perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It
separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve
highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.
Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture
semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract
fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a
controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content
alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we
propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this
end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition
coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal
semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is
finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the
optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets
demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness. The code is available
at {\color{red}https://github.com/MmelodYy/RopStitch}.

Conclusion: 神经场模型为移动摄影数据的处理提供了高效、无需复杂预处理的新途径。

Abstract: Over the past two decades, mobile imaging has experienced a profound
transformation, with cell phones rapidly eclipsing all other forms of digital
photography in popularity. Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse
range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,
and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated
chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile
pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in
recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map
continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the
reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as
pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully
designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and
lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer
separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile
photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without
relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine
learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized
models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient
descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.

Abstract: Monitoring construction progress is crucial yet resource-intensive, prompting
the exploration of computer-vision-based methodologies for enhanced efficiency
and scalability. Traditional data acquisition methods, primarily focusing on
indoor environments, falter in construction site's complex, cluttered, and
dynamically changing conditions. This paper critically evaluates the
application of two advanced 3D segmentation methods, Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and Mask3D, in challenging outdoor and indoor conditions. Trained
initially on indoor datasets, both models' adaptability and performance are
assessed in real-world construction settings, highlighting the gap in current
segmentation approaches due to the absence of benchmarks for outdoor scenarios.
Through a comparative analysis, this study not only showcases the relative
effectiveness of SAM and Mask3D but also addresses the critical need for
tailored segmentation workflows capable of extracting actionable insights from
construction site data, thereby advancing the field towards more automated and
precise monitoring techniques.

Conclusion: SINGAD通过自监督优化和几何误差传播，显著提升了单图像法线估计的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal
estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have
demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on
data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface
interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the
discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity
in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric
errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby
forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper
proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for
Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating
physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based
reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into
normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric
inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a
light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale
geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring
multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed
within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain
normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.
Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for
self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the
reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal
datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across
multiple metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在训练成本高和图像表示未预训练的问题，同时保留MLLMs的多模态推理能力。

Method: 使用patch级CLIP图像嵌入作为潜在变量，轻量级ControlNet适配扩散模型，并初始化MLLM的视觉生成分支。

Result: Bifrost-1在视觉保真度和多模态理解上表现优异，训练计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Bifrost-1通过巧妙设计，高效整合了MLLMs和扩散模型，实现了高质量的图像生成。

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis
capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their
strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or
bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the
backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We
present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent
variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder.
These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with
a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation
branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the
patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and
diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables
high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training
efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or
better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and
multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We
also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our
design choices.

Motivation: 机器人操作中高级任务语义与低级几何特征之间的脱节问题，以及现有视觉语言模型缺乏语义基础和依赖人工标注的局限性。

Method: 提出PASG框架，包括自动几何基元提取、VLM驱动的语义锚定，以及空间语义推理基准和微调VLM（Qwen2.5VL-PA）。

Result: PASG在多样化机器人操作任务中表现优异，性能接近人工标注，实现了更细粒度的语义-功能理解。

Conclusion: PASG为机器人操作中几何基元与任务语义的统一提供了新范式。

Abstract: The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric
features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware
visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and
reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic
semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware
Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)
Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling
cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic
anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional
affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning
benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's
effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,
achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a
finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a
unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in
robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: AnimateScene有效解决了3D场景与4D人体动画整合的多个关键问题，实现了高质量的视觉效果。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have seen rapid progress and
broad adoption in recent years. However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed
scenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains
challenging. One key difficulty lies in placing the human at the correct
location and scale within the scene while avoiding unrealistic
interpenetration. Another challenge is that the human and the background may
exhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In
addition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera
movements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a
specified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues
in a unified framework. First, we design an accurate placement module that
automatically determines a plausible 3D position for the human and prevents any
interpenetration within the scene during motion. Second, we propose a
training-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to
match the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual
integration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the
4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,
enabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera
movements. Extensive experiments show that AnimateScene generates dynamic scene
videos with high geometric detail and spatiotemporal coherence across various
camera and action combinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度补全模型在从源数据转移到目标数据时，由于协变量偏移，预测结果往往不准确。需要一种无需目标数据先验的方法来适应新环境。

Result: 在三个室内和三个室外数据集上，ETA平均分别提升了10.23%和6.94%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ETA是一种有效的测试时适应方法，能够显著提升深度补全模型在新环境中的性能。

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion
models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict
erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel
environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies
in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data
distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution
(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions
regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a
mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model
that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.
We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to
minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the
source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',
or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor
datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an
average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors. Project Page:

Result: 在多个视频计算机视觉任务中，该方法实现了显著加速，仅带来轻微性能损失。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化前端计算和运动估计，显著提升了视频计算机视觉系统的效率。

Abstract: The efficiency of video computer vision system remains a challenging task due
to the high temporal redundancy inside a video. Existing works have been
proposed for efficient vision computer vision. However, they do not fully
reduce the temporal redundancy and neglect the front end computation overhead.
In this paper, we propose an efficient video computer vision system. First,
image signal processor is removed and Bayer-format data is directly fed into
video computer vision models, thus saving the front end computation. Second,
instead of optical flow models and video codecs, a fast block matching-based
motion estimation algorithm is proposed specifically for efficient video
computer vision, with a MV refinement module. To correct the error,
context-aware block refinement network is introduced to refine regions with
large error. To further balance the accuracy and efficiency, a frame selection
strategy is employed. Experiments on multiple video computer vision tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves significant acceleration with slight
performance loss.

Abstract: Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer
interaction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025
competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To
address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models
to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.
Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder
that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial
representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched
method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the
input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a
fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms
for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original
representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in
the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a
substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the
MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to
78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Motivation: 现有方法因缺乏结构化配对数据，导致化妆细节粗糙且难以平衡身份和化妆保真度。

Method: 引入MakeupQuad数据集，并提出EvoMakeup框架，通过多阶段蒸馏避免图像退化。

Result: EvoMakeup在真实场景中表现优异，支持全脸、局部和文本驱动的化妆编辑。

Conclusion: 该方法在化妆保真度和身份保留上表现优越，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Facial makeup editing aims to realistically transfer makeup from a reference
to a target face. Existing methods often produce low-quality results with
coarse makeup details and struggle to preserve both identity and makeup
fidelity, mainly due to the lack of structured paired data -- where source and
result share identity, and reference and result share identical makeup. To
address this, we introduce MakeupQuad, a large-scale, high-quality dataset with
non-makeup faces, references, edited results, and textual makeup descriptions.
Building on this, we propose EvoMakeup, a unified training framework that
mitigates image degradation during multi-stage distillation, enabling iterative
improvement of both data and model quality. Although trained solely on
synthetic data, EvoMakeup generalizes well and outperforms prior methods on
real-world benchmarks. It supports high-fidelity, controllable, multi-task
makeup editing -- including full-face and partial reference-based editing, as
well as text-driven makeup editing -- within a single model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior makeup fidelity and
identity preservation, effectively balancing both aspects. Code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing
benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or
processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by
real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address
this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising
2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in
authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text
and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three
primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and
irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14
subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability
categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three
difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical
reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we
design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their
performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the
problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in
realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis
of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their
recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining
directions for future improvements. Data and code:

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time

with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate
from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address

camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video
diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with
these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate
our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene
exploration. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
3DGS-based methods, enabling high-quality, artifact-free rendering from
arbitrary viewpoints.

Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with
deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the
distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles.
However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle
types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class
classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less
effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for
particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as
silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining
large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively
straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to
address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment
training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural
networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples
closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure.
To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training
datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising
500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves
classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote
open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion
models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with
a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at

TL;DR: Spectrum提出了一种统一网络，用于像素级解析（身体部位和服装）和实例级分组，通过改进的Image-to-Texture扩散模型提升细粒度解析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定掩码类别，无法区分细粒度服装类型或详细身体部位，而开放词汇分割方法通常将整个人归为一类，缺乏细节解析。

Method: Spectrum利用改进的Image-to-Texture扩散模型提取特征，并通过提示引导生成语义有效的掩码，实现细粒度解析。

Result: 实验表明，Spectrum在身体部位、服装类别和未见过的服装类别分割任务中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Spectrum通过改进的扩散模型实现了更精细的人体解析，适用于复杂场景中的多类别分割。

Abstract: Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use
fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing
types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but
typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to
distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we
propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts
and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based
open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal
representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe
that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D
texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling
stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum
introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --
obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved
alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract
human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate
semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through
prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation
maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone
garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We
conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts,
clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and
demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in
prompt-based segmentation.

Method: 采用RectifiedFlow框架，结合PerRFI反转策略、Inversion Latent Injection技术、Disentangled Prompt Guidance和Canny-conditioned ControlNet。

Result: 在PIE数据集上，InstantEdit在速度和编辑质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InstantEdit是一种高效且高质量的文本引导图像编辑方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a fast text-guided image editing method called InstantEdit based
on the RectifiedFlow framework, which is structured as a few-step editing
process that preserves critical content while following closely to textual
instructions. Our approach leverages the straight sampling trajectories of
RectifiedFlow by introducing a specialized inversion strategy called PerRFI. To
maintain consistent while editable results for RectifiedFlow model, we further
propose a novel regeneration method, Inversion Latent Injection, which
effectively reuses latent information obtained during inversion to facilitate
more coherent and detailed regeneration. Additionally, we propose a
Disentangled Prompt Guidance technique to balance editability with detail
preservation, and integrate a Canny-conditioned ControlNet to incorporate
structural cues and suppress artifacts. Evaluation on the PIE image editing
dataset demonstrates that InstantEdit is not only fast but also achieves better
qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art few-step
editing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track
(MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the
principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE)
emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input
modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge
from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU)
information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a
consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from
the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a
two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble
combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and
better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI
challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set,
ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fourier-VLM通过频域压缩视觉表示，显著减少计算开销和推理延迟，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）中视觉特征的高维度导致计算开销大、推理延迟高，现有方法在减少特征数量时往往牺牲性能或增加额外成本。

Method: 利用视觉特征在低频分量集中的特性，通过二维离散余弦变换（DCT）和快速傅里叶变换（FFT）压缩视觉表示。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，推理FLOPs减少83.8%，生成速度提升31.2%。

Conclusion: Fourier-VLM在高效性和实用性上表现突出，适用于多种VLM架构。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image
placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from
an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM).
However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context
length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While
previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or
leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise
performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose
Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual
representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit
concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a
low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$,
minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional
parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks
demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong
generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it
reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2%
compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导的图像编辑方法会生成整个目标图像，导致计算成本高且非编辑区域的重建偏差影响编辑质量。

Method: 通过预训练一个任意顺序的自回归文本到图像（T2I）模型，实现零样本图像编辑，并适应NEP方法。

Result: 在广泛使用的图像编辑基准测试中达到新的最优性能，并支持零样本迭代细化生成。

Conclusion: NEP方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了编辑质量和效率。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a
language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local
regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather
than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in
(1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing
non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To
resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next
Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where
only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended
modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose
to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once
trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to
NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used
image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time
scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot
manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

<details>

Motivation: 现有基准测试无法提供直观、即时的性能反馈，BioMotion Arena旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用成对比较评估方法，收集了53个主流模型在90种生物运动变体上的45k+投票数据。

Result: 数据显示众包投票与专家评分一致，且90%以上模型无法生成基本的人形点光源运动。

Conclusion: BioMotion Arena可作为无真实数据限制的挑战性基准测试框架。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are
challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form
evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human
preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive,
and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we
introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual
animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual
perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes
point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between
models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect
more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion
variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good
agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our
BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over
90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and
proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light
groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables
BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance
visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on
ground-truth.

TL;DR: VQAThinker是一个基于推理的视频质量评估框架，利用多模态模型和强化学习解决现有模型的泛化性和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估模型在泛化性和可解释性上存在不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用GRPO强化学习算法，结合三种VQA特定奖励（回归、排序和时间一致性奖励）。

Result: 在领域内和OOD基准测试中表现优异，同时在失真归因和质量描述上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习为构建仅需分数监督的泛化性和可解释性VQA模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual
quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent
advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:
\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and
\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in
real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large
multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video
quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.
Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided
reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality
under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a
\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction
error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;
(2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly
determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal
consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent
videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD
VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.
Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its
superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to
existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that
reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building
generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.

Conclusion: 该方法为术前规划提供了高分辨率3D形态，减少了辐射需求，效果显著。

Abstract: To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on
low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition.
The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption
of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose
a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy
target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an
isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation
(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label
custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to
generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In
contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,
our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes
compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative
blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella
articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a
CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our
approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies
significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD).

Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for
neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape
variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from
limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing
individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint
LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships
embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation
artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying
the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our
method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate
LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections,
and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally,
we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that
show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal
controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at

Conclusion: 渐进注意力机制有效提升了手写数学表达式识别性能，自监督方法减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task
due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and
complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for
expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder
using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to
learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of
this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using
a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to
learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and
nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The
progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly
robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving
structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised
pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)
supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.
Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER
performance. Our codebase can be found here.

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer than ever to becoming a
reality, sparking widespread enthusiasm in the research community to collect
and work with various modalities, including text, image, video, and audio.
Despite recent efforts, satellite spectral imagery, as an additional modality,
has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This area presents unique
challenges, but also holds great promise in advancing the capabilities of AGI
in understanding the natural world. In this paper, we argue why Earth
Observation data is useful for an intelligent model, and then we review
existing benchmarks and highlight their limitations in evaluating the
generalization ability of foundation models in this domain. This paper
emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate earth
observation models. To facilitate this, we propose a comprehensive set of tasks
that a benchmark should encompass to effectively assess a model's ability to
understand and interact with Earth observation data.

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络（DNNs）内部表示不透明的问题，尤其是FMCE方法缺乏实验验证和闭环集成的局限性。

Method: 提出FMCE-Net++框架，集成预训练的FMCE-Net作为辅助头，生成FMCS预测，并通过表示辅助损失（RAL）动态平衡分类损失和特征收敛优化。

Conclusion: FMCE-Net++能有效提升模型性能，验证了其在优化特征收敛方面的有效性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their
opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation
(FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores
(FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To
address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that
integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module
generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise
backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL
dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence
optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive
experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without
architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes
include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp
(ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HybridEVS相机结合Quad Bayer CFA传感器和事件像素时，由于事件像素缺乏颜色信息，会导致去马赛克过程中的伪影和混叠问题，现有方法难以在资源有限的移动设备上有效解决。

Method: TSANet采用两阶段网络设计，分别处理事件像素修复和去马赛克，并引入轻量级的Cross-Swin State Block，利用位置先验和状态空间模型增强全局依赖关系。

Result: TSANet在模拟和真实HybridEVS数据上表现出色，PSNR和SSIM优于现有方法DemosaicFormer，同时参数和计算成本分别降低了1.86倍和3.29倍。

Conclusion: TSANet为移动设备上的高效图像去马赛克提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Event cameras like the Hybrid Event-based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) camera
capture brightness changes as asynchronous "events" instead of frames, offering
advanced application on mobile photography. However, challenges arise from
combining a Quad Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) sensor with event pixels
lacking color information, resulting in aliasing and artifacts on the
demosaicing process before downstream application. Current methods struggle to
address these issues, especially on resource-limited mobile devices. In
response, we introduce \textbf{TSANet}, a lightweight \textbf{T}wo-stage
network via \textbf{S}tate space augmented cross-\textbf{A}ttention, which can
handle event pixels inpainting and demosaicing separately, leveraging the
benefits of dividing complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Furthermore, we
introduce a lightweight Cross-Swin State Block that uniquely utilizes
positional prior for demosaicing and enhances global dependencies through the
state space model with linear complexity. In summary, TSANet demonstrates
excellent demosaicing performance on both simulated and real data of HybridEVS
while maintaining a lightweight model, averaging better results than the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NeRF的方法未显式建模眼球旋转和平移，限制了视线重定向的精确性和真实性。

Method: 使用3D高斯点云（3DGS）显式建模眼球结构，并引入自适应变形模块模拟眼部肌肉运动。

Conclusion: 显式3D眼球结构结合自适应变形模块显著提升了视线重定向的效果。

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit
3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on
neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume
rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and
translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a
dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully
reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the
3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module
that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes.
Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our
framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving
superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出SCJoint方法，通过联合学习显著目标检测（SOD）和伪装目标检测（COD）任务，利用任务特定的可学习参数解耦矛盾属性，并引入SBSS策略优化训练集。实验证明该方法有效且性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测（SOD）和伪装目标检测（COD）是两种相关但矛盾的任务。传统观点认为联合学习会降低性能，但作者提出相反观点，认为通过正确方法可以实现任务互补。

Method: 提出SCJoint联合学习方案，通过任务特定的可学习参数解耦SOD和COD的解码过程分布特征；引入SBSS策略平衡训练集并优化质量。

Result: 实验证明JoNet网络能同时捕捉显著和伪装目标，性能优越。

Conclusion: SCJoint和SBSS方法有效解决了SOD和COD任务的矛盾，实现了联合学习的优势。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two
closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are
class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the
former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter
focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the
background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory
attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these
two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.
However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to
learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both
salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint
learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,
assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution
characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and
variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal
amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network
structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at
a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy
(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set
sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and
shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a
powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to
simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive
experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our
proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/JoNet.

Motivation: 传统方法如NeRF在水下环境中因光线吸收、散射和浑浊问题导致几何和颜色保真度下降，现有扩展方法如SeaThru-NeRF的效率和解像度受限。

Method: 提出UW-3DGS框架，结合可学习的水下图像形成模块和物理感知不确定性修剪（PAUP），优化高斯分布并去除噪声。

Result: 在SeaThru-NeRF和UWBundle数据集上表现优异，PSNR达27.604，SSIM为0.868，LPIPS为0.104，浮动物体减少约65%。

Conclusion: UW-3DGS通过物理建模和自适应修剪，显著提升了水下3D重建的质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction faces severe challenges from light
absorption, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade geometry and color
fidelity in traditional methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While NeRF
extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP
reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We
introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play
learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for
spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware
Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating
Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The
pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy
Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP
pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean
Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned
physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light
transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior
performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on
SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.

Abstract: Colonoscopy is a vital tool for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer,
which is one of the main causes of cancer-related mortality globally; hence, it
is deemed an essential technique for the prevention and early detection of
colorectal cancer. The research introduces a unique multidirectional
architectural framework to automate polyp detection within colonoscopy images

TL;DR: LiLoRA是一种高效架构扩展方法，用于解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在持续视觉指令调优（CVIT）中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CVIT中灾难性遗忘和参数效率低下的问题。

Method: 共享LoRA矩阵A，对矩阵B进行低秩分解以减少任务特定参数，并引入余弦正则化稳定性损失。

Result: 在多样化CVIT基准测试中表现优异，显著提高参数效率。

Conclusion: LiLoRA在持续任务学习中表现优越，参数效率高。

Abstract: Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this
process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on
previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common
approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces
task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often
expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead
and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA
(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in
MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,
applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize
task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss
to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive
experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves
superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving
parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: DreamVE是一个基于指令的图像和视频编辑统一模型，通过两阶段训练策略（先图像后视频）和综合数据合成方法（拼贴和生成模型）实现高效编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于指令的视频编辑因训练数据不足而受限的问题，推动其实际应用。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略（图像编辑后视频编辑），结合拼贴和生成模型的数据合成方法，并设计高效的编辑框架。

Result: DreamVE在关键编辑类型上表现优异，具备良好的泛化和迁移能力，但属性编辑性能有所下降。

Conclusion: DreamVE通过统一图像和视频编辑，结合多种数据合成方法，实现了高效且灵活的指令编辑。

Abstract: Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and
efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing,
particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,
hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a
unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We
propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.
This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models
are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better
video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and
aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data
synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data
synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and
backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,
background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of
accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE
on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing
types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,
collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative
drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite
being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.
Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.
Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We
build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop
approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and
editability. The codes and models will be released.

Result: 实验表明，SIFThinker在空间理解和细粒度感知任务上优于现有方法，同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: SIFThinker通过空间感知和动态注意力修正，显著提升了复杂视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant
challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained
perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however,
they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively
refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce
SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human
visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and
image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural
language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a
reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of
interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which
in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose
GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual
grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically
correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding
and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general
capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散或流的视频生成模型需要多次迭代采样，计算开销大；而现有的蒸馏方法在少步设置下性能下降或产生更多伪影。

Method: 提出SwiftVideo框架，结合轨迹保持和分布匹配策略，引入连续时间一致性蒸馏和双视角对齐（分布对齐和轨迹对齐）。

Result: 在OpenVid-1M基准测试中，SwiftVideo在少步视频生成上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SwiftVideo通过统一稳定的蒸馏框架，实现了高效且高质量的视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in
video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs
substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are
solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been
developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer
from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and
stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of
trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach
introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise
preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective
alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data
along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method
maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number
of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
few-step video generation.

Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测模型难以处理复杂异常事件，且缺乏类别特异性特征和精确时序信息。

Method: 采用高斯溅射引导的专家混合模型（GS-MoE），每个专家专注特定异常类型，通过时序高斯损失增强弱监督。

Result: 在UCF-Crime数据集上达到91.58% AUC，在XD-Violence和MSAD数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: GS-MoE通过类别特异性专家和时序指导，为弱监督视频异常检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of
anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the
Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided
during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although
state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),
they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This
difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to
address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a
shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak
supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the
ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of
Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each
specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a
temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal
consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach
encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by
focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The
predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a
mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse
anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on
XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and
temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLM）在推理阶段处理大量视觉令牌导致高成本，现有修剪方法未能充分利用动态内部信号。

Method: 1. 动态文本引导修剪机制，利用层间文本-文本注意力图构建软优先级；2. 离线分析跨模态注意力变化，提出高效修剪策略。

Result: CUDA延迟降低61.3%，平均精度保持92.9%，在相同令牌预算下超越SOTA。

Conclusion: AdaptInfer是一种轻量级、即插即用且通用的方法，显著提升VLM推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their
inference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of
vision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods
often rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt
guidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during
inference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play
framework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a
fine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise
text-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token
importance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage.
Second, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and
identify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to
propose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is
lightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks.
Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.
For example, it reduces CUDA latency by 61.3\% while maintaining an average
accuracy of 92.9\% on vanilla LLaVA-1.5-7B. Under the same token budget,
AdaptInfer surpasses SOTA in accuracy.

Result: 实验证明该方法适用于多种图像质量，且在不同人口统计组中表现一致。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少误识别，且仅在使用先进损失函数训练的匹配器中有效。

Abstract: A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in
the probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is,
may be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one
result is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on
the similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled
images of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one
result is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and
images, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting
the ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.
We then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a
rank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets
and four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our
approach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for
probes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and
sunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that
In-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across
demographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate
of whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby
to reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted
investigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep
CNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our
Out-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using
advanced margin-based loss functions.

Motivation: 当前VQA方法依赖大规模预训练，但存在语义知识迁移不足和计算资源消耗大的问题。VLM在视觉任务中表现出色，因此探索其在VQA中的应用。

Method: 提出Q-CLIP框架，利用SCMA增强视觉和文本表示，仅需训练少量参数。引入五个可学习的质量提示，提升模型对视频质量的敏感性。

Result: Q-CLIP在多个VQA数据集上表现出色，且计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Q-CLIP为VQA提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，展示了VLM在质量评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key
research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve
performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this
strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic
knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality
depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);
(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational
resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training
directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown
remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and
have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this
work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP
enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal
Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters
and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly
reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable
quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality
variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies
on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to
better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

Abstract: Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions.
Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of
emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive
tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel
task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional
cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and
incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging
problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion
prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction
synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a
short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a
semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior,
we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by
considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a
motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions
under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will
be made publicly available at https://ereact.github.io/

Abstract: High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of
visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution
images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this,
super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related
traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on
pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image
fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This
raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into
the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this
paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship
between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a
specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases
the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions
that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our
approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained
image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成框架UGD-IML，首次将IML和CIML任务统一在一个框架中，减少了对大规模标注数据的依赖，并在性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字时代中，高级图像编辑工具威胁视觉内容的真实性，现有IML方法依赖大规模标注数据，但数据集规模不足且多样性有限，CIML方法又存在流程复杂的问题。

Method: 提出UGD-IML框架，利用扩散模型学习数据分布，通过类别嵌入机制和参数共享设计，实现IML和CIML任务的无缝切换，并采用端到端设计简化标注流程。

Result: 在多个数据集上，UGD-IML在IML和CIML任务中的F1指标分别平均优于SOTA方法9.66和4.36，同时在不确定性估计、可视化和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: UGD-IML通过生成模型和高效设计，显著提升了图像篡改定位的性能和实用性，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the
integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a
key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods
rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated
datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,
limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent
studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level
annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches
often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process
inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on
diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and
CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data
distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on
large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even
under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding
mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between
IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,
the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data
annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and
4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the
proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and
robustness.

Result: 在11个MedMNIST数据集上显著优于6种先进方法，尤其在5-shot场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架为标记成本高的医学影像应用提供了实用解决方案，能在极少标记数据下实现鲁棒分类。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is
severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a
novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for
low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled
samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --
a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for
authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --
within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between
supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that
leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather
than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that
combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier
with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling
reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across
eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically
significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised
methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting
where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains
its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per
class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging
applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust
classification performance even with minimal labeled data. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在处理噪声标签时容易过拟合，且缺乏跨模态一致性建模。MCA旨在通过联合校正和对齐策略提升检索性能。

Method: MCA包含MJC机制（利用多模态历史预测进行标签校正）和MAA策略（多级特征对齐增强语义区分）。

Result: 实验表明MCA在常规和噪声3D基准测试中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MCA在噪声标签条件下表现出强大的鲁棒性和有效性，为跨模态检索提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing availability of 2D and 3D data, significant advancements
have been made in the field of cross-modal retrieval. Nevertheless, the
existence of imperfect annotations presents considerable challenges, demanding
robust solutions for 2D-3D cross-modal retrieval in the presence of noisy label
conditions. Existing methods generally address the issue of noise by dividing
samples independently within each modality, making them susceptible to
overfitting on corrupted labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust
2D-3D \textbf{M}ulti-level cross-modal adaptive \textbf{C}orrection and
\textbf{A}lignment framework (MCA). Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal
Joint label Correction (MJC) mechanism that leverages multimodal historical
self-predictions to jointly model the modality prediction consistency, enabling
reliable label refinement. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Adaptive
Alignment (MAA) strategy to effectively enhance cross-modal feature semantics
and discrimination across different levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method, MCA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both conventional and realistic noisy 3D benchmarks, highlighting its
generality and effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决自然图像-文本数据集语义对齐松散和医学数据集内容多样性低的问题，提升CLIP模型的鲁棒性和泛化性。

Method: 提出CLIPin插件，设计共享预投影器，结合对比和非对比学习。

Result: 在多样化下游任务中验证了CLIPin的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: CLIPin是一个即插即用的组件，适用于多种对比框架。

Abstract: Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically
collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak
supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation
but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for
contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability
to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose
CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated
into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment,
providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore,
two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities
respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a
plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is

Motivation: 慢性疾病（如淋巴瘤）的病灶分割需要自动测量，结合LLMs可以从放射学报告中提取病灶特征描述，提升分割效果。

Method: 研究使用公开的ULS23 DeepLesion数据集和报告中的简短描述，将文本信息整合到Swin-UMamba架构中，提出Text-Swin-UMamba模型。

Result: 模型在测试集上取得了82%的Dice分数和6.58像素的Hausdorff距离，优于现有方法（如LanGuideMedSeg、xLSTM-UNet和nnUNet）。

Conclusion: Text-Swin-UMamba模型在病灶分割任务中表现出色，结合文本和影像信息的方法具有潜力。

Abstract: Segmentation of lesions on CT enables automatic measurement for clinical
assessment of chronic diseases (e.g., lymphoma). Integrating large language
models (LLMs) into the lesion segmentation workflow offers the potential to
combine imaging features with descriptions of lesion characteristics from the
radiology reports. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of integrating
text into the Swin-UMamba architecture for the task of lesion segmentation. The
publicly available ULS23 DeepLesion dataset was used along with short-form
descriptions of the findings from the reports. On the test dataset, a high Dice
Score of 82% and low Hausdorff distance of 6.58 (pixels) was obtained for

Motivation: 城市化、气候变化和农业压力增加了对环境监测的需求，而现有遥感系统在时空分辨率上存在权衡。

Method: WGAST采用条件生成对抗网络架构，包括特征提取、融合、LST重建和噪声抑制四个阶段。

Result: WGAST在定量和定性评估中优于现有方法，平均降低RMSE 17.18%，提高SSIM 11.00%。

Conclusion: WGAST能有效捕捉精细热模式，并对云干扰具有鲁棒性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the
demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface
Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from
remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer
promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m
resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative
Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra
MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning
framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative
adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature
extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage
employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from
the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,
normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the
fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to
suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy
based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN
discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the
best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves
SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and
effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33
ground-based sensors. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的自动驾驶方法依赖Transformer融合，存在计算复杂度高和缺乏空间先验的问题，限制了高分辨率特征的使用和BEV表示的有效建模。

Method: 1. 使用几何增强的LiDAR表示替代传统直方图表示；2. 提出门控Mamba融合（GM-Fusion）架构，用高效的SSM替代Transformer。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，GMF-Drive性能显著优于DiffusionDrive，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 任务特定的SSM在性能和效率上均优于通用Transformer，为自动驾驶提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end
autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a
reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental
limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of
high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from
effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for
Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two
principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited
histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar
format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical
3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba
fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with
a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM
leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture
long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the
unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the
challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive.
Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component,
demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer
in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇语义分割面临语义类别广泛且细粒度的挑战，现有弱监督方法依赖类别特定监督和不适合对比学习的特征构建方法，导致语义对齐差和性能低下。

Method: SynSeg采用MCCL策略结合FSS框架，通过多类别对比学习和特征重构提升语义定位和区分能力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SynSeg表现优于现有方法，如VOC提升4.5%，Context提升8.9%。

Conclusion: SynSeg通过MCCL和FSS有效解决了开放词汇语义分割的挑战，显著提升了弱监督下的性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories.
Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision
and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading
to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs
Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a
new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS).
Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category
alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of
correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS
reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior
fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the
foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg
effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination
under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance,
SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on
Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.

Conclusion: SC-Captioner通过强化学习框架和精细的奖励设计，提升了图像描述的准确性和质量。

Abstract: We propose SC-Captioner, a reinforcement learning framework that enables the
self-correcting capability of image caption models. Our crucial technique lies
in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption
corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed
into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms.
We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected
captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched
against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate
refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby
forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a
set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision
evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect
a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K
diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner
on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across
various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference
optimization training strategy.

Motivation: 评估Segment Anything Model (SAM)的可迁移漏洞，以防止其潜在风险影响下游应用。

Method: 提出Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA)，通过参数化单纯复形表征共享脆弱区域，并迭代优化顶点。

Result: VeSCA在五个领域数据集上性能提升12.7%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAM的漏洞对下游模型构成风险，需开发更鲁棒的基础模型。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation
with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point
risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications.
Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative.
Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to
insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we
propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that
leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the
shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a
parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within
adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight
domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using
minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.
Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples
through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art
methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific
datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by
SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust
foundation models.

Abstract: Combining sparse IMUs and a monocular camera is a new promising setting to
perform real-time human motion capture. This paper proposes a diffusion-based
solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals
together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the
characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is
considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the
inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to
construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that
the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or
subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential
visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the
occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other
hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when
signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could
better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art
performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works. Our codes are

Conclusion: SDEval是一个通用框架，适用于现有安全和能力基准，为MLLMs的安全评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant
attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become
outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination
issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the
\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the
distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly
adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to
generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual
effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that
injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,
injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is
general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability
benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and
capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly
influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety
limitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal vision models have highlighted limitations
in late-stage feature fusion and suboptimal query selection for hybrid prompts
open-world segmentation, alongside constraints from caption-derived

text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations.
First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts
and backbone features at the initial encoding stage, enabling deeper
cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design
order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly
optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during
decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a
generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP)
model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path
cross-verification pipeline, reducing label noise by 80.5% compared to
conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO
achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world detection benchmarks while

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion
of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level
vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research.
Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few
making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the
inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a
novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction
with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original
convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed
DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the
receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and
feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich
concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network
architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently,
building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the
effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by
DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and
optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

TL;DR: VISTAR是一个用户为中心的多维度文本到图像（T2I）评估基准，结合确定性指标和新型HWPQ方案，显著提升评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像评估指标的局限性，提供更全面的评估方法。

Method: 采用两层级混合范式：确定性指标量化物理属性，HWPQ方案评估抽象语义。基于专家研究定义用户角色和评估角度。

Result: VISTAR指标与人类评估高度一致（>75%），HWPQ在抽象语义上达到85.9%准确率，显著优于基线。

Conclusion: VISTAR为T2I评估提供更全面的工具，揭示不同模型的优势领域，促进领域特定部署。

Abstract: We present VISTAR, a user-centric, multi-dimensional benchmark for
text-to-image (T2I) evaluation that addresses the limitations of existing
metrics. VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs
deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g.,
text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning
(HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract
semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study
with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to
construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000
human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%),
with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics,
significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals no universal champion, as role-weighted scores
reorder rankings and provide actionable guidance for domain-specific
deployment. All resources are publicly released to foster reproducible T2I
assessment.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）的早期精确诊断具有挑战性，现有深度学习方法难以捕捉脑部复杂的非线性关系。

Method: 结合多平面融合（MPF）和KANSC注意力机制，并行提取多平面特征并精确识别萎缩特征。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上表现优异，并发现AD进展中右偏侧化的结构变化。

Conclusion: MPF-KANSC框架显著提升了AD诊断性能，并具有较好的可解释性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
severely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in
AD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due
to the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep
learning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear
relationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their
ability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,
we propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane
fusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial
planes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention
mechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy
features. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction
from multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural
information. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible
and accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise
identification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments
on the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior
performance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of
right-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD
progression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.

Method: 提出PostDiff框架，包括混合分辨率去噪方案和混合模块缓存策略，以减少输入级和模块级的冗余。

Result: PostDiff显著提升了扩散模型的保真度与效率的权衡，降低每步推理成本比减少去噪步数更有效。

Conclusion: PostDiff为资源受限平台上的扩散模型部署提供了一种高效且无需微调的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet
their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited
platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal
diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,
is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a
cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps
increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model
more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes
the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training
compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,
a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by
reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training
manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme
based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising
steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation
fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to
reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the
fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to
boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing
per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of
denoising steps. Our code is available at

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes
poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly
detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level
behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches
based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal
behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.
This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic
descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses
adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term
contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event
subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal
activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset
that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,
summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets
and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety
scenarios.

Method: 提出DBIF-AUNet模型，包含DDFD模块（双域特征解耦）和BIAF模块（分支交互注意力融合），并结合嵌套深度监督机制和分层自适应混合损失。

Result: 在1622张胸水CT图像上验证，IoU和Dice分数分别达到80.1%和89.0%，优于U-Net++和Swin-UNet。

Conclusion: DBIF-AUNet显著提升了复杂胸水CT图像的分割精度，为临床诊疗提供了更可靠的辅助工具。

Abstract: Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy
and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying
disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural
effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels
between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable
morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and
complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic
gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive
Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested
skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature
Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the
functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity
and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a
Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically
with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and
frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.
Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical
adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation
on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet
achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results
outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and
Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant
optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.

Motivation: 现有异常检测方法通常针对特定异常类型，泛化能力有限，无法适应多种场景。

Result: 在8个数据集上的实验表明，AnomalyMoE显著优于领域专用方法，达到最新性能。

Conclusion: AnomalyMoE通过分层设计和专家模块，实现了通用且高效的异常检测。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task across numerous domains and modalities,
yet existing methods are often highly specialized, limiting their
generalizability. These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types
like textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance
when deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,
we propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based
on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the
complex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:
local structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global
logical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert
networks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in
reconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic
level. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently
understand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce
an Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an
Expert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization
of all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial
imaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical
anomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art
performance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their
respective domains.

Conclusion: PA-HOI数据集通过与现有运动生成方法结合，验证了其传递真实物理感知的能力，为相关领域提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The Human-Object Interaction (HOI) task explores the dynamic interactions
between humans and objects in physical environments, providing essential
biomechanical and cognitive-behavioral foundations for fields such as robotics,
virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. However, existing HOI data
sets focus on details of affordance, often neglecting the influence of physical
properties of objects on human long-term motion. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the PA-HOI Motion Capture dataset, which highlights the impact of
objects' physical attributes on human motion dynamics, including human posture,
moving velocity, and other motion characteristics. The dataset comprises 562
motion sequences of human-object interactions, with each sequence performed by
subjects of different genders interacting with 35 3D objects that vary in size,
shape, and weight. This dataset stands out by significantly extending the scope
of existing ones for understanding how the physical attributes of different
objects influence human posture, speed, motion scale, and interacting
strategies. We further demonstrate the applicability of the PA-HOI dataset by
integrating it with existing motion generation methods, validating its capacity
to transfer realistic physical awareness.

Motivation: SvdH评分在临床实践中因复杂性难以广泛应用，手动评分效率低下，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）提取疾病相关图像区域；2）基于注意力机制的多实例学习生成图像级特征进行预测。提出两种区域提取方案：异常区域采样和关节区域裁剪。

Result: 最佳模型PCC达0.943，RMSE为15.73；集成学习进一步提升至PCC 0.945和RMSE 15.57，接近放射科医生水平（PCC=0.97，RMSE=18.75）。

Conclusion: 该方法高效识别RA相关解剖结构，决策依据与临床医生一致，性能达到先进水平。

Abstract: The Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) score has been widely used in clinical trials
to quantify radiographic damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but its
complexity has limited its adoption in routine clinical practice. To address
the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for
interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.
Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using
attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for
prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles
most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing
disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction
model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root
mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted
prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving
state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced
radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively
identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians
consider relevant to RA progression.

Result: 在Potsdam、Vaihingen和LoveDA数据集上分别达到88.57%、81.46%和53.55%的mIoU。

Conclusion: TEFormer有效提升了城市遥感图像语义分割的准确性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for
applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However,
geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial
structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.
Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and
overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and
diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To
tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer
(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for
semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is
designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar
categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch
decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for
multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module
(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to
realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer
achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and
LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic
segmentation.

Abstract: Depth information is essential in computer vision, particularly in underwater
imaging, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, conventional
augmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model
robustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce
Depth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural
depth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth
offsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth
perturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter
on two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on
model stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare
Depth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,
analyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss
functions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods
in absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and
generalization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the
potential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a
foundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies. The
proposed technique is publicly available to support advancements in depth-aware
augmentation. The code is publicly available on

Conclusion: 提出的全能去模糊方法高效且通用，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental
task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing
approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types,
thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods
implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not
practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first
all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected
by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in
low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE)
decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the
recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an
end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance
comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness and generalization capabilities on unseen blur degradation
scenarios.

Abstract: The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques
remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt
foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this
work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a
parameter-efficient adaptation of a pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. The
proposed method, LNCLIP-DF, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters
(0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical
feature manifold using L2 normalization and latent space augmentations.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation on 13 benchmark datasets spanning from
2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC.
Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired
real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut
learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic
datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older,
diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.
  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method,
proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted,
minimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model. The code will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Result: 在BigEarthNet-S2和EuroSAT数据集上，FedX显著减少了参数数量并提升了泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedX有效降低了通信开销，同时优于未剪枝模型和现有剪枝方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural
networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client
stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This
makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image
classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal
and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is
the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model
updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses
explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the
size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages
backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific
importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the
central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,
substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label
scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene
classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success
of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while
enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both
unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FedX.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XAG-Net是一种基于2.5D U-Net的新架构，通过像素级跨切片注意力和跳跃注意力门控机制，提高了股骨MRI分割的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D和3D深度学习方法在股骨MRI分割中存在局限性，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出XAG-Net，结合像素级跨切片注意力（CSA）和跳跃注意力门控（AG）机制，优化切片间上下文建模和切片内特征细化。

Result: XAG-Net在股骨分割精度上优于基线2D、2.5D和3D U-Net模型，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: XAG-Net是一种高效且准确的股骨MRI分割框架，CSA和AG模块对其性能至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of femur structures from Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) is critical for orthopedic diagnosis and surgical planning but remains
challenging due to the limitations of existing 2D and 3D deep learning-based
segmentation approaches. In this study, we propose XAG-Net, a novel 2.5D
U-Net-based architecture that incorporates pixel-wise cross-slice attention
(CSA) and skip attention gating (AG) mechanisms to enhance inter-slice
contextual modeling and intra-slice feature refinement. Unlike previous
CSA-based models, XAG-Net applies pixel-wise softmax attention across adjacent
slices at each spatial location for fine-grained inter-slice modeling.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that XAG-Net surpasses baseline 2D, 2.5D, and
3D U-Net models in femur segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the CSA and
AG modules, establishing XAG-Net as a promising framework for efficient and
accurate femur MRI segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种数据高效的无标注跨域视频时间定位方法（URPA），通过少量无标注目标域视频实现跨域知识迁移，解决了GRPO依赖标注数据和高计算开销的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如GRPO）依赖标注数据且计算开销大，难以在无标注域和实时场景中应用。

Method: 提出URPA方法，利用GRPO生成多个候选预测，通过平均和方差估计置信度，加权训练奖励以实现无标注跨域适应。

Result: 在三个数据集的六种跨域设置中，URPA仅需少量无标注视频即可实现良好泛化。

Conclusion: URPA解决了无标注跨域视频时间定位的挑战，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments
matching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they
often struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group
Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a
reinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving
strong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it
unsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and
expensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces
prohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for
real-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient
Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first
trained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only
a small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach
eliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and
storage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.
Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain
knowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.
URPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages
them to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across
these rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the
model to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across
six cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few
unlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.

*Xin Ci Wong,Duygu Sarikaya,Kieran Zucker,Marc De Kamps,Nishant Ravikumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型的合成心脏MR图像方法，解决领域偏移问题，提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏MR成像因设备和协议差异导致领域偏移，影响AI模型在实际场景中的表现，传统方法效果有限。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成合成心脏MR图像，保持结构和空间一致性，用于领域泛化和领域适应。

Result: 在未见目标领域数据上，分割性能显著提升（p < 0.01），优于仅使用真实数据训练的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少对迁移学习的需求，特别适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain
shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This
challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,
where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve
increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or
additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.
Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural
consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in
creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)
trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that
resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural
fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the
segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in
multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and
vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,
domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain
data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the
source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation
performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based
metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on
real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning
or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image
analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.

*Patrick Takenaka,Johannes Maucher,Marco F. Huber*

TL;DR: 改进ViPro模型，使其能够从观测中正确推断状态，无需初始真实状态，并在无监督方式下实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ViPro模型因依赖初始真实状态而无法在噪声环境下准确预测的问题。

Method: 在ViPro基础上添加改进，使其能无监督地从观测推断状态，并扩展3D数据集。

Result: 模型能够无监督地推断状态，且适用于更接近真实世界的3D场景。

Conclusion: 改进后的ViPro模型在无监督状态下表现更优，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: Predicting future video frames is a challenging task with many downstream
applications. Previous work has shown that procedural knowledge enables deep
models for complex dynamical settings, however their model ViPro assumed a
given ground truth initial symbolic state. We show that this approach led to
the model learning a shortcut that does not actually connect the observed
environment with the predicted symbolic state, resulting in the inability to
estimate states given an observation if previous states are noisy. In this
work, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctly
infer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state in
the beginning. We show that this is possible in an unsupervised manner, and
extend the original Orbits dataset with a 3D variant to close the gap to real
world scenarios.

*Kieran Elrod,Katherine Flanigan,Mario Bergés*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用街景图像和大型语言模型分析城市社交互动质量，验证了街景数据可用于研究社交互动与城市环境的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注行人数量而非社交互动质量，街景图像作为低成本数据源可能隐含社交信息。

Method: 分析15个城市的2,998张街景图像，结合Mehta的社交分类理论，使用线性回归模型控制变量。

Result: 天空视野指数与所有社交类型相关，绿色视野指数预测持久社交，地方依恋与短暂社交正相关。

Conclusion: 街景图像可作为研究城市社交互动的工具，支持跨文化理论验证和城市设计。

Abstract: Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet
existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than
the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --
an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social
information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social
science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images
from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's
taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative
example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or
complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression
models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian
counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with
city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with
environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived
from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban
planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability
types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place
attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results
provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer
relationships between specific types of social interactions and built
environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as
a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling
cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant
cities.

Result: VA-GPT在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，表现优异。

Conclusion: VA-GPT通过优化令牌选择与生成，显著提升了异常事件检测与定位的准确性。

Abstract: Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that
has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although
current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are
capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies
due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the
redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these
challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of
Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose
VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in
various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual
encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token
Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules
enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal
information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate
responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following
dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a
cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

Method: 使用分裂Bregman方法最小化改进的Chan-Vese能量模型，实现两阶段分割。

Result: 算法在不同参数下对多幅图像进行了测试，性能良好。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适用于两阶段图像分割任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image
segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in
\cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into
foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned
membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the
segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be
summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are
smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is
a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally
proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image
data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.
Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so
that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman
method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed
implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance
with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.

TL;DR: TaAM-CPT是一种通过文本数据构建通用表示模型的方法，支持无限模态扩展，无需模态特定标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量模态特定标注数据或仅适用于单一模态，限制了通用性和扩展性。

Method: TaAM-CPT结合模态提示池、文本构建和模态对齐文本编码器，设计跨模态学习目标。

Result: TaAM-CPT在视频、图像和音频分类任务中取得领先结果，无需模态特定标注数据。

Conclusion: TaAM-CPT展示了通过文本数据构建通用表示模型的潜力，具有高度扩展性。

Abstract: The integration of prompt tuning with multimodal learning has shown
significant generalization abilities for various downstream tasks. Despite
advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific
labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single
modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt
Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general
representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data.
TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and
modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for
extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned
text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT
designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category
details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across
different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained
models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited
modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT
achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities,
including video classification, image classification, and audio classification.

Motivation: 稀疏视角下3D重建存在未观测区域伪影问题，现有方法使用VDMs生成密集观测但采样速度慢。

Method: 提出视频扩散模型蒸馏方法，将多步去噪教师模型蒸馏为少步去噪学生模型，结合GAN和软化反向KL散度最小化。

Result: 实验表明，FVGen在相似（或更好）视觉质量下，采样时间减少90%以上。

Conclusion: FVGen显著提升稀疏输入视角下3D重建任务的时间效率。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from
dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading
to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models
(VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views
are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these
methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present
FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel
view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel
video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising
teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous
works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or
even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%.
FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction
tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where
pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial
coverage.

Abstract: SAR ship classification faces the challenge of long-tailed datasets, which
complicates the classification of underrepresented classes. Oversampling
methods have proven effective in addressing class imbalance in optical data. In
this paper, we evaluated the effect of oversampling in the feature space for
SAR ship classification. We propose two novel algorithms inspired by the

over the original M2m and baselines, with an average F1-score increase of 8.82%
for FuSARShip and 4.44% for OpenSARShip.

Abstract: Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success
in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still
suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the
background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior
works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,
exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce
TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language
modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates
pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel
uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to
estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated
uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the
adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To
further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal
soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature
spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision
model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as
both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are
attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their
captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and
negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms
previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and
complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 模块化和多样化的图表生成方法有效提升了MLLMs的图表理解能力，ECD数据集为未来研究提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a
central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are
still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging
benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are
often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could
compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this
study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual
details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a
five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation
for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on
earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated
figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer
(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of
fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which
contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring
250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD
consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world
and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at:

Conclusion: Lightswitch在效率和一致性上优于现有方法，适用于多样材质物体的重光照。

Abstract: Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D
image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D
representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless,
generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input
image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be
inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar
relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned
material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary
number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues
from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material
information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method
consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with
diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction
quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly
relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or
outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting
synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the
development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding
natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which
accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a
correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally
appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these
MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,
which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address
this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization
(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer
generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a
theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from
first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B
and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple
challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative
improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks
designed to test generalization and semantic understanding. Resources are

### [102] [A Framework for Inherently Safer AGI through Language-Mediated Active Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05766)
*Bo Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合主动推理原则与大型语言模型（LLMs）的新型框架，旨在开发安全的通用人工智能（AGI）。通过透明信念表示和分层价值对齐，将安全性保障融入系统核心设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI安全方法（如事后可解释性和奖励工程）存在根本性局限，需将安全性融入系统核心设计。

Method: 提出多智能体架构，利用自然语言表示信念，实现人类直接监督。通过分层马尔可夫毯组织智能体，采用资源感知的自由能最小化实现有限理性。

Result: 框架通过自然语言分离信念与偏好、模块化智能体结构等机制确保安全性。

Conclusion: 该框架为AGI开发提供了内在安全性路径，未来研究将基于ARC基准验证其安全性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language
Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on
post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations.
We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the
system's core design through transparent belief representations and
hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a
medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human
oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture
implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active
Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through
hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring
safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in
natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy
minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures.
The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our
framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI
development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety
measures.

Motivation: 探讨神经网络是否具备类似人类思维的符号化能力，并重新评估符号系统在人类认知中的作用。

Method: 通过分析现代神经网络的表现，论证其与人类思维的相似性，并指出符号系统在训练数据中的作用。

Result: 神经网络展示了类似符号系统的能力，但符号系统在定义抽象问题中仍不可或缺。

Conclusion: 提出重新研究人类思维的符号基础的新议程。

Abstract: Some of the strongest evidence that human minds should be thought about in
terms of symbolic systems has been the way they combine ideas, produce novelty,
and learn quickly. We argue that modern neural networks -- and the artificial
intelligence systems built upon them -- exhibit similar abilities. This
undermines the argument that the cognitive processes and representations used
by human minds are symbolic, although the fact that these neural networks are
typically trained on data generated by symbolic systems illustrates that such
systems play an important role in characterizing the abstract problems that
human minds have to solve. This argument leads us to offer a new agenda for
research on the symbolic basis of human thought.

Motivation: 现有 XAI 方法主要服务于开发者，未能满足多样化利益相关者的需求，且缺乏对假设测试的支持。

Method: H-XAI 整合因果评分与 XAI 方法，支持交互式问题提出、假设测试，并与随机和偏见基线对比。

Result: 通过两个案例研究（信用风险分类和金融时间序列预测），验证了 H-XAI 的通用性和实用性。

Conclusion: H-XAI 填补了现有 XAI 方法的空白，通过结合因果评分和后验解释，满足利益相关者在个体决策和整体模型层面的需求。

Abstract: Current eXplainable AI (XAI) methods largely serve developers, often focusing
on justifying model outputs rather than supporting diverse stakeholder needs. A
recent shift toward Evaluative AI reframes explanation as a tool for hypothesis
testing, but still focuses primarily on operational organizations. We introduce
Holistic-XAI (H-XAI), a unified framework that integrates causal rating methods
with traditional XAI methods to support explanation as an interactive,
multi-method process. H-XAI allows stakeholders to ask a series of questions,
test hypotheses, and compare model behavior against automatically constructed
random and biased baselines. It combines instance-level and global
explanations, adapting to each stakeholder's goals, whether understanding
individual decisions, assessing group-level bias, or evaluating robustness
under perturbations. We demonstrate the generality of our approach through two
case studies spanning six scenarios: binary credit risk classification and
financial time-series forecasting. H-XAI fills critical gaps left by existing
XAI methods by combining causal ratings and post-hoc explanations to answer
stakeholder-specific questions at both the individual decision level and the
overall model level.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the
development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention,
particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to
perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a
specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied
navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given
their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of
such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of
safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack
strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting
a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation
technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and
robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in
embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation
strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of
verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to
provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development
of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the
findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety
and increasing industrial efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识图谱（KG）的工具检索框架，通过捕捉工具间的语义关系和功能依赖，显著提升了多步任务中的工具检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工具检索方法主要依赖用户查询与工具描述的相似性，限制了多步请求的处理能力，因此需要一种更全面的方法。

Method: 采用知识图谱建模工具间的直接和间接关系，利用1-hop ego工具图集成进行检索。

Result: 在合成数据集上，KG方法在Complete Recall指标上达到91.85%，优于非KG基线方法的89.26%。

Conclusion: 知识图谱的结构信息为工具检索提供了互补信号，特别适用于需要顺序工具组合的查询。

Abstract: Effective tool retrieval is essential for AI agents to select from a vast
array of tools when identifying and planning actions in the context of complex
user queries. Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains
underexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on
similarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly
limits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests.
To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool
retrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and
their functional dependencies. Our retrieval algorithm leverages ensembles of
1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools,
enabling more comprehensive and contextual tool selection for multi-step tasks.
We evaluate our approach on a synthetically generated internal dataset across
six defined user classes, extending previous work on coherent dialogue
synthesis and too retrieval benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our tool
graph-based method achieves 91.85% tool coverage on the micro-average Complete
Recall metric, compared to 89.26% for re-ranked semantic-lexical hybrid
retrieval, the strongest non-KG baseline in our experiments. These findings
support our hypothesis that the structural information in the KG provides
complementary signals to pure similarity matching, particularly for queries
requiring sequential tool composition.

Motivation: 现有研究多集中于语言任务，多模态场景扩展困难，且视觉语言模型在指令跟随和自反思方面较弱，限制了协作能力。

Result: 在五个医学视觉问答基准上验证，协作性能超越单个智能体，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 中介引导的多智能体协作可推动医学多模态智能发展。

Abstract: Complex medical decision-making involves cooperative workflows operated by
different clinicians. Designing AI multi-agent systems can expedite and augment
human-level clinical decision-making. Existing multi-agent researches primarily
focus on language-only tasks, yet their extension to multimodal scenarios
remains challenging. A blind combination of diverse vision-language models
(VLMs) can amplify an erroneous outcome interpretation. VLMs in general are
less capable in instruction following and importantly self-reflection, compared
to large language models (LLMs) of comparable sizes. This disparity largely
constrains VLMs' ability in cooperative workflows. In this study, we propose
MedOrch, a mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration framework for medical
multimodal decision-making. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that
enables multiple VLM-based expert agents to exchange and reflect on their
outputs towards collaboration. We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose
and domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the
strength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within
distinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent.
We validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks,
demonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training. Our
findings underscore the value of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in
advancing medical multimodal intelligence. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Result: HIMA在战略清晰度、适应性和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合专家模仿模块与元级协调，可开发更鲁棒的通用AI智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive action
sequence prediction capabilities but often struggle with dynamic, long-horizon
tasks such as real-time strategic games. In a game such as StarCraftII (SC2),
agents need to manage resource constraints and adapt to evolving battlefield
situations in a partially observable environment. This often overwhelms
exisiting LLM-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical multi-agent framework that employs specialized imitation learning
agents under a meta-controller called Strategic Planner (SP). By expert
demonstrations, each specialized agent learns a distinctive strategy, such as
aerial support or defensive maneuvers, and produces coherent, structured
multistep action sequences. The SP then orchestrates these proposals into a
single, environmentally adaptive plan that ensures local decisions aligning
with long-term strategies. We call this HIMA (Hierarchical Imitation
Multi-Agent). We also present TEXTSCII-ALL, a comprehensive SC2 testbed that
encompasses all race match combinations in SC2. Our empirical results show that
HIMA outperforms state of the arts in strategic clarity, adaptability, and
computational efficiency, underscoring the potential of combining specialized
imitation modules with meta-level orchestration to develop more robust,
general-purpose AI agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在结构化资源分配任务中的能力，并解决现有评估方法的数据污染和静态性问题。

Method: 通过三种提示策略（贪婪选择、直接优化和启发式改进）让LLMs在预算约束下选择项目子集，并与最优解对比。同时测试LLMs从自然语言输入推断偏好的能力。

Result: 结果表明提示设计对LLMs表现至关重要，且LLMs在无结构化输入的设计中具有潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs在资源分配和机制设计中展现出前景，尤其是在处理非结构化输入时。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to handle complex
decision-making tasks, yet their ability to perform structured resource
allocation remains underexplored. Evaluating their reasoning is also difficult
due to data contamination and the static nature of existing benchmarks. We
present a dual-purpose framework leveraging Participatory Budgeting (PB) both
as (i) a practical setting for LLM-based resource allocation and (ii) an
adaptive benchmark for evaluating their reasoning capabilities. We task LLMs
with selecting project subsets under feasibility (e.g., budget) constraints via
three prompting strategies: greedy selection, direct optimization, and a
hill-climbing-inspired refinement. We benchmark LLMs' allocations against a
utility-maximizing oracle. Interestingly, we also test whether LLMs can infer
structured preferences from natural-language voter input or metadata, without
explicit votes. By comparing allocations based on inferred preferences to those
from ground-truth votes, we evaluate LLMs' ability to extract preferences from
open-ended input. Our results underscore the role of prompt design and show
that LLMs hold promise for mechanism design with unstructured inputs.

TL;DR: 论文呼吁重视认知想象力在人工智能中的关键作用，并提出语义模型作为模拟认知想象力的工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知想象力在人类思维中扮演重要角色，但目前被低估，限制了AI的能力。

Method: 提出语义模型，一种基于概率因果关系的数学模型，可学习和模拟认知想象力。

Result: 语义模型能确保虚构上下文的一致性，并支持透明操作。

Conclusion: 认知想象力是AI的未来突破点，语义模型为其实现提供了可能。

Abstract: Cognitive imagination is a type of imagination that plays a key role in human
thinking. It is not a ``picture-in-the-head'' imagination. It is a faculty to
mentally visualize coherent and holistic systems of concepts and causal links
that serve as semantic contexts for reasoning, decision making and prediction.
Our position is that the role of cognitive imagination is still greatly
underestimated, and this creates numerous problems and diminishes the current
capabilities of AI. For instance, when reasoning, humans rely on imaginary
contexts to retrieve background info. They also constantly return to the
context for semantic verification that their reasoning is still reasonable.
Thus, reasoning without imagination is blind. This paper is a call for greater
attention to cognitive imagination as the next promising breakthrough in
artificial intelligence. As an instrument for simulating cognitive imagination,
we propose semantic models -- a new approach to mathematical models that can
learn, like neural networks, and are based on probabilistic causal
relationships. Semantic models can simulate cognitive imagination because they
ensure the consistency of imaginary contexts and implement a glass-box approach
that allows the context to be manipulated as a holistic and coherent system of
interrelated facts glued together with causal relations.

Motivation: 解决现有精确算法在随时行为上的不足，如不平衡搜索空间探索，以及缺乏对现有随时方法的系统比较。

Method: 提出CA-DL8.5算法，结合DL8.5的高效剪枝和缓存机制，通过模块化设计集成多种启发式和松弛机制。

Result: 实验表明，基于LDS启发式的CA-DL8.5在随时性能上表现最佳，优于其他变体和Blossom算法。

Conclusion: CA-DL8.5为决策树学习提供了一个通用框架，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Finding an optimal decision tree that minimizes classification error is known
to be NP-hard. While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic
programming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior
-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the
search is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space
exploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have
been proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not
been systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative
effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and
anytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some
existing anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous
approaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various
heuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm
reuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,
combined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning
criteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:
(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree
learning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search
strategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several
instantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k
heuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap
integral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that
CA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime
performance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom
algorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.

Conclusion: 该方法为实时自动驾驶提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in perceiving complex
environments and making real-time decisions. Traditional modular approaches,
while offering interpretability, suffer from error propagation and coordination
issues, whereas end-to-end learning systems can simplify the design but face
computational bottlenecks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous
driving using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that integrates bird's-eye view
(BEV) perception for enhanced real-time decision-making. We introduce the
\texttt{Mamba-BEV} model, an efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction
network that combines BEV-based perception with the Mamba framework for
temporal feature modeling. This integration allows the system to encode vehicle
surroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and accurately
model long-range dependencies. Building on this, we propose the
\texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} framework, which utilizes the \texttt{Mamba-BEV} model as a
feature input for end-to-end DRL, achieving superior performance in dynamic
urban driving scenarios. We further enhance the interpretability of the model
by visualizing high-dimensional features through semantic segmentation,
providing insight into the learned representations. Extensive experiments on
the CARLA simulator demonstrate that \texttt{ME$^3$-BEV} outperforms existing
models across multiple metrics, including collision rate and trajectory
accuracy, offering a promising solution for real-time autonomous driving.

Result: 证明GNNs的逻辑表达能力在无向和有向图中均超过C2逻辑。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅对GNNs的理解有贡献，还为无穷逻辑的表达能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the
expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by relating them to logical
languages. This research has been been initialised by an influential result of
Barcel\'o et al. (2020), who showed that the graded modal logic (or a guarded
fragment of the logic C2), characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine GNNs. As a ``challenging open problem'' they left the
question whether full C2 characterises the logical expressiveness of
aggregate-combine-readout GNNs. This question has remained unresolved despite
several attempts. In this paper, we solve the above open problem by proving
that the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout GNNs strictly
exceeds that of C2. This result holds over both undirected and directed graphs.
Beyond its implications for GNNs, our work also leads to purely logical
insights on the expressive power of infinitary logics.

Motivation: 解决表格推理任务中依赖标注数据或复杂数据增强的问题，以及LLM在此类任务中表现不佳的局限性。

Method: PanelTR框架利用五个科学家角色的代理科学家进行独立调查、自我审查和协作同行评审，实现语义级迁移。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，PanelTR表现优于普通LLM，接近完全监督模型，且无需训练数据。

Conclusion: 结构化科学方法可在零样本情境下有效处理复杂任务，具有灵活的语义理解能力。

Abstract: Table reasoning, including tabular QA and fact verification, often depends on
annotated data or complex data augmentation, limiting flexibility and
generalization. LLMs, despite their versatility, often underperform compared to
simple supervised models. To approach these issues, we introduce PanelTR, a
framework utilizing LLM agent scientists for robust table reasoning through a
structured scientific approach. PanelTR's workflow involves agent scientists
conducting individual investigations, engaging in self-review, and
participating in collaborative peer-review discussions. This process, driven by
five scientist personas, enables semantic-level transfer without relying on
data augmentation or parametric optimization. Experiments across four
benchmarks show that PanelTR outperforms vanilla LLMs and rivals fully
supervised models, all while remaining independent of training data. Our
findings indicate that structured scientific methodology can effectively handle
complex tasks beyond table reasoning with flexible semantic understanding in a
zero-shot context.

Result: 实验表明，SKATE能客观区分模型能力，揭示模型间的细微差异，并观察到自我偏好行为。

Conclusion: SKATE为通用、可扩展的模型评估提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities and risks of foundation models is paramount, yet
current methods demand extensive domain expertise, hindering their scalability
as these models rapidly evolve. We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation
framework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and
solving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat
evaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized
to create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others'
weaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability,
open-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and
scalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable
tasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited
programmatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial
reasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and
scalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set
code-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible
framework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking
system, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that: (1) weaker models can
reliably differentiate and score stronger ones, (2) LLM-based systems are
capable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with
their own capabilities, and (3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained
capability differences between models. Our findings are an important step
towards general, scalable evaluation frameworks which can keep pace with LLM
progress.

numerous real-world applications, mostly solved using metaheuristic algorithms
due to its $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard nature. Traditionally, these metaheuristics rely
on human-crafted designs developed through empirical studies. However, recent
research shows that machine learning methods can be used the structural
characteristics of solutions in combinatorial optimization, thereby aiding in
designing more efficient algorithms, particularly for solving VRP. Building on
this advancement, this study extends the previous research by conducting a
sensitivity analysis using multiple classifier models that are capable of
predicting the quality of VRP solutions. Hence, by leveraging explainable AI,
this research is able to extend the understanding of how these models make
decisions. Finally, our findings indicate that while feature importance varies,
certain features consistently emerge as strong predictors. Furthermore, we
propose a unified framework able of ranking feature impact across different
scenarios to illustrate this finding. These insights highlight the potential of
feature importance analysis as a foundation for developing a guidance mechanism
of metaheuristic algorithms for solving the VRP.

TL;DR: 研究通过RAG框架增强LLMs在药物禁忌领域的准确性，显著提升了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在医疗领域的应用，特别是在药物禁忌信息准确性方面的挑战。

Method: 采用RAG框架，结合GPT-4o-mini和text-embedding-3-small模型，利用Langchain构建混合检索系统，并基于DUR数据优化。

Result: 模型准确率从0.49-0.57提升至0.94、0.87和0.89，显著改善药物禁忌信息的可靠性。

Conclusion: RAG框架能有效减少药物禁忌决策中的不确定性，提升LLMs在医疗领域的应用价值。

Abstract: The versatility of large language models (LLMs) has been explored across
various sectors, but their application in healthcare poses challenges,
particularly in the domain of pharmaceutical contraindications where accurate
and reliable information is required. This study enhances the capability of
LLMs to address contraindications effectively by implementing a Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini as the base
model, and the text-embedding-3-small model for embeddings, our approach
integrates Langchain to orchestrate a hybrid retrieval system with re-ranking.
This system leverages Drug Utilization Review (DUR) data from public databases,
focusing on contraindications for specific age groups, pregnancy, and
concomitant drug use. The dataset includes 300 question-answer pairs across
three categories, with baseline model accuracy ranging from 0.49 to 0.57.
Post-integration of the RAG pipeline, we observed a significant improvement in
model accuracy, achieving rates of 0.94, 0.87, and 0.89 for contraindications
related to age groups, pregnancy, and concomitant drug use, respectively. The
results indicate that augmenting LLMs with a RAG framework can substantially
reduce uncertainty in prescription and drug intake decisions by providing more
precise and reliable drug contraindication information.

TL;DR: 该论文提出从以准确性为中心的评估转向以置信度驱动、风险感知的LLM-as-a-Judge系统，强调校准置信度的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注准确性，忽略了校准置信度的必要性，而这对可靠评估至关重要。

Method: 引入TH-Score量化过度自信现象，并提出LLM-as-a-Fuser框架，通过集成方法提升评估的可靠性和适应性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著改善了校准性能，实现了比现有基线更优的可靠性和准确性。

Conclusion: 置信度驱动的评估框架能有效提升LLM作为评估工具的可靠性和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where
practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments.
Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity
of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable
evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric
evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing
the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive
evaluation. We systematically identify the **Overconfidence Phenomenon** in
current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates
actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To
quantify this phenomenon, we introduce **TH-Score**, a novel metric measuring
confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose **LLM-as-a-Fuser**, an
ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves
calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines,
achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了GeoLaux基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在几何问题解决中的长步推理和辅助线构造能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估MLLMs几何技能的基准忽略了辅助线构造和细粒度过程评估，无法全面评估长步推理能力。

Method: 构建包含2,186个几何问题的GeoLaux基准，设计五维评估策略，并在13个领先MLLMs上进行实验。

Result: 实验发现模型在长步推理中性能显著下降，倾向于走捷径解决证明问题，且缺乏辅助线意识。

Conclusion: GeoLaux为评估MLLMs的长步几何推理能力提供了基准，并指导能力提升。

Abstract: Geometry problem solving (GPS) requires models to master diagram
comprehension, logical reasoning, knowledge application, numerical computation,
and auxiliary line construction. This presents a significant challenge for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for
evaluating MLLM geometry skills overlook auxiliary line construction and lack
fine-grained process evaluation, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs'
long-step reasoning abilities. To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux
benchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation
and proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51
reasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary
line construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional
evaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process
quality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13
leading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three
pivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in
extended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop).
Second, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when
solving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and
enhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry
reasoning improvement. These findings establish GeoLaux as both a benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' long-step geometric reasoning with auxiliary lines and a
guide for capability advancement. Our dataset and code are included in
supplementary materials and will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一概率和逻辑学习是AI领域的关键挑战，现有方法在数据效率和示例平衡方面存在不足。

Method: 采用贝叶斯归纳逻辑编程，通过先验和似然平衡假设复杂性和数据拟合，学习最小消息长度程序。

Result: 在游戏和药物设计等多个领域实验中，该方法显著优于以往方法，且数据效率高、对示例平衡不敏感。

Conclusion: 该方法在统一概率和逻辑学习方面表现出色，尤其在数据效率和示例平衡方面具有优势。

Abstract: Unifying probabilistic and logical learning is a key challenge in AI. We
introduce a Bayesian inductive logic programming approach that learns minimum
message length programs from noisy data. Our approach balances hypothesis
complexity and data fit through priors, which explicitly favour more general
programs, and a likelihood that favours accurate programs. Our experiments on
several domains, including game playing and drug design, show that our method
significantly outperforms previous methods, notably those that learn minimum
description length programs. Our results also show that our approach is
data-efficient and insensitive to example balance, including the ability to
learn from exclusively positive examples.

Abstract: The goal of inductive logic programming is to search for a hypothesis that
generalises training data and background knowledge. The challenge is searching
vast hypothesis spaces, which is exacerbated because many logically equivalent
hypotheses exist. To address this challenge, we introduce a method to break
symmetries in the hypothesis space. We implement our idea in answer set
programming. Our experiments on multiple domains, including visual reasoning
and game playing, show that our approach can reduce solving times from over an
hour to just 17 seconds.

Abstract: This technical report accompanies the LLM robustness leaderboard published by

Elicitation Tool (BET), an AI system performing automated red-teaming through
Dynamic Adversarial Optimization that achieves 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR)
against 37 of 41 state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond binary success metrics, we
propose a fine-grained robustness metric estimating the average number of
attempts required to elicit harmful behaviors, revealing that attack difficulty
varies by over 300-fold across models despite universal vulnerability. We
introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking
techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative
evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates
practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.

### [123] [A "good regulator theorem" for embodied agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06326)
*Nathaniel Virgo,Martin Biehl,Manuel Baltieri,Matteo Capucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文重新阐释了Conant和Ashby的定理，提出了一种更广义的“信念更新”模型概念，认为观察者在定义模型中起关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Conant和Ashby定理的局限性，并提出一种更广泛适用的模型理论。

Method: 通过引入“信念更新”的概念，将模型定义为观察者对系统的外部解释。

Result: 证明了无论系统是调节环境还是内部状态，观察者均可赋予其模型，解决了原有定理的局限性。

Conclusion: 模型不仅是系统的属性，更是观察者视角的产物，这一理论更具普适性。

Abstract: In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that "every good regulator of a
system must be a model of that system." Artificial Life has produced many
examples of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these
suggest Conant and Ashby's theorem doesn't easily generalise beyond its
restricted setup. Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be
fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a
regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having
"beliefs" about its environment, which it "updates" in response to sensory
input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more
sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more
broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that
the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere
property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds
regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic
control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the
model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however,
and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.

Result: 模型在未增强的测试集上达到89.17%的准确率和93.36%的AUC。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的作弊检测提供了可复现且实用的基准。

Abstract: Cheating in online video games compromises the integrity of gaming
experiences. Anti-cheat systems, such as VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat), face
significant challenges in keeping pace with evolving cheating methods without
imposing invasive measures on users' systems. This paper presents
AntiCheatPT\_256, a transformer-based machine learning model designed to detect
cheating behaviour in Counter-Strike 2 using gameplay data. To support this, we
introduce and publicly release CS2CD: A labelled dataset of 795 matches. Using
this dataset, 90,707 context windows were created and subsequently augmented to
address class imbalance. The transformer model, trained on these windows,
achieved an accuracy of 89.17\% and an AUC of 93.36\% on an unaugmented test
set. This approach emphasizes reproducibility and real-world applicability,
offering a robust baseline for future research in data-driven cheat detection.

TL;DR: 论文提出“解释性AI”作为补充范式，利用生成式AI能力作为人类理解的解释伙伴，而非算法透明度的提供者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释AI（XAI）方法过于关注算法透明度，提供的解释抽象且非自适应，难以支持用户理解。

Method: 提出八维概念模型，强调叙事沟通、自适应个性化和渐进披露原则，并通过医疗专业人员验证。

Result: 用户更偏好上下文敏感的多模态解释，而非技术透明度。

Conclusion: 需设计以人类理解为中心的AI系统，推动跨领域和文化背景的用户中心解释方法研究。

Abstract: Current explainable AI (XAI) approaches prioritize algorithmic transparency
and present explanations in abstract, non-adaptive formats that often fail to
support meaningful end-user understanding. This paper introduces "Explanatory
AI" as a complementary paradigm that leverages generative AI capabilities to
serve as explanatory partners for human understanding rather than providers of
algorithmic transparency. While XAI reveals algorithmic decision processes for
model validation, Explanatory AI addresses contextual reasoning to support
human decision-making in sociotechnical contexts. We develop a definition and
systematic eight-dimensional conceptual model distinguishing Explanatory AI
through narrative communication, adaptive personalization, and progressive
disclosure principles. Empirical validation through Rapid Contextual Design
methodology with healthcare professionals demonstrates that users consistently
prefer context-sensitive, multimodal explanations over technical transparency.
Our findings reveal the practical urgency for AI systems designed for human
comprehension rather than algorithmic introspection, establishing a
comprehensive research agenda for advancing user-centered AI explanation
approaches across diverse domains and cultural contexts.

Result: 构建了针对女性暴力案件的知识图谱，并通过能力问题验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 该知识图谱可提升法律信息的可访问性，支持复杂查询，并为预测性司法工具提供知识支持。

Abstract: Legal decision-making process requires the availability of comprehensive and
detailed legislative background knowledge and up-to-date information on legal
cases and related sentences/decisions. Legal Knowledge Graphs (KGs) would be a
valuable tool to facilitate access to legal information, to be queried and
exploited for the purpose, and to enable advanced reasoning and machine
learning applications. Indeed, legal KGs may act as knowledge intensive
component to be used by pre-dictive machine learning solutions supporting the
decision process of the legal expert. Nevertheless, a few KGs can be found in
the legal domain. To fill this gap, we developed a legal KG targeting legal
cases of violence against women, along with clear adopted methodologies.
Specifically, the paper introduces two complementary approaches for automated
legal KG construction; a systematic bottom-up approach, customized for the
legal domain, and a new solution leveraging Large Language Models. Starting
from legal sentences publicly available from the European Court of Justice, the
solutions integrate structured data extraction, ontology development, and
semantic enrichment to produce KGs tailored for legal cases involving violence
against women. After analyzing and comparing the results of the two approaches,
the developed KGs are validated via suitable competency questions. The obtained
KG may be impactful for multiple purposes: can improve the accessibility to
legal information both to humans and machine, can enable complex queries and
may constitute an important knowledge component to be possibly exploited by
machine learning tools tailored for predictive justice.

Motivation: 现有公平机器学习方法通常基于静态和冲突的偏见定义，难以适应动态社会环境，因此需要一种灵活且可随时间调整的公平性框架。

Method: 提出“Fair Game”机制，将审计员和去偏算法通过强化学习循环结合，动态调整公平性目标。

Result: “Fair Game”能够模拟社会伦理和法律框架的演变，提供灵活且适应性的公平机器学习系统。

Conclusion: “Fair Game”为公平机器学习提供了一种动态调整公平性目标的新方法，适用于部署前后的系统。

Abstract: An emerging field of AI, namely Fair Machine Learning (ML), aims to quantify
different types of bias (also known as unfairness) exhibited in the predictions
of ML algorithms, and to design new algorithms to mitigate them. Often, the
definitions of bias used in the literature are observational, i.e. they use the
input and output of a pre-trained algorithm to quantify a bias under concern.
In reality,these definitions are often conflicting in nature and can only be
deployed if either the ground truth is known or only in retrospect after
deploying the algorithm. Thus,there is a gap between what we want Fair ML to
achieve and what it does in a dynamic social environment. Hence, we propose an
alternative dynamic mechanism,"Fair Game",to assure fairness in the predictions
of an ML algorithm and to adapt its predictions as the society interacts with
the algorithm over time. "Fair Game" puts together an Auditor and a Debiasing
algorithm in a loop around an ML algorithm. The "Fair Game" puts these two
components in a loop by leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL algorithms
interact with an environment to take decisions, which yields new observations
(also known as data/feedback) from the environment and in turn, adapts future
decisions. RL is already used in algorithms with pre-fixed long-term fairness
goals. "Fair Game" provides a unique framework where the fairness goals can be
adapted over time by only modifying the auditor and the different biases it
quantifies. Thus,"Fair Game" aims to simulate the evolution of ethical and
legal frameworks in the society by creating an auditor which sends feedback to
a debiasing algorithm deployed around an ML system. This allows us to develop a
flexible and adaptive-over-time framework to build Fair ML systems pre- and
post-deployment.

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可为设计新投票系统提供依据，并支持社会选择领域的数据驱动研究。

Abstract: Committee-selection problems arise in many contexts and applications, and
there has been increasing interest within the social choice research community
on identifying which properties are satisfied by different multi-winner voting
rules. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework to evaluate how
frequently voting rules violate axioms across diverse preference distributions
in practice, shifting away from the binary perspective of axiom satisfaction
given by worst-case analysis. Using this framework, we analyze the relationship
between multi-winner voting rules and their axiomatic performance under several
preference distributions. We then show that neural networks, acting as voting
rules, can outperform traditional rules in minimizing axiom violations. Our
results suggest that data-driven approaches to social choice can inform the
design of new voting systems and support the continuation of data-driven
research in social choice.
