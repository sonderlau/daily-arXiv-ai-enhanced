While their individual dynamics have been\nwidely studied, their coupled interactions, particularly in the context of ENSO\ncomplexity, including spatial diversity (Central Pacific vs. Eastern Pacific\nevents), temporal evolution (single-year and multi-year events), and intensity\nvariations (moderate to extreme events), have received limited attention in\nmodeling studies. In this paper, a simple intermediate coupled MJO-ENSO model\nis developed to address critical gaps in understanding their bidirectional\nfeedback and its role in modulating ENSO complexity. The model integrates\nmultiscale processes, bridging intraseasonal (MJO), interannual (ENSO), and\ndecadal (Walker circulation) variability. Key mechanisms include: (1)\ninterannual SST modulating MJO through latent heat and background states, (2)\nMJO-induced wind forcing triggering diverse ENSO events, and (3) decadal\nvariability modulating the strength and occurrence frequency of Eastern Pacific\nand Central Pacific events. Effective stochastic parameterizations are\nincorporated to improve the characterization of multiscale MJO-ENSO\ninteractions and the emergence of intermittency and extremes. The model\ncaptures several crucial observed MJO and ENSO features, including non-Gaussian\nstatistics, seasonal cycles, energy spectra, and spatial event patterns. It\nalso reproduces critical MJO-ENSO interactions: warm pool edge extension,\nconvective activity adjustments that modulate SST, and ENSO's dependence on\nMJO-driven easterly and westerly wind anomalies. The model provides a useful\ntool to analyze long-term variations. It also advances the understanding of\nENSO extreme events and their remote impacts, as well as seasonal forecasting\nand climate resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e2d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8026\u5408MJO-ENSO\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\u53ca\u5bf9ENSO\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "MJO\u548cENSO\u662f\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u7387\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8026\u5408\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728ENSO\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff08\u5982\u7a7a\u95f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MJO\u3001ENSO\u548cWalker\u73af\u6d41\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u6355\u6349\u4e86MJO\u548cENSO\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u5468\u671f\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u957f\u671f\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u7406\u89e3ENSO\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53ca\u5176\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u97e7\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Two factors in future climate\nprojections could alter this dilemma: (i) an increased ratio of CO$_2$ forcing\nrelative to aerosol cooling, owing to both continued accumulation of CO$_2$ and\ndeclining aerosol emissions, and (ii) a warming world, whereby CO$_2$-induced\nwarming becomes more pronounced relative to climate variability. Here, we\ndevelop a novel modeling approach to explore the rates of learning about\nequilibrium climate sensitivity and the transient climate response (TCR) and\nidentify the physical drivers underpinning these learning rates. Our approach\nhas the advantage over past work by accounting for the full spectrum of\nparameter uncertainties and covariances, while also taking into account\nserially correlated internal climate variability. Moreover, we provide a\nphysical explanation of how quickly we may hope to learn about climate\nsensitivity. We find that, although we are able to constrain future TCR\nregardless of the true underlying value, constraining ECS is more difficult,\nwith low values of ECS being more easily ascertained than high values. This\nasymmetry can be explained by most of the warming this century being\nattributable to the fast climate mode, which is more useful for constraining\nTCR than it is for ECS.

We validate our\nAPTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to 96.69\\%\ntest accuracy in just 20 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters.\nThe results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency\nof the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new\nparadigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.", "AI": {"tldr": "APTx Neuron\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7edf\u4e00\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5c06\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5c42\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u5197\u4f59\u3002APTx Neuron\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b80\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "APTx Neuron\u57fa\u4e8eAPTx\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3a$y = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\\alpha_i + \\tanh(\\beta_i x_i)) \\cdot \\gamma_i x_i) + \\delta$\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAPTx Neuron\u4ec5\u752820\u4e2aepoch\u548c\u7ea6332K\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u8fbe\u523096.69%\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "APTx Neuron\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

As large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated superior code generation abilities, recent MILP works are devoted\nto leveraging the evolutionary computation approaches with LLMs to generate\neffective primal heuristics.

However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound\nremains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane\nmovement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks\nover time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical\nand research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning\nand optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated\nframework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine\ndeep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking\nacross diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes\na graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality\ntraining data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a\nnovel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency\nframe-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack\ndemonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point\ntrackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its\npotential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical\nresearch. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:\ncardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis\nduring reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion.

However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive\ndomains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose\ncollaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries\nthe model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them\nchallenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this\nchallenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning\nmodel. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system \"Fail Fast, or Ask\",\nsince the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert\ndirectly (\"failing fast\"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher\nlatency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and\nabout 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the\naccuracy-rejection curve.

We further constructed\na Routine-following training dataset and fine-tuned Qwen3-14B, resulting in an\naccuracy increase to 88.2% on scenario-specific evaluations, indicating\nimproved adherence to execution plans. In addition, we employed Routine-based\ndistillation to create a scenario-specific, multi-step tool-calling dataset.\nFine-tuning on this distilled dataset raised the model's accuracy to 95.5%,\napproaching GPT-4o's performance. These results highlight Routine's\neffectiveness in distilling domain-specific tool-usage patterns and enhancing\nmodel adaptability to new scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that\nRoutine provides a practical and accessible approach to building stable agent\nworkflows, accelerating the deployment and adoption of agent systems in\nenterprise environments, and advancing the technical vision of AI for Process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRoutine\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f20\u9012\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6267\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u6df7\u4e71\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Routine\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6e05\u6670\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u660e\u786e\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4f01\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cRoutine\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5982GPT-4o\u4ece41.1%\u5347\u81f396.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "Routine\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2dAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

In DFQ, the quantization model must be\ncalibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic\nsamples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global\nand local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data\nquality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant\ndifference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the\nquantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance\ndegradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a\npipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).\nSpecifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,\neffectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and\ninference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the\nquantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the\nfull-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves\nremarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par\nwith models quantized through real data.

We apply this framework to two high-risk fields:\nmisinformation spread and e-commerce fraud. Our findings show that\ndecentralized systems are more effective at carrying out malicious actions than\ncentralized ones. The increased autonomy of decentralized systems allows them\nto adapt their strategies and cause more damage. Even when traditional\ninterventions, like content flagging, are applied, decentralized groups can\nadjust their tactics to avoid detection.

While ANNs have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in\nfacial expression recognition, their ability to model inter-individual\ndifferences in human perception remains underexplored. This study investigates\nthe phenomenon of high perceptual variability-where individuals exhibit\nsignificant differences in emotion categorization even when viewing the same\nstimulus. Inspired by the similarity between ANNs and human perception, we\nhypothesize that facial expression samples that are ambiguous for ANN\nclassifiers also elicit divergent perceptual judgments among human observers.\nTo examine this hypothesis, we introduce a novel perceptual boundary sampling\nmethod to generate facial expression stimuli that lie along ANN decision\nboundaries. These ambiguous samples form the basis of the varEmotion dataset,\nconstructed through large-scale human behavioral experiments.

Current 3D\nscene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding,\nparticularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles\nand interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and\npowerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects\nusing natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D\nembeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that\ncaptures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships.

Addressing these\nissues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed\nMS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving\nefficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction\nmechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch\ninherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information\nwith cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter\nbranch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain\ncross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing\nin SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing\nmultispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy\nboth functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive\nexperiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our\nMS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object\ndetection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general\nand applicable to other multispectral perception tasks.

This study\npresents a cost-effective computer vision framework that estimates plate-level\nfood waste by utilizing semantic segmentation of RGB images taken before and\nafter meal consumption across five Iranian dishes.

All models achieved satisfying performance, and for each food type, at\nleast one model approached or surpassed 90% DPA, demonstrating strong alignment\nin pixel-wise proportion estimates. Lighter models with reduced parameter\ncounts offered faster inference, achieving real-time throughput on an NVIDIA T4\nGPU. Further analysis showed superior segmentation performance for dry and more\nrigid components (e.g., rice and fries), while more complex, fragmented, or\nviscous dishes, such as stews, showed reduced performance, specifically\npost-consumption.

However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing\napproaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values,\nwhich becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments.\nSpecifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm,\nexacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of the\nenvironment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias in\nvalue functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternative\nmethods that bypass value function estimation. First, we adapt GRPO to\nride-sharing, replacing the PPO baseline with the group average reward to\neliminate critic estimation errors and reduce training bias.

In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a\nteacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot\nabilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation\nRecognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt\nDistillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal\nknowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to\nrecognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations.\nSpecifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental\nRationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze\nrationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed\nscene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align\nrationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the\nNegative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively\ncapturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned\nmultimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a\nstronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding,\nbridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction\nbias in rare cases.

Batching allows managers to trade off cost and\nprocessing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may\nlower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they\ncreate longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches\nreduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching\npolicy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each\nbatch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via\nsimulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization\nmeta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto\nfront of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three\nmeta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement\nlearning.

In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain\nvision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex\nchart reasoning.

Then we develop a two-stage training\nstrategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and\nChart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims\nto decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable\nsubtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for\nimproving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the\ntypical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft\nreward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity\nin the chart domain.

The emergence of large language\nmodel (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing\nLLM-based drama generation methods often result in AI agents that lack\ninitiative and cannot interact with the physical environment. Furthermore,\nthese methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These\nlimitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time\nperformance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent\nframework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple\ntopic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent\nimprovisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given\nan autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based\non their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to\nconversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of\nscene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.\nThe change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know\nand care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the\nquality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three\nprimary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and\ninteraction experience.

In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical\nExamination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we\ncompared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across\n60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality\nintake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the\noverseeing PCP to review.

EAMI first employs a dual-perspective\nthought track mechanism, where an Inspector Agent and an Analysis Agent extract\nagent intentions under bounded and perfect rationality. Then, k-means\nclustering identifies phase transition points in group intentions, followed by\na Intention Temporal Emergence diagram for dynamic analysis. The experiments\nvalidate EAMI in complex online-to-offline (O2O) service system and the\nStanford AI Town experiment, with ablation studies confirming its\neffectiveness, generalizability, and efficiency. This framework provides a\nnovel paradigm for abnormal emergence and causal analysis in service\necosystems.

Although\nprevious research has collected paired real-world hazy and haze-free images to\nimprove dehazing models' performance in real-world scenarios, these models\noften experience significant performance drops when handling unseen real-world\nhazy images due to limited training data. This issue motivates us to develop a\nflexible domain adaptation method to enhance dehazing performance during\ntesting.

This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on\ntemporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find\nthat larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference\npoint and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance\nlogarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To\nuncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses\nacross neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify\na set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits\nminimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a\nlogarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing\nrepresentations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where\nyears evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal\norientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we\nfound that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear\ntemporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal\nconstruction.

Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on\nseparate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D\npoint clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to\ntrain.

We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that\nleverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to\nestimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.\nWe express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit\nvector in the plane perpendicular to the axis.

To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary\ncomponents: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based\non an $\\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously\nestimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm\nand orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an\niterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane\ntranslations through a global least-squares formulation.

However, adapting these large-scale models to\ndownstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains\nchallenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer\nfrom two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality\nisolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations,\nwe propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that\nestablishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,\nenabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge\nflows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early\nlayers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts\nthrough a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of\nlow-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific\ntask-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper\nalignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations\nat multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain\ntransferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization.

Our experiments show that this unified training strategy not only\nsimplifies deployment but also significantly boosts generalization on\nfull-resolution data.

Our PanTiny\nmodel, benefiting from these innovations, achieves a superior\nperformance-to-efficiency balance, outperforming most larger, specialized\nmodels.

Although recent advances in multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon\nvisual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in\ntraining large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural\nannotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics\neffectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to\nexplicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when\ncompared to free-form, natural language.

To more explicitly model the structured\naction space unique to visual planning tasks, we leverage Multi-token\nPrediction, extending traditional next-token prediction by using multiple heads\nto predict multiple future tokens during training.

Semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the\nlabeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through\nself-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation\nmodels pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize\nacross domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images.

To address the\nshortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose\nConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation\nmodel using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable\npixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as\nsupervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage.

Despite notable\nadvances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human\ncapabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex\nscene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a\ncomprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,\nrealizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS).

To achieve robust and accurate performance\nin such scenarios, we propose DMD, a minutiae-anchored local dense\nrepresentation which captures both fine-grained ridge textures and\ndiscriminative minutiae features in a spatially structured manner.\nSpecifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and\noriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where\ntwo dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the\nthird encodes semantic features.

In\ntraining, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank\nfactorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.\nThese features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves\nshared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.\nSubsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI\nclass and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction\nrepresentations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight\nadaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show\nthat our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on\nHICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/ChelsieLei/HOLa.", "AI": {"tldr": "HOLa\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3VLM\u7279\u5f81\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672cHOI\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672cHOI\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u540c\u5bf9\u8c61\u52a8\u4f5c\u6216\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3VLM\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u53ef\u8c03\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u52a8\u4f5c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728HICO-DET\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523027.91\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u7c7bmAP\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u9886\u5148\u3002", "conclusion": "HOLa\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672cHOI\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

By contrasting the output\ndistributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and\npure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally\nincorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,\nEVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding\nstrategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on\nwidely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces\nhallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its\neffectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEVA\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u6291\u5236\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEVA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u89c9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u4ee5\u4fee\u6b63\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEVA\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "EVA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

To build a strong teacher\nmodel, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first\ntrain the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate\npseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are\nused in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to\ncombine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model\nthrough self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further\npseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.\nThe student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,\npseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled\nimages from the enhanced teacher model.

Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nis a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently\noccurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its\nimplementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be\nchallenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each\nmedical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image\nprocessing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that\ndynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation.

The regularizer could be viewed as a\npenalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find\ntask-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic\nfew-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA\nand then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base\norgans and novel organs.
