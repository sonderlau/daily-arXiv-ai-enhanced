This system, referred to as biological reservoir computing\n(BRC), replaces artificial recurrent units with the spontaneous and evoked\nactivity of living neurons. A multi-electrode array (MEA) enables simultaneous\nstimulation and readout across multiple sites: inputs are delivered through a\nsubset of electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting neural\nresponses, mapping input patterns into a high-dimensional biological feature\nspace. We evaluate the system through a case study on digit classification\nusing a custom dataset. Input images are encoded and delivered to the\nbiological reservoir via electrical stimulation, and the corresponding neural\nactivity is used to train a simple linear classifier. To contextualize the\nperformance of the biological system, we also include a comparison with a\nstandard artificial reservoir trained on the same task.

This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional\nsemantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and\nsource. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,\ninteroperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable\nfor dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is\nthen processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic\nannotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,\nincluding the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are\nproposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the\ninteroperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the\nsynonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the\ntransportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or\ncloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,\nBluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is\nproposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,\nDempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)\nis proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor\nIoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred.

While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction,\nAI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation.\nDrawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to\ninvestigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings\nprovide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents\ncollaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants\nshift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and\ninterpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when\nsocial context is introduced.

To train on-policy in live environments, we propose\nFlow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles\nlong-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn\noptimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It\nbroadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align\nlocal planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with\ngroup-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale\nbackbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of\n14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on\nscientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.\nFurther analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing\nimproved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with\nmodel size and reasoning turns."}

This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but\nundermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering\nits ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,\nconsistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the\nlevel-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a\ncoarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at\nlow resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher\nscales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization\naligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of\npoint sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed\norderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the\nautoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based\nbaselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense\ngeneration with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more\npronounced, underscoring its scalability potential."}

Specifically, video generation models are\nnow being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.\nSimultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined\nalternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining\npopularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of\nthese techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,\nwhile video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can\nthese videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic\nenough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is\ncrucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper\ninsights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to\nout-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the\ndriving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these\nquestions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to\nevaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of\nthe video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate\ndistribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance.

The\ndataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from\ndocumented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and\nSeptember 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.\nWe estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing\none-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional\nsize cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our\nresults show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure\nhailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm\nfor the best model.

To address the lack of 3D hand\nannotations in diverse settings, we design an annotation pipeline consisting of\na diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion. For the\nforecasting model, we adopt a diffusion loss to account for the multimodality\nin hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the\nbenefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and\neffectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models,\nover the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday\nimages."}

To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual\nquestion answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the\nintroduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation\nquality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between\nlighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered\nby Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are\nvisually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct\nEgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and\nrefinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked\nby annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs\nacross 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of\nhuman work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to\nnight, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.\nBeyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night\ncorrespondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further\nexplore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a\nstrong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research\nand for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the\ndata and code will be made available upon acceptance."}
