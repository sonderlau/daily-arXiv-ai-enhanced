Consequently, our benchmark\ntests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict\nresolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven\ndesign and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid\nscenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce\npertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the\neffectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments\nacross SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory\nacross long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving\ncontradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\\%\nCorrectness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for\nadvancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing\nfocus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,\nmulti-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings"}

Some\nrecent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and\nperform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D\nscene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations\nfor robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to\ndecouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and\nreconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this\nend, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based\non a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent\nimages into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion\nmodel to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D\nscenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view\ndegradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from\nlarge-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image\ninconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of\nour method in robust reconstruction.

Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,\nsuch as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper\ninvestigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological\ncounseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a\npsychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the\nqualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.\nNational Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human\ncounselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate\nsufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a\nrole. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in\nU.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional\ncounselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises\napproximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to\nrequire deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of\npsychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's\nability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models\nsuch as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing\nthreshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)\nremain far below it.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end\nframework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and\ngeometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and\nindependent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic\nConvolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to\nguide generalizable matching.

To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising\nperformance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling\nresearchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language\nqueries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it\nremoves technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge\ngraphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while\nmaintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs\nremain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This\napproach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between\ncomplex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.

Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,\nsensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the\nholistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the\npossibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal\nmodalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of\nhealth monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled\ndatasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and\nmodalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a\npromising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support\nmodel training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on\nknowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside\nstudent model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.\nThis challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation\nmodels that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at\nthe cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for\nunsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a\nlightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable\ninformation flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,\nwe introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the\nbridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the\nbridge architecture.

We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method\nthat scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among\nthem using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables\nboth wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially\nimproving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method\nestablishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming\nprior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with\ncomprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate\nstrong generalization results to different operating systems on\nWindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the\nunreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective\nscaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN\nprovides a practical framework to achieve this."}

High-resolution text-to-image generators are\ncurrently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative\nto their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key\ntechnical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this\nlimitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across\nresolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal\nfrom lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a\ntrain-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that\nrecalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.\nNoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and\nis compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable\nDiffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly\nimproved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and\nFlux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by\n10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent\nartifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation."}
