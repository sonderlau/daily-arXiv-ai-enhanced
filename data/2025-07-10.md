### [1] [Explaining Surface Layer Theory Departures in Marine Flux Profiles with Data-Driven Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06425)
*Jack Foxabbott,Leo Mckee-Reid,Andrew Cusick,Robbie McCorkell,Jugal Patel,Jamie Rumbelow,Jessica Rumbelow,Zohreh Shams,Arush Tagade,Patrick Hawbecker,Sue Ellen Haupt*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 研究发现Monin--Obukhov相似理论（MOST）在海岸海洋环境中常不适用，风速和热通量垂直分布异常，揭示了三种导致MOST假设失效的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证MOST在海岸环境中的适用性，发现其假设在复杂条件下常不成立。

Method: 利用CLASI项目的ASIS浮标测量风速和通量数据，结合Discovery Engine自动分析工具识别异常模式。

Result: 20%观测中风速随高度递减，热通量垂直梯度大，三种机制导致MOST失效：边界层、风浪驱动和热稳定条件。

Conclusion: MOST在海岸环境中局限性明显，需改进通量算法以适应复杂条件。

Abstract: Monin--Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), which underpins nearly all bulk
estimates of surface fluxes in the atmospheric surface layer, assumes monotonic
wind profiles and vertically uniform momentum and heat fluxes. Here, we show
that conditions frequently arise in coastal marine settings where these
assumptions do not hold. Using flux measurements from the Coastal Land-Air-Sea
Interaction (CLASI) project's Air-Sea Interaction Spar (ASIS) buoys with wind
and flux measurements at typically ~3m and ~5m above the sea surface, we find
that wind speed decreases with height in nearly 20% of observations, and that
large vertical gradients in sensible heat flux occur near the surface, contrary
to what would be predicted by MOST. Both anomalies are strongly modulated by
coastal proximity and wind direction, with the highest occurrence rates near
shore under offshore winds. These patterns were found using the Discovery
Engine, a general-purpose automated system for scientific discovery, which
identifies complex relationships in data without prior hypotheses. The
Discovery Engine uncovered three distinct mechanisms responsible for breakdowns
in MOST assumptions: internal boundary layers formed by offshore continental
flow, wave-driven wind jets associated with high wave age, and thermally stable
boundary layers over cold sea surfaces where warm, moist air overlies cooler
water far from shore. These findings highlight the limitations of current flux
algorithms and suggest directions for improved parameterisation in coastal and
open-ocean conditions.

### [2] [Generative Lagrangian data assimilation for ocean dynamics under extreme sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06479)
*Niloofar Asefi,Leonard Lupin-Jimenez,Tianning Wu,Ruoying He,Ashesh Chattopadhyay*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合神经算子和去噪扩散概率模型（DDPMs）的深度学习框架，用于从极稀疏的拉格朗日观测数据中重建高分辨率海洋状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于海洋观测数据的稀疏性、不规则性和拉格朗日特性，传统的数据同化方法和深度学习模型难以恢复中尺度湍流，限制了关键现象（如涡旋脱落和异常波）的预测能力。

Method: 通过将生成模型与神经算子输出相结合，该框架能够在99%（合成数据）和99.9%（真实卫星数据）的稀疏条件下准确捕捉小尺度、高波数动态。

Result: 在基准系统、合成浮标观测和真实卫星数据上的验证表明，该方法在严重空间采样限制下表现优于其他深度学习基线。

Conclusion: 该框架为从稀疏观测数据中重建海洋动态提供了一种有效解决方案，尤其在极端稀疏条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Reconstructing ocean dynamics from observational data is fundamentally
limited by the sparse, irregular, and Lagrangian nature of spatial sampling,
particularly in subsurface and remote regions. This sparsity poses significant
challenges for forecasting key phenomena such as eddy shedding and rogue waves.
Traditional data assimilation methods and deep learning models often struggle
to recover mesoscale turbulence under such constraints. We leverage a deep
learning framework that combines neural operators with denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) to reconstruct high-resolution ocean states from
extremely sparse Lagrangian observations. By conditioning the generative model
on neural operator outputs, the framework accurately captures small-scale,
high-wavenumber dynamics even at $99\%$ sparsity (for synthetic data) and
$99.9\%$ sparsity (for real satellite observations). We validate our method on
benchmark systems, synthetic float observations, and real satellite data,
demonstrating robust performance under severe spatial sampling limitations as
compared to other deep learning baselines.

### [3] [Downscaling with AI reveals the large role of internal variability in fine-scale projections of climate extremes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06527)
*Neelesh Rampal,Peter B. Gibson,Steven C. Sherwood,Laura E. Queen,Hamish Lewis,Gab Abramowitz*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种生成式AI方法，用于扩展区域降尺度的范围，解决了传统方法无法处理的罕见极端事件问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动力降尺度的计算成本限制了集合规模，难以表征罕见极端事件。

Method: 开发了一种新的生成式AI方法，应用于新西兰地区，测试其对未来降水和温度极端事件的预测能力。

Result: 未来降水和温度的极端事件在精细尺度上更平滑且局部变化较小；罕见极端事件（如10年和20年一遇）的变化更严重且内部变异性更大。

Conclusion: 精细尺度下的未来降水变化比普遍认为的更不可预测，需要更大的集合规模来可靠评估。

Abstract: The computational cost of dynamical downscaling limits ensemble sizes in
regional downscaling efforts. We present a newly developed generative-AI
approach to greatly expand the scope of such downscaling, enabling fine-scale
future changes to be characterised including rare extremes that cannot be
addressed by traditional approaches. We test this approach for New Zealand,
where strong regional effects are anticipated. At fine scales, the forced
(predictable) component of precipitation and temperature extremes for future
periods (2080--2099) is spatially smoother than changes in individual
simulations, and locally smaller. Future changes in rarer (10-year and 20-year)
precipitation extremes are more severe and have larger internal variability
spread than annual extremes. Internal variability spread is larger at fine
scales that at the coarser scales simulated in climate models. Unpredictability
from internal variability dominates model uncertainty and, for precipitation,
its variance increases with warming, exceeding the variance across emission
scenarios by fourfold for annual and tenfold for decadal extremes. These
results indicate that fine-scale changes in future precipitation are less
predictable than widely assumed and require much larger ensembles to assess
reliably than changes at coarser scales.

### [4] [Temperature induced tipping in a two box ocean circulation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07078)
*Jasmine Noory*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了气候系统中的临界点，特别是大西洋经向翻转环流（AMOC）的温度梯度作为强迫参数时的临界点现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于持续增加的全球能量吸收，研究AMOC模型中的热力学动态变得重要。

Method: 使用Paola Cessi（1994）提出的双箱模型，分析温度梯度作为强迫参数时的临界点。

Result: 研究发现，温度梯度可以作为强迫参数导致AMOC的临界点现象。

Conclusion: 温度梯度在AMOC模型中同样能引发临界点现象，扩展了对气候系统临界点的理解。

Abstract: Climate tipping points are critical thresholds in Earth's climate system
where a small change can cause abrupt and potentially irreversible shifts
towards a new state. Tipping points in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation (AMOC) are of much scientific concern because of the large-scale
impacts on Earth's climate. A two-box model representing the AMOC, introduced
by oceanographer Paola Cessi (1994), revealed a multistable system, and was
used to develop a tipping analysis framework to capture critical thresholds
under freshwater forcing. Sustained increases in planetary energy uptake
motivate the inspection of the model, shifting the focus to thermal dynamics.
In this paper, we demonstrate that tipping can occur in the model where the
temperature gradient acts as the forcing parameter instead of the freshwater
forcing parameter.

### [5] [Unveiling the Underwater World: CLIP Perception Model-Guided Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06234)
*Jiangzhong Cao,Zekai Zeng,Xu Zhang,Huan Zhang,Chunling Fan,Gangyi Jiang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CLIP感知损失模块和课程对比正则化的水下图像增强方法，以提升感知质量和内容恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像质量受光吸收和散射影响，现有深度学习方法忽视人类感知且缺乏解空间约束，导致增强图像感知质量下降或内容恢复不佳。

Method: 利用CLIP模型的视觉语义特征提取能力，设计感知损失模块和课程对比正则化，优化增强网络的感知质量和约束。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和泛化能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合CLIP感知和课程对比正则化能有效提升水下图像增强的感知质量和内容恢复效果。

Abstract: High-quality underwater images are essential for both machine vision tasks
and viewers with their aesthetic appeal.However, the quality of underwater
images is severely affected by light absorption and scattering. Deep
learning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved
good performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human
perception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.
Consequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual
quality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE
method with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss
module and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a
perception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual
perception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model
is leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the
quality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated
as a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the
perceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model
is integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the
constraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,
mitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.
Specifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize
the learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,
ensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and
negatives with varied quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and
generalization ability.

### [6] [SPARC: Concept-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders for Cross-Model and Cross-Modal Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06265)
*Ali Nasiri-Sarvi,Hassan Rivaz,Mahdi S. Hosseini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARC框架通过全局TopK稀疏机制和跨重建损失，为不同AI模型创建统一的概念空间，显著提升跨模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法因模型独立表示导致的概念空间不兼容问题，实现跨模型和跨模态的概念对齐。

Method: 引入SPARC框架，结合全局TopK稀疏机制和跨重建损失，强制不同模型共享统一的概念空间。

Result: 在Open Images数据集上，SPARC将概念对齐的Jaccard相似度提升至0.80，远超现有方法。

Conclusion: SPARC不仅实现了跨模型的概念对齐，还支持文本引导的空间定位和跨模型检索等应用。

Abstract: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts,
such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically
produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods
like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each
model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model
interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for
Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,
unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,
vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is
enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,
ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given
concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages
semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically
improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than
tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared
sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar
high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of
how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring
manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned
representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided
spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal
retrieval. Code and models are available at
https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/SPARC.

### [7] [A Probabilistic Approach to Uncertainty Quantification Leveraging 3D Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06269)
*Rushil Desai,Frederik Warburg,Trevor Darrell,Marissa Ramirez de Chanlatte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesSDF是一种新的概率框架，用于量化神经隐式SDF模型中的不确定性，解决了现有方法的计算效率低和几何不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学模拟应用（如森林中的流体流动）需要精确的表面几何和不确定性量化，现有方法缺乏几何整合。

Method: 利用Laplace近似和Hessian度量，实现高效、表面感知的不确定性估计。

Result: BayesSDF在合成和真实数据集上表现优于现有方法，提供了可操作的不确定性度量。

Conclusion: BayesSDF为不确定性感知的3D场景重建、模拟和机器人决策提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly
those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial
challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and
geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric
integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce
BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in
neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications
with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through
forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface
geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF
or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define
continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical
modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify
local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally
efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that
uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry,
providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF
outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency,
establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction,
simulation, and robotic decision-making.

### [8] [LIRA: Inferring Segmentation in Large Multi-modal Models with Local Interleaved Region Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06272)
*Zhang Li,Biao Yang,Qiang Liu,Shuo Zhang,Zhiyin Ma,Shuo Zhang,Liang Yin,Linger Deng,Yabo Sun,Yuliang Liu,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIRA框架通过结合语义增强特征提取器和交错局部视觉耦合，解决了多模态模型在分割和视觉理解中的不准确和幻觉问题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在分割和理解任务中存在不准确分割和幻觉理解的局限性，主要源于视觉理解能力弱和缺乏细粒度感知。

Method: 提出LIRA框架，包含语义增强特征提取器（SEFE）和交错局部视觉耦合（ILVC），分别提升分割准确性和减少幻觉理解。

Result: LIRA在分割和理解任务中达到最先进性能，并通过AttrEval数据集量化了分割精度与语义推断能力的关系。

Conclusion: LIRA通过结合语义和局部特征，显著提升了多模态模型的分割和理解能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in
segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations:
inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem
primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of
fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a
framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual
comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced
Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic
and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2)
Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local
descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks,
offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we
find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with
the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. To quantify this relationship
and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the
Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension
tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

TL;DR: 该论文综述了离线手写文本识别（HTR）中的数据增强与生成技术，探讨了传统方法与深度学习方法（如GANs、扩散模型和基于Transformer的方法），并分析了生成多样且真实手写样本的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线HTR系统在历史文档数字化等领域至关重要，但标注数据稀缺限制了其性能，尤其是对低资源语言和复杂脚本。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法，系统筛选了1,302项研究，最终纳入848项，评估了传统和深度学习方法。

Result: 分析了现有数据集、评估指标和先进方法，揭示了研究空白。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，以推动手写文本生成在多语言和风格场景中的发展。

Abstract: Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems play a crucial role in
applications such as historical document digitization, automatic form
processing, and biometric authentication. However, their performance is often
hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data, particularly
for low-resource languages and complex scripts. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of offline handwritten data augmentation and generation
techniques designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of HTR systems. We
systematically examine traditional augmentation methods alongside recent
advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, we explore the
challenges associated with generating diverse and realistic handwriting
samples, particularly in preserving script authenticity and addressing data
scarcity. This survey follows the PRISMA methodology, ensuring a structured and
rigorous selection process. Our analysis began with 1,302 primary studies,
which were filtered down to 848 after removing duplicates, drawing from key
academic sources such as IEEE Digital Library, Springer Link, Science Direct,
and ACM Digital Library. By evaluating existing datasets, assessment metrics,
and state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey identifies key research gaps
and proposes future directions to advance the field of handwritten text
generation across diverse linguistic and stylistic landscapes.

*Joon Tai Kim,Tianle Chen,Ziyu Dong,Nishanth Kunchala,Alexander Guller,Daniel Ospina Acero,Roger Williams,Mrinal Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CCPDA的数据增强方法，用于改善野火科学中的多类分割模型训练，特别针对火类分割性能的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标注图像成本高且公开数据集稀缺，野火科学领域缺乏可靠的标注数据，影响了分割模型的训练效果。

Method: CCPDA方法包括三步：(i)识别源图像中的火簇，(ii)通过中心化技术聚焦火区核心，(iii)将处理后的火簇粘贴到目标图像上。

Result: CCPDA通过数值分析和多目标优化比较，显著提升了火类分割性能，优于其他增强方法。

Conclusion: CCPDA有效缓解了小规模标注数据集的训练难题，尤其在火类分割中表现出色。

Abstract: Collecting and annotating images for the purpose of training segmentation
models is often cost prohibitive. In the domain of wildland fire science, this
challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets
with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data
Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of
deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving
segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)
identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization
technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined
fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity
while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The
effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical
analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a
weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps
elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which
carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,
ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of
the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with
small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA
outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario
considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.

*Fuyuan Zhang,Qichen Wang,Jianjun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR2通过对齐干净和损坏图像的类激活图（CAMs），提升预训练CNN的鲁棒性，无需改变架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在常见损坏（如噪声、模糊等）下性能下降，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: AR2采用CAM对齐和迭代修复策略，结合CAM引导的细化和标准微调。

Result: AR2在CIFAR-10-C等标准损坏基准上优于现有方法，平衡了干净数据和损坏数据的准确性。

Conclusion: AR2为增强模型在多样化损坏环境中的可靠性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when
exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital
distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this
paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet
effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2
operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean
and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention
even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair
strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard
fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments
show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
restoring robustness on standard corruption benchmarks (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C
and ImageNet-C), achieving a favorable balance between accuracy on clean data
and corruption robustness. These results demonstrate that AR2 provides a robust
and scalable solution for enhancing model reliability in real-world
environments with diverse corruptions.

15 diverse video sequences with 408,578 meticulously annotated bounding boxes
across 48,066 frames. Our dataset captures various underwater environments,
fish species, and challenging conditions including occlusions, similar
appearances, and erratic motion patterns. Additionally, we introduce
Scale-aware and Unscented Tracker (SU-T), a specialized tracking framework

revealing fundamental differences between fish tracking and terrestrial object
tracking scenarios. MFT25 establishes a robust foundation for advancing
research in underwater tracking systems with important applications in marine
biology, aquaculture monitoring, and ecological conservation. The dataset and

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for
applications in healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction.
Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture
but remains underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. We introduce
SImpHAR, a novel framework addressing this limitation through two core
contributions. First, we propose a simulation pipeline that generates realistic
bio-impedance signals from 3D human meshes using shortest-path estimation,
soft-body physics, and text-to-motion generation serving as a digital twin for
data augmentation. Second, we design a two-stage training strategy with
decoupled approach that enables broader activity coverage without requiring
label-aligned synthetic data. We evaluate SImpHAR on our collected ImpAct
dataset and two public benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 22.3% and 21.8%, in terms of
accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively. Our results highlight the promise of
simulation-driven augmentation and modular training for impedance-based HAR.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在新对象或陌生环境中的泛化能力有限，且附加组件增加了计算开销，需要高效且独立的方法。

Method: 提出无标记器微调方法并行预测动作，结合集成投票策略优化动作采样。

Result: 实验显示，VOTE在性能上达到最优，推理速度提升35倍，吞吐量达145 Hz。

Conclusion: VOTE是一种高效且通用的VLA模型优化框架，显著提升了速度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Result: 在THUMOS14、ActivityNet-1.3和HACS数据集上分别提升了2.8%、1.2%和4.8%。

Conclusion: PCL-Former在时序动作定位任务中表现出色，验证了多阶段Transformer架构的有效性。

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of transformers and multi-stage architectures
in video recognition and object detection domains. We thoroughly explore the
rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage
architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This
exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer
architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated
transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the
Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may
contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories
within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the
temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate
the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three
challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments.
We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each
individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art
TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS
datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: THOR是一种实时自适应时空RGB帧采样方法，利用热感技术捕捉手部活动，显著减少数据量和计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可穿戴相机连续处理RGB图像的高功耗、大数据量、隐私问题和计算资源需求。

Method: 结合低分辨率热感数据动态调整RGB帧采样率，并利用热感线索定位感兴趣区域。

Result: 仅使用3%的原始RGB数据，实现了与完整视频相当的识别准确率（F1-score 95%）。

Conclusion: THOR为实时监测手部活动和健康风险行为提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Wearable cameras are increasingly used as an observational and interventional
tool for human behaviors by providing detailed visual data of hand-related
activities. This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging
of behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However,
continuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant
power impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video
data for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial
computational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time
adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal
sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use
low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches
from one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling
rate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during
periods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the
hand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in
each RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part
of the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate
our method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30
activities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9
countries, totaling 3,670 hours of video). Our results show that using only 3%
of the original RGB video data, our method captures all the activity segments,
and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to
using the entire RGB video (94%). Our work provides a more practical path for
the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and
health-risk behaviors in real time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件相机的自动编码器架构，用于高效压缩和重构事件数据，提升动态环境中的物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧式视觉系统存在运动模糊、高延迟和冗余数据处理问题，事件相机虽能捕捉异步亮度变化，但稀疏和噪声事件流对物体检测构成挑战。

Method: 采用卷积编码的自编码器架构，结合自适应阈值选择和轻量级分类器，以降低计算复杂度并提高识别精度。

Result: 在SEFD数据集上，模型精度与YOLO-v4相当，但参数减少35.5倍；在嵌入式平台上实现8-44.8 FPS的高帧率。

Conclusion: 该模型显著提升事件相机的视觉性能，适用于低功耗、高速的边缘计算应用。

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in
applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency,
and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic
environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at
the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object
detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an
event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs
event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The
proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive
threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition
accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the
existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$
fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi
4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8
FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the
state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance,
making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge
computing.

TL;DR: Video-RTS通过结合数据高效的强化学习和视频自适应测试时间缩放策略，显著提升了视频推理能力，减少了数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习和大型语言模型的视频推理方法依赖大规模监督微调和长链思维标注，成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 跳过资源密集的监督微调步骤，采用纯强化学习训练和稀疏到密集的视频测试时间缩放策略。

Result: 在多个视频推理基准测试中，Video-RTS仅用3.6%的训练样本就平均提升了2.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: Video-RTS通过纯强化学习和自适应视频测试时间缩放的互补优势，实现了强大的推理性能。

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with
large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant
challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,
making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a
new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved
data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time
scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL
samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL
training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or
extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more
efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves
inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate
our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS
surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy
using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%
improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning
benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and
adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong
reasoning performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Mask6D的新型预训练策略，通过结合2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图，提升了单目RGB图像在复杂或遮挡条件下的6D物体姿态估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前姿态估计网络在2D特征提取上表现不足，尤其是在目标被遮挡或场景杂乱时，RGB信息有限。

Method: 引入2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图作为额外模态信息，结合RGB图像进行基于重建的模型预训练，并设计了专注于物体的预训练损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有的端到端姿态估计方法。

Conclusion: Mask6D通过预训练策略显著提升了姿态估计的鲁棒性，尤其在复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using
monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current
pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware
features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB
information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate
this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named
Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and
visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB
images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D
correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the
pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the
integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard
cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training
loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the
background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware
network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose
prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous
end-to-end pose estimation methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双边协作框架（BC-HOI），通过注意力偏差引导（ABG）和基于大语言模型的监督引导（LSG），解决了开放词汇人-物交互检测中视觉特征粗粒度的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉语言模型（VLM）生成的粗粒度特征，与检测任务需求不符，需改进以生成细粒度特征。

Method: BC-HOI框架包含ABG（引导VLM生成细粒度特征）和LSG（利用LLM提供细粒度监督），提升交互表示能力。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中表现优异，开放和封闭场景均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BC-HOI通过双边协作有效提升开放词汇HOI检测性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Open vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging
task that detects all <human, verb, object> triplets of interest in an image,
even those that are not pre-defined in the training set. Existing approaches
typically rely on output features generated by large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to enhance the generalization ability of interaction representations.
However, the visual features produced by VLMs are holistic and coarse-grained,
which contradicts the nature of detection tasks. To address this issue, we
propose a novel Bilateral Collaboration framework for open vocabulary HOI
detection (BC-HOI). This framework includes an Attention Bias Guidance (ABG)
component, which guides the VLM to produce fine-grained instance-level
interaction features according to the attention bias provided by the HOI
detector. It also includes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Supervision
Guidance (LSG) component, which provides fine-grained token-level supervision
for the HOI detector by the LLM component of the VLM. LSG enhances the ability
of ABG to generate high-quality attention bias. We conduct extensive
experiments on two popular benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO, consistently
achieving superior performance in the open vocabulary and closed settings. The
code will be released in Github.

facilitate the use of these improvements for road safety, this survey
systematically categorizes the critical elements that demand attention in

aim of providing information on standards unification and resource
optimization. Our article concludes with a systematic discussion of the
existing weaknesses, underlining the potential effects and promising solutions
from various perspectives. The integrated taxonomy, comprehensive analysis, and

Conclusion: FIFA为评估和修正视频多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks. However, they often
suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual
input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also
fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address
this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that
extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies
via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using
VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction
framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation
methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in
both text and video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念遗忘方法在平衡遗忘效果与生成能力保留方面存在不足，导致扩散模型的安全风险难以有效解决。

Method: KSCU方法利用扩散模型的逐步采样特性，专注于对最终结果影响最大的关键步骤，仅在这些步骤上微调模型。

Result: 实验表明，KSCU能有效防止生成不良图像，同时更好地保留模型的生成能力。

Conclusion: KSCU是一种创新的概念遗忘方法，为扩散模型的安全使用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion,
which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely
used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing
concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to
balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this
limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU)
method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling
characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation
process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally,
KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the
final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and
fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the
number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing
the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive
benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs
from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's
generative capabilities.Our code will be released.

Motivation: 当前的自监督学习方法在数字病理学中可能忽略复杂的领域特定特征，且数据效率较低。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了EXAONE Path 2.0。

Method: EXAONE Path 2.0通过直接使用切片级监督学习补丁级表示，避免了自监督学习的局限性。

Result: 仅使用37k全切片图像训练，EXAONE Path 2.0在10种生物标志物预测任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EXAONE Path 2.0展示了显著的数据效率和性能提升，为数字病理学提供了一种更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle
due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via
self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings
via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks.
However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are
essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular
characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for
natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain
less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive
computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To
address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation
model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level
supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves
state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks,
demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

Motivation: 解决将英语口语转换为手语动画的挑战，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用Whisper进行语音转文本，MarianMT翻译为ASL gloss，结合Word2Vec和FastText优化翻译，基于Sign3D-WLASL数据集生成3D动画。

Result: 系统表现良好，BLEU分数达0.7714和0.8923，生成自然连续的手语动画。

Conclusion: 该框架整合音频、文本和动作，实现了从英语口语到逼真3D手语动画的完整转换。

Abstract: Helping deaf and hard-of-hearing people communicate more easily is the main
goal of Automatic Sign Language Translation. Although most past research has
focused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken
English into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's
because it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating
it into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this
work, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into
smooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper
to translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine
translation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)
gloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without
grammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.
To make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such
as Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the
translated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on
Sign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key
points from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss
translation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which
turns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss
using grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly
interpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike
previous works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use
only one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in
a single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D
sign language animation.

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval
for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods
focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However,
the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application,
which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called
CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims
to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the
application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a
simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)
to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified
similarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent
Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏显式的时空交互协调，且固定锚点策略难以适应不同未来环境，受人类驾驶行为启发，提出动态调整预测的方法。

Result: 在INTERACTION和Argoverse数据集上达到最优性能，交互场景中表现更准确且参数更少。

Conclusion: ILNet通过动态建模交互和锚点选择，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial
challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently
factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static
and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,
capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the
modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a
fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different
future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust
initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of
surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes
ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)
attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an
inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,
introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal
coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture
complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to
extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost
no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion
forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet
achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over
fewer parameters. Our codes are available at https://github.com/mjZeng11/ILNet.

Conclusion: 该工作不仅提供了新的SOTA模型，还为工业AI研究提供了宝贵的数据资源。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains,
ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in
high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the
absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling
and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold
contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset
(CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor
wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL
provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process
modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose
DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed
for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal
context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a
diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance
fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation.
Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly
outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and
improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988.
This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our
work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more
importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive
future research in industrial AI.

machine learning. Active learning offers a promising solution by allowing
machine learning models to be effectively trained with optimal data including
the most informative samples from large datasets. Wildlife data captured by
camera traps are excessive in volume, requiring tremendous effort in data
labelling and animal detection models training. Therefore, applying active
learning to optimise the amount of labelled data would be a great aid in
enabling automated wildlife monitoring and conservation. However, existing
active learning techniques require that a machine learning model (i.e., an
object detector) be fully accessible, limiting the applicability of the
techniques. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic active learning approach
for detection of animals captured by camera traps. Our approach integrates
uncertainty and diversity quantities of samples at both the object-based and
image-based levels into the active learning sample selection process. We
validate our approach in a benchmark animal dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that, using only 30% of the training data selected by our approach,
a state-of-the-art animal detector can achieve a performance of equal or
greater than that with the use of the complete training dataset.

TL;DR: FOLC-Net框架通过轻量级联邦优化架构提升MRI多视角诊断性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有SOTA模型在处理MRI多视角数据时性能下降的问题。

Method: 引入FOLC-Net，结合MRFO优化、全局模型克隆和ConvNeXt，参数仅1.217M，存储0.9MB。

Result: 在矢状面达到92.44%准确率，优于现有方法，且各视角性能均提升。

Conclusion: FOLC-Net为分散式医疗图像分析提供了更可靠、适应性更强的解决方案。

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined
as well as single anatomical perspectives for MRI disease diagnosis. It
specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal
anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which
incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with
approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9
MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for
efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable
training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was
evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as
axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical
imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different
data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The
results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the
challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of
92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of
study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally,
FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing
a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized
environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by
providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views
while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation
of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs
better in real-world medical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景的紧凑和时间感知表示对视觉跟踪和机器人操作等任务至关重要。

Method: ToBo通过压缩步骤将参考场景编码为瓶颈令牌，在扩展步骤中利用少量目标补丁预测目标场景。

Result: 在视频标签传播和机器人操作等任务中表现优于基线，并在真实环境中验证了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ToBo能有效学习动态场景表示，具有可扩展性和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Deriving compact and temporally aware visual representations from dynamic
scenes is essential for successful execution of sequential scene understanding
tasks such as visual tracking and robotic manipulation. In this paper, we
introduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised
learning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts
the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline
facilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively
encoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze
step. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by
predicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target
patches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal
dependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across
scenes. Extensive experiments in diverse sequential tasks, including video
label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments demonstrate
the superiority of ToBo over baselines. Moreover, deploying our pre-trained
model on physical robots confirms its robustness and effectiveness in
real-world environments. We further validate the scalability of ToBo across
different model scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音-视觉内容一对多映射的挑战，以及缺乏大规模公开数据集和高计算需求的问题。

Method: 利用2D骨架作为桥梁，结合细粒度音频分段和参考图像骨架，通过扩散模型预测骨骼运动，再输入现有人体视频生成模型。

Result: 在视觉质量和同步性上超越现有方法，并能泛化到不同说话人和场景。

Conclusion: 提出的框架高效且通用，结合公开数据集推动了该领域研究。

Abstract: Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic,
audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions
and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant
one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by
the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We
propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an
efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our
approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio
segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image,
predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure
strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons
are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the
speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize
research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of
high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and
diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while
generalizing across speakers and contexts.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现优异，但其广泛使用引发了版权和模型透明度的担忧。现有方法无法精确识别训练数据对图像中特定元素（如风格或对象）的影响。

Method: Concept-TRAK扩展了影响函数，通过两种创新实现概念级归因：1）基于扩散后验采样的训练损失函数；2）强调语义相关性的概念感知奖励函数。

Result: 在AbC基准测试中，Concept-TRAK显著优于现有方法，并通过案例研究展示了其在识别受保护内容、分析提示工程等方面的实用性。

Conclusion: Concept-TRAK为生成式AI的负责任开发和治理提供了可操作的见解，解决了现有归因方法的局限性。

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption
raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency.
Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire
image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as
styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called
\emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key
innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion
posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a
concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate
Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior
methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected
and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional
learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable
insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散和自回归视频生成模型缺乏物理对齐，无法准确模拟真实世界物体运动。

Method: 通过提取运动轨迹、检索预训练增强符号回归，发现运动方程以预测物理准确的轨迹，并引导视频生成。

Result: 在经典力学场景中成功恢复真实运动方程，生成视频的物理对齐优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架无需微调现有模型即可提升视频生成的物理准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models
have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack
accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object
motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned
statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical
laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates
symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for
physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories
from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance
symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically
accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation
without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in
Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions,
our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves
the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要捕捉成对关系，未能建模所有视图的联合结构。

Method: 提出DSF，将多视图表示为分布并计算分布间的差异。

Result: DSF在kNN分类和线性评估等任务中表现优异，且效率更高。

Conclusion: DSF无需温度超参数即可有效工作，且理论证明其与余弦相似性相关。

Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more
effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior
methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily
capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all
views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF)
that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of
augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence
between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently
improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and
linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other
multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between
DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF
operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

TL;DR: IAP是一种新型对抗性补丁攻击框架，通过感知感知定位和扰动优化方案生成高度不可见的对抗性补丁，显著提升攻击成功率和隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性补丁方法在目标攻击场景中表现不佳或缺乏上下文一致性，容易被人类或自动防御系统检测到。

Method: IAP结合类定位和敏感性地图选择补丁位置，并通过感知正则化对抗损失和梯度更新规则优化不可见扰动。

Result: IAP在多种图像基准和模型架构中实现高攻击成功率，同时显著提升补丁的不可见性，并能绕过现有防御系统。

Conclusion: IAP在目标攻击中表现出色，兼具高隐蔽性和有效性，为对抗性补丁研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite modifying only a small localized input region, adversarial patches
can drastically change the prediction of computer vision models. However, prior
methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or
fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be
easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against
automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack
framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on
perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.
Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by
leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the
susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human
visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a
gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible
perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and
model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive
attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch
invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly
imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several
state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的损失函数EBT，通过将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，显著提升了边缘检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WBCE损失函数对所有非边缘像素一视同仁，忽略了边缘附近的结构差异，导致预测模糊。

Method: 提出EBT损失函数，将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，并为每类分配不同的监督权重。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，EBT损失函数在定量和感知上均优于WBCE，且超参数设置简单。

Conclusion: EBT损失函数易于部署，性能优越，且对超参数变化鲁棒。

Abstract: Edge detection (ED) remains a fundamental task in computer vision, yet its
performance is often hindered by the ambiguous nature of non-edge pixels near
object boundaries. The widely adopted Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss
treats all non-edge pixels uniformly, overlooking the structural nuances around
edges and often resulting in blurred predictions. In this paper, we propose the
Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective that explicitly divides
pixels into three categories, edge, boundary, and texture, and assigns each a
distinct supervisory weight. This tri-class formulation enables more structured
learning by guiding the model to focus on both edge precision and contextual
boundary localization. We theoretically show that the EBT loss generalizes the
WBCE loss, with the latter becoming a limit case. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the EBT loss both
quantitatively and perceptually. Furthermore, the consistent use of unified
hyperparameters across all models and datasets, along with robustness to their
moderate variations, indicates that the EBT loss requires minimal fine-tuning
and is easily deployable in practice.

Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型（VLMs）存在幻觉问题，影响可靠性，而传统偏好优化方法面临数据分布不均、专家标注成本高等挑战。

Method: 提出CheXPO策略，包括多任务胸部X光视觉指令数据集合成、基于置信度的困难样本挖掘、相似性检索扩展样本，以及反事实推理提供临床偏好。

Result: 实验显示，CheXPO仅用5%的SFT样本即实现8.93%的性能提升，达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: CheXPO为放射学应用提供了一种可扩展、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations that critically
compromise reliability in medical applications. While preference optimization
can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation
faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced
data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these
challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy
that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale.
Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest
X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level
confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to
expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while
synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences,
eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO
achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching
state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a
scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.

Method: MOST采用时间片段Banzhaf交互量化文本-运动一致性，并在生成阶段利用检索到的运动片段生成语义一致的运动。

Result: MOST在文本到运动的检索和生成任务中达到最先进性能，尤其在罕见提示上表现突出。

Conclusion: MOST通过细粒度匹配和消除冗余，显著提升了文本到运动生成的效果。

Abstract: We introduce MOST, a novel motion diffusion model via temporal clip Banzhaf
interaction, aimed at addressing the persistent challenge of generating human
motion from rare language prompts. While previous approaches struggle with
coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion
redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships
to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation
of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies
textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct,
fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy.
In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved
motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive
evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion
retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous
challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results
highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和CheXpert Plus基准测试中，MCA-RG表现优异。

Conclusion: MCA-RG通过知识驱动的方法显著提升了放射学报告生成的准确性和临床相关性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for
radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to
difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to
their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature
extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To
address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report
Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual
features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation
process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing
lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The
visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored
enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure
to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching
loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.
Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality
concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual
medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process.
Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate
that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in
radiology report generation.

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提升了分割性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过自适应边界对比学习和模糊性预测，显著改善了3D语义分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive margin contrastive learning method for 3D
semantic segmentation on point clouds. Most existing methods use equally
penalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less
discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly
ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually
annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points
would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design
AMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity
estimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points
based on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,
which ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes
for high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position
discrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by
the assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking
ambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further
propose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where
a novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from
generated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that
leverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more
reliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.
Experimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at

Motivation: NSCLC患者免疫治疗的精准预后对个性化治疗至关重要，但缺乏大规模数据集和有效的多模态特征融合方法。

Method: 构建大规模数据集，提出跨模态掩码学习框架，包括Slice-Depth Transformer和基于图的Transformer，分别处理CT图像和临床数据。

Result: 方法在多模态整合中表现优异，超越了现有方法，为NSCLC预后模型设定了新标准。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了NSCLC生存预测的准确性，为个性化治疗提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing
immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling
informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality
of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective
multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this
domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and
introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing
the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and
corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning
approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each
tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting
3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node
features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion
process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model
utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism
improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more
effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival
prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for
prognostic models in this context.

Method: 使用双摄像头系统（DCS）分别捕获参考和非参考序列，并设计EAFNet进行特征对齐、选择性融合和多尺度重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同数据集上达到最先进性能，验证了DCS的潜力。

Conclusion: DCS和EAFNet的组合有效解决了HDR视频重建中的闪烁问题，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: In HDR video reconstruction, exposure fluctuations in reference images from
alternating exposure methods often result in flickering. To address this issue,
we propose a dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video acquisition, where one
camera is assigned to capture consistent reference sequences, while the other
is assigned to capture non-reference sequences for information supplementation.
To tackle the challenges posed by video data, we introduce an exposure-adaptive
fusion network (EAFNet) to achieve more robust results. EAFNet introduced a
pre-alignment subnetwork to explore the influence of exposure, selectively
emphasizing the valuable features across different exposure levels. Then, the
enhanced features are fused by the asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork,
which explores reference-dominated attention maps to improve image fusion by
aligning cross-scale features and performing cross-feature fusion. Finally, the
reconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce
ghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, validating the great
potential of the DCS in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured
by DCS will be available at https://github.com/zqqqyu/DCS.

*Xu Shaowu,Jia Xibin,Gao Junyu,Sun Qianmei,Chang Jing,Fan Chao*

TL;DR: CMDCL提出了一种跨模态双因果学习方法，通过文本和视觉因果干预解决长时动作识别中的跨模态偏差和视觉混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时动作识别（LTAR）因时间跨度长、动作关联复杂及视觉混淆而具有挑战性，现有方法缺乏跨模态因果建模。

Method: CMDCL引入结构因果模型，通过文本因果干预和视觉因果干预，消除跨模态偏差和视觉混淆。

Result: 在Charades、Breakfast和COIN三个基准测试中验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: CMDCL通过双因果干预实现了鲁棒的动作表示，解决了LTAR的挑战。

Abstract: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is challenging due to extended temporal
spans with complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. Although
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on
statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing
causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal
causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes
\textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning
(CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal
relationships between videos and label texts.
  CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal
intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through
visual causal intervention guided by the debiased text.
  These dual-causal interventions enable robust action representations to
address LTAR challenges. Experimental results on three benchmarks including
Charades, Breakfast and COIN, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model. Our code is available at https://github.com/xushaowu/CMDCL.

*Yulin An,Enrique del Castillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于几何深度学习的框架，用于高效预测CAD网格的Laplace-Beltrami（LB）谱，显著节省计算时间且保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法（FEM）计算LB谱复杂度高，不适用于频繁处理大规模CAD网格的场景，如质量控制。

Method: 采用图神经网络（GNN）架构，结合高斯曲率、平均曲率等丰富特征，预测LB谱。

Result: 实验表明，该方法计算时间比线性FEM减少约5倍，同时保持竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: LB谱是可学习的，提出的方法在效率和准确性上均优于传统FEM。

Abstract: The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric
deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object
under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a
triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM),
and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is
the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when
repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control
applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions
about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution
to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the
LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant
computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB
spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a
rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature,
and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make
available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical
CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training
and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time
of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering
competitive accuracy.

*Qing Zhang,Guoquan Pei,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Omni-Fuse的空间-光谱全融合网络，用于高光谱图像分割，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学高光谱成像（MHSI）在疾病诊断中具有潜力，但高维度和光谱冗余特性使其信息融合具有挑战性。

Method: 设计了跨维度特征融合操作，包括双向注意力机制、光谱引导的空间查询选择和两阶段跨维度解码器。

Result: 在两个数据集上实验表明，Omni-Fuse在DSC指标上比现有方法提升了5.73%。

Conclusion: Omni-Fuse有效解决了MHSI信息融合问题，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) has emerged as a promising tool for
enhanced disease diagnosis, particularly in computational pathology, offering
rich spectral information that aids in identifying subtle biochemical
properties of tissues. Despite these advantages, effectively fusing both
spatial-dimensional and spectral-dimensional information from MHSIs remains
challenging due to its high dimensionality and spectral redundancy inherent
characteristics. To solve the above challenges, we propose a novel
spatial-spectral omni-fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation,
named as Omni-Fuse. Here, we introduce abundant cross-dimensional feature
fusion operations, including a cross-dimensional enhancement module that
refines both spatial and spectral features through bidirectional attention
mechanisms, a spectral-guided spatial query selection to select the most
spectral-related spatial feature as the query, and a two-stage
cross-dimensional decoder which dynamically guide the model to focus on the
selected spatial query. Despite of numerous attention blocks, Omni-Fuse remains
efficient in execution. Experiments on two microscopic hyperspectral image
datasets show that our approach can significantly improve the segmentation
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, with over 5.73 percent
improvement in DSC. Code available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视点依赖投影（VDP）的点云分割方法，通过动态适应不同视点的空间几何，生成高效的数据驱动投影，减少计算开销并提升语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于投影的方法依赖于预定义参数，无法适应不同视点的多样性，且多投影导致计算冗余。

Method: 设计了VDP框架，通过数据驱动生成自适应投影，并引入颜色正则化优化特征提取。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet基准测试中表现优异，计算成本低。

Conclusion: PointVDP提供了一种资源高效的语义理解解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose view-dependent projection (VDP) to facilitate point
cloud segmentation, designing efficient 3D-to-2D mapping that dynamically
adapts to the spatial geometry from view variations. Existing projection-based
methods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on
straight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions.
However, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to
pre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and
failing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view
planes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to
enhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive
computational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these
limitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections
from 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs
by predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks. In addition,
we construct color regularization to optimize the framework, which emphasizes
essential features within semantic pixels and suppresses the non-semantic
features within black pixels, thereby maximizing 2D space utilization in a
projected image. As a result, our approach, PointVDP, develops lightweight
projections in marginal computation costs. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet
benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive results, offering a
resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding.

Motivation: 医学领域中，密集像素级标注成本高且不现实，尤其是在新任务中。学习从少量像素级标注中提取信息，可以推动研究进展。

Method: 将问题建模为稀疏热图回归，提出Crag and Tail损失函数，高效利用稀疏标注并减少假阴性影响。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，该方法在癌变关键点密集定位任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏标注场景下具有潜力，可推动医学图像分析研究。

Abstract: Learning from sparse labels is a challenge commonplace in the medical domain.
This is due to numerous factors, such as annotation cost, and is especially
true for newly introduced tasks. When dense pixel-level annotations are needed,
this becomes even more unfeasible. However, being able to learn from just a few
annotations at the pixel-level, while extremely difficult and underutilized,
can drive progress in studies where perfect annotations are not immediately
available. This work tackles the challenge of learning the dense prediction
task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in the context of 2d
carcinosis keypoint localization from laparoscopic video frames for diagnostic
planning of advanced ovarian cancer patients. To enable this, we formulate the
problem as a sparse heatmap regression from a few point annotations per image
and propose a new loss function, called Crag and Tail loss, for efficient
learning. Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse
labels while minimizing the impact of false negatives or missed annotations.
Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints,
highlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense
annotations are challenging to obtain.

Conclusion: ClipGS在渲染质量和效率上表现优异，为医学可视化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The visualization of volumetric medical data is crucial for enhancing
diagnostic accuracy and improving surgical planning and education. Cinematic
rendering techniques significantly enrich this process by providing
high-quality visualizations that convey intricate anatomical details, thereby
facilitating better understanding and decision-making in medical contexts.
However, the high computing cost and low rendering speed limit the requirement
of interactive visualization in practical applications. In this paper, we
introduce ClipGS, an innovative Gaussian splatting framework with the clipping
plane supported, for interactive cinematic visualization of volumetric medical
data. To address the challenges posed by dynamic interactions, we propose a
learnable truncation scheme that automatically adjusts the visibility of
Gaussian primitives in response to the clipping plane. Besides, we also design
an adaptive adjustment model to dynamically adjust the deformation of Gaussians
and refine the rendering performance. We validate our method on five volumetric
medical data (including CT and anatomical slice data), and reach an average
36.635 PSNR rendering quality with 156 FPS and 16.1 MB model size,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and efficiency.

TL;DR: Diff$^2$I2P 是一种基于扩散先验的全可微分图像到点云（I2P）配准框架，通过控制侧分数蒸馏（CSD）和可变形对应调整（DCT）模块，显著提升跨模态对应关系，实现优于现有方法的配准效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过度量学习强制跨模态特征对齐，但忽视了图像与点云数据之间的固有模态差距，导致跨模态对应关系不准确。

Method: 提出 Diff$^2$I2P 框架，利用扩散先验和 CSD 技术优化变换预测，并通过 DCT 模块和可微分 PnP 求解器实现可微分的对应关系估计。

Result: 在 7-Scenes 基准测试中，Diff$^2$I2P 的配准召回率比现有最优方法提高了 7% 以上。

Conclusion: Diff$^2$I2P 通过扩散先验指导跨模态特征学习，显著提升了 I2P 配准的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Learning cross-modal correspondences is essential for image-to-point cloud
(I2P) registration. Existing methods achieve this mostly by utilizing metric
learning to enforce feature alignment across modalities, disregarding the
inherent modality gap between image and point data. Consequently, this paradigm
struggles to ensure accurate cross-modal correspondences. To this end, inspired
by the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we
propose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework,
leveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap.
Specifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to
distill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize
the predicted transformation. However, the gradients on the transformation fail
to backpropagate onto the cross-modal features due to the non-differentiability
of correspondence retrieval and PnP solver. To this end, we further propose a
Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) module to estimate the correspondences
in a differentiable way, followed by the transformation estimation using a
differentiable PnP solver. With these two designs, the Diffusion model serves
as a strong prior to guide the cross-modal feature learning of image and point
cloud for forming robust correspondences, which significantly improves the
registration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Diff$^2$I2P
consistently outperforms SoTA I2P registration methods, achieving over 7%
improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.

Conclusion: SPGD通过梯度管理技术有效解决了扩散模型中的不稳定问题，为图像恢复任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by
leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration
problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a
denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions
between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In
this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and
identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts
between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal
fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these
instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration
performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive
Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD
integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up
strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum
(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive
experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD
significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results. Code is

Conclusion: MK-Pose通过多模态融合和图关系建模，显著提升了类别级物体姿态估计的性能。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation, which predicts the pose of objects
within a known category without prior knowledge of individual instances, is
essential in applications like warehouse automation and manufacturing. Existing
methods relying on RGB images or point cloud data often struggle with object
occlusion and generalization across different instances and categories. This
paper proposes a multimodal-based keypoint learning framework (MK-Pose) that
integrates RGB images, point clouds, and category-level textual descriptions.
The model uses a self-supervised keypoint detection module enhanced with
attention-based query generation, soft heatmap matching and graph-based
relational modeling. Additionally, a graph-enhanced feature fusion module is
designed to integrate local geometric information and global context. MK-Pose
is evaluated on CAMERA25 and REAL275 dataset, and is further tested for
cross-dataset capability on HouseCat6D dataset. The results demonstrate that
MK-Pose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both IoU and average
precision without shape priors. Codes will be released at

Motivation: 大规模3D模型的需求增长需要有效的压缩方法，以减少内存和计算成本，尤其是在资源有限的移动和边缘设备上。

Method: FlexGaussian结合混合精度量化和属性判别剪枝，无需重新训练即可适应不同的压缩目标。

Result: FlexGaussian实现了高达96.4%的压缩率，同时保持高渲染质量（PSNR下降<1 dB），并在移动设备上可部署。

Conclusion: FlexGaussian是一种灵活且高效的3D高斯压缩方法，优于现有方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has become a prominent technique for representing and
rendering complex 3D scenes, due to its high fidelity and speed advantages.
However, the growing demand for large-scale models calls for effective
compression to reduce memory and computation costs, especially on mobile and
edge devices with limited resources. Existing compression methods effectively
reduce 3D Gaussian parameters but often require extensive retraining or
fine-tuning, lacking flexibility under varying compression constraints.
  In this paper, we introduce FlexGaussian, a flexible and cost-effective
method that combines mixed-precision quantization with attribute-discriminative
pruning for training-free 3D Gaussian compression. FlexGaussian eliminates the
need for retraining and adapts easily to diverse compression targets.
Evaluation results show that FlexGaussian achieves up to 96.4% compression
while maintaining high rendering quality (<1 dB drop in PSNR), and is
deployable on mobile devices. FlexGaussian delivers high compression ratios
within seconds, being 1.7-2.1x faster than state-of-the-art training-free
methods and 10-100x faster than training-involved approaches. The code is being
prepared and will be released soon at:

Conclusion: QUANet通过增强数量感知和优化解码器设计，显著提升了计数任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative
methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in
images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately
distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose
QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a
vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness.
Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a
Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN
enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The
T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation
between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss
is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the
two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147,
CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability
for zero-shot class-agnostic counting. Code is available at

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on
free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such
as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language
fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D
scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target
objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods
struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language
queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from
inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D
scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural
representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial
reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature
field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in
language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial
relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial
relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner
incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical
feature field. This field represents language and instance features using
distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a
hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial
relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework
can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,
outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their
spatial reasoning capability.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) attempts to convert sign language videos into
spoken sentences. However, many existing methods struggle with the disparity
between visual and textual representations during end-to-end learning.
Gloss-based approaches help to bridge this gap by leveraging structured
linguistic information. While, gloss-free methods offer greater flexibility and
remove the burden of annotation, they require effective alignment strategies.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled gloss-free SLT by
generating text-like representations from sign videos. In this work, we
introduce a novel hierarchical pre-training strategy inspired by the structure
of sign language, incorporating pseudo-glosses and contrastive video-language
alignment. Our method hierarchically extracts features at frame, segment, and
video levels, aligning them with pseudo-glosses and the spoken sentence to
enhance translation quality. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves
BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while maintaining efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉适配器、提示学习和部分最优传输（POT）与对比学习（CL）的新方法，用于改进CLIP在医学图像异常检测中的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学异常检测面临成像模态多样、解剖变异和标记数据有限等挑战，需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: 采用多提示学习与POT对齐局部特征，结合对比学习增强类内凝聚和类间分离。

Result: 在少样本、零样本和跨数据集场景中取得最先进结果，无需合成数据或记忆库。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了医学图像异常检测的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is challenging due to diverse imaging
modalities, anatomical variations, and limited labeled data. We propose a novel
approach combining visual adapters and prompt learning with Partial Optimal
Transport (POT) and contrastive learning (CL) to improve CLIP's adaptability to
medical images, particularly for AD. Unlike standard prompt learning, which
often yields a single representation, our method employs multiple prompts
aligned with local features via POT to capture subtle abnormalities. CL further
enforces intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in few-shot, zero-shot, and cross-dataset scenarios
without synthetic data or memory banks. The code is available at

TL;DR: RPFNet通过残差先验和频域融合模块解决图像融合中的计算成本和互补特征捕获问题，显著提升了融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像融合需要整合多模态信息以提升视觉任务性能，但全局空间建模计算成本高且缺乏真实数据支持。

Method: RPFNet采用双分支框架：残差先验模块提取模态差异信息，频域融合模块实现高效全局特征建模，交叉促进模块增强局部与全局特征协同。

Result: 实验证明RPFNet能有效整合特征、增强纹理细节和显著目标，提升视觉任务性能。

Conclusion: RPFNet通过频域和残差先验的结合，解决了图像融合中的关键挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information across modalities to
generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing the performance of
high-level vision tasks. While global spatial modeling mechanisms show
promising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial
domain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of
ground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features
effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven
Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a
dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM)
extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby
providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module
(FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through
frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM)
enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures
through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an
auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's
sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of
adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively
constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details
and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information.
Extensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which
effectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and
salient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the
high-level vision task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于提示复杂度的自适应缓存方法（PCA缓存），通过动态调整重用阈值和优化输入输出关系建模，显著提升了视频生成的推理速度，同时保持高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成中的固定频率缓存机制在复杂场景中效果不佳，手动调整阈值效率低下且缺乏鲁棒性，需要一种更智能的自适应方法。

Method: 提出PCA缓存，根据输入提示估计场景复杂度动态调整重用阈值；改进TeaCache的输入输出关系建模；引入动态CFGCache机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在Wan2.1模型上实现了2.79倍的加速，同时保持了高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: PCA缓存和动态CFGCache的结合显著提升了视频生成的效率和输出质量，为复杂场景提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major
bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via
caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such
fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while
manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To
address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that
automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated
directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,
PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional
caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a
key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to
an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance
the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's
predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To
further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with
DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free
guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for
more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example,
2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across
a range of scenes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种局部与全局双粒度身份关联机制，用于弱监督文本到人物图像匹配，显著提升了跨模态匹配准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理复杂的一对多身份关系，限制了性能提升，因此需要一种新机制来增强模型的识别能力。

Method: 采用局部与全局双粒度身份关联机制，局部层面显式建立跨模态身份关系，全局层面构建动态跨模态身份关联网络，并结合信息不对称样本对构建与一致性学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了跨模态匹配的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为文本到人物图像匹配提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-to-person image matching, as a crucial approach to
reducing models' reliance on large-scale manually labeled samples, holds
significant research value. However, existing methods struggle to predict
complex one-to-many identity relationships, severely limiting performance
improvements. To address this challenge, we propose a local-and-global
dual-granularity identity association mechanism. Specifically, at the local
level, we explicitly establish cross-modal identity relationships within a
batch, reinforcing identity constraints across different modalities and
enabling the model to better capture subtle differences and correlations. At
the global level, we construct a dynamic cross-modal identity association
network with the visual modality as the anchor and introduce a confidence-based
dynamic adjustment mechanism, effectively enhancing the model's ability to
identify weakly associated samples while improving overall sensitivity.
Additionally, we propose an information-asymmetric sample pair construction
method combined with consistency learning to tackle hard sample mining and
enhance model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method substantially boosts cross-modal matching accuracy, providing an
efficient and practical solution for text-to-person image matching.

Conclusion: 该研究为濒危语言OCR提供了可迁移的框架，降低了技术和财务门槛，使历史学家和语言学家能够处理历史档案。

Abstract: Manchu, a critically endangered language essential for understanding early
modern Eastern Eurasian history, lacks effective OCR systems that can handle
real-world historical documents. This study develops high-performing OCR
systems by fine-tuning three open-source vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-11B,
Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on 60,000 synthetic Manchu word images using
parameter-efficient training. LLaMA-3.2-11B achieved exceptional performance
with 98.3\% word accuracy and 0.0024 character error rate on synthetic data,
while crucially maintaining 93.1\% accuracy on real-world handwritten
documents. Comparative evaluation reveals substantial advantages over
traditional approaches: while a CRNN baseline achieved 99.8\% synthetic
accuracy, it suffered severe degradation to 72.5\% on real documents. Our
approach demonstrates effective synthetic-to-real domain transfer, providing a
cost-effective solution deployable on accessible infrastructure. This work
establishes a transferable framework for endangered language OCR that removes
technical and financial barriers in digital humanities, enabling historians and
linguists to process historical archives without specialized computing
resources. Code and model weights are available at

Abstract: Thermal imaging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) holds significant
potential for applications in search and rescue, wildlife monitoring, and
emergency response, especially under low-light or obscured conditions. However,
the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the
advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high
cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we
introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images
from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into
existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and
orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the
background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object
categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the
HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating
these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across
both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new
applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors
outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the
importance of replicating aerial viewing angles. Project page:

Conclusion: GreenHyperSpectra为植物功能性状评估与表征学习的交叉研究提供了方法论框架和数据支持。

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential
variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However,
conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at
ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable
solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral
data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral
data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across
sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods.
Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing
real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait
prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation
framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We
successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient
multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised
baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in
learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a
comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection
of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment. All code and

Motivation: 现有基于sRGB和HSV颜色空间的低光图像增强方法存在颜色偏差和噪声问题，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出HVI颜色空间（结合HV颜色图和可学习强度）和HVI-CIDNet+网络（利用预训练视觉语言模型和Prior-guided Attention Block）。

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验表明，HVI-CIDNet+优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HVI颜色空间和HVI-CIDNet+网络有效解决了低光图像增强中的颜色和噪声问题，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to restore vivid content and details
from corrupted low-light images. However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color
space-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due
to the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)
color space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red
and black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color
space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV
color map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances
for the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable
intensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.
Additionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+
(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and
mitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+
leverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light
images using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel
Prior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can
promote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color
correction, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the
meticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we
construct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for
information-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions,
ensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark
experiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that
has been extensively studied in recent years. Traditional approaches often rely
on external modules like Class Activation Maps to highlight regions of interest
and generate pseudo segmentation masks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end
method that directly utilizes the attention maps learned by a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for WSSS. We propose training a sparse ViT with multiple
[CLS] tokens (one for each class), using a random masking strategy to promote
[CLS] token - class assignment. At inference time, we aggregate the different
self-attention maps of each [CLS] token corresponding to the predicted labels
to generate pseudo segmentation masks. Our proposed approach enhances the
interpretability of self-attention maps and ensures accurate class assignments.
Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and three specialized datasets
demonstrate that our method generates accurate pseudo-masks, outperforming
related works. Those pseudo-masks can be used to train a segmentation model
which achieves results comparable to fully-supervised models, significantly
reducing the need for fine-grained labeled data.

Abstract: Semantic scene understanding, including the perception and classification of
moving agents, is essential to enabling safe and robust driving behaviours of
autonomous vehicles. Cameras and LiDARs are commonly used for semantic scene
understanding. However, both sensor modalities face limitations in adverse
weather and usually do not provide motion information. Radar sensors overcome
these limitations and directly offer information about moving agents by
measuring the Doppler velocity, but the measurements are comparably sparse and
noisy. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation in sparse
radar point clouds to enhance scene understanding. Our approach, called
SemRaFiner, accounts for changing density in sparse radar point clouds and
optimizes the feature extraction to improve accuracy. Furthermore, we propose
an optimized training procedure to refine instance assignments by incorporating
a dedicated data augmentation. Our experiments suggest that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for radar-based panoptic segmentation.

Conclusion: APL通过自适应部分学习和对比损失，有效解决了GCD中区分性与泛化性的权衡问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize unlabeled images from
known and novel classes by distinguishing novel classes from known ones, while
also transferring knowledge from another set of labeled images with known
classes. Existing GCD methods rely on self-supervised vision transformers such
as DINO for representation learning. However, focusing solely on the global
representation of the DINO CLS token introduces an inherent trade-off between
discriminability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive
part discovery and learning method, called APL, which generates consistent
object parts and their correspondences across different similar images using a
set of shared learnable part queries and DINO part priors, without requiring
any additional annotations. More importantly, we propose a novel all-min
contrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation,
which adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar
categories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other
parts to facilitate knowledge transfer for improved generalization. Our APL can
easily be incorporated into different GCD frameworks by replacing their CLS
token feature with our part representations, showing significant enhancements
on fine-grained datasets.

Abstract: Research on the attribute information of calligraphy, such as styles,
dynasties, and calligraphers, holds significant cultural and historical value.
However, the styles of Chinese calligraphy characters have evolved dramatically
through different dynasties and the unique touches of calligraphers, making it
highly challenging to accurately recognize these different characters and their
attributes. Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,
and most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute
information. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of
Chinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute
Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765
categories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese
calligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on
the attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),
dynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich
multi-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,
including calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and
evolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance
through single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all
of its subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of the
stroke structure of the calligraphic characters, and the interplay between
their different attributes, leading to a substantial increase in the difficulty
of accurate recognition. MCCD not only fills a void in the availability of
detailed calligraphy datasets but also provides valuable resources for
advancing research in Chinese calligraphy and fostering advancements in
multiple fields. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Ancient populations markedly transformed Neotropical forests, yet
understanding the long-term effects of ancient human management, particularly
at high-resolution scales, remains challenging. In this work we propose a new
approach to investigate archaeological areas of influence based on vegetation
signatures. It consists of a deep learning model trained on satellite imagery
to identify palm trees, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify palm
clusters, which are then used to estimate ancient management areas. To assess
the palm distribution in relation to past human activity, we applied the
proposed approach to unique high-resolution satellite imagery data covering 765
km2 of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. With this work, we also
release a manually annotated palm tree dataset along with estimated locations
of archaeological sites from ground-surveys and legacy records. Results
demonstrate how palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological
sites showing large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm
cluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major
infrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated
by archaeological evidence alone. Our findings suggest that pre-Columbian
populations influenced local vegetation fostering conditions conducive to palm
proliferation, leaving a lasting ecological footprint. This may have lowered
the logistical costs of establishing infrastructure-heavy settlements in
otherwise less accessible locations. Overall, this study demonstrates the
potential of integrating artificial intelligence approaches with new ecological
and archaeological data to identify archaeological areas of interest through
vegetation patterns, revealing fine-scale human-environment interactions.

Motivation: 准确的变形图像配准（DIR）在MR引导自适应放疗（MRgART）中至关重要，用于轮廓传播和剂量累积。本研究旨在开发一种领域不变的MR-MR配准方法。

Method: 研究使用262对3T MR模拟扫描训练了ProRSeg方法，采用加权分割一致性损失。测试数据集包括同领域、跨领域和混合领域MR图像，评估轮廓传播和剂量累积的准确性。

Result: ProRSeg在膀胱配准中表现出跨领域的泛化能力（DSC 0.88-0.86），而直肠和CTV的性能则依赖领域。剂量累积结果显示83.3%的患者满足CTV覆盖和膀胱保护约束。

Conclusion: ProRSeg在多领域MR-MR配准中表现合理，初步验证了其在评估治疗合规性中的可行性。

Abstract: Background: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is required for
contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy
(MRgART). This study trained and evaluated a deep learning DIR method for
domain invariant MR-MR registration. Methods: A progressively refined
registration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T
MR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation
consistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR
Linac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour
propagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose
accumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART.
Results: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice
Similarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV,
performance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL
dataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain
performance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose
accumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95
>= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 <= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients
achieved minimum mean target dose (>40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under
upper limit (<42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain
MR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary
feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Percep360的全景生成方法，用于自动驾驶，解决了现有方法在数据分布固定和可控性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要全面的360度全景感知，但数据采集和标注复杂耗时。现有方法无法实现高质量、可控的全景生成。

Method: 提出了局部场景扩散方法（LSDM）和概率提示方法（PPM），分别解决信息丢失和可控生成问题。

Result: 生成图像在无参考质量指标上优于原始拼接图像，并提升了下游感知模型的性能。

Conclusion: Percep360在自动驾驶全景生成中表现出色，具有高质量和可控性优势。

Abstract: Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving,
enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\deg} surround view in a
single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete
panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation
pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing
street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration
capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing
datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In
this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for
autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data
with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on
two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the
inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose
the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama
generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps
between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable
generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method
(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling
controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e.,
no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in
real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data
consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality
metrics and enhances downstream perception models. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/Bryant-Teng/Percep360.

Conclusion: MassID45数据集为昆虫多样性和机器学习研究提供了新工具，推动了小物体检测和实例分割技术的发展。

Abstract: Insects comprise millions of species, many experiencing severe population
declines under environmental and habitat changes. High-throughput approaches
are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA
barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic
taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on
individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in
large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample
Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic
classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging
data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual
specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two
tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual
arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining
the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of
bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of
insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection
and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine
learning research.

TL;DR: FreeTTA是一种无需训练且通用的测试时适应方法，通过显式建模测试数据分布，利用在线EM算法提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统测试时适应方法依赖昂贵训练或优化过程的问题，提升在域偏移和分布变化下的适应性。

Method: 引入在线EM算法，利用VLMs的零样本预测作为先验，迭代更新测试样本的后验概率和参数。

Result: 在15个数据集的跨域和分布外设置中，FreeTTA显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeTTA为测试时适应提供了一种灵活且高效的新范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become prominent in open-world image
recognition for their strong generalization abilities. Yet, their effectiveness
in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional
changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.
Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the
use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample
predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA
methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or
make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and
test data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and
universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the
flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model
the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among
test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous
access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages
by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from
VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each
online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA
achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution
settings.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的感知系统在恶劣天气下易受传感器性能下降的影响，集体感知虽能缓解这一问题，但相关研究较少。

Method: 提出DenoiseCP-Net，一种集成体素级去噪和对象检测的多任务架构，基于稀疏卷积骨干网络，避免冗余计算。

Result: DenoiseCP-Net在恶劣天气下实现了近乎完美的去噪效果，带宽需求降低23.6%，同时保持检测精度并减少延迟。

Conclusion: DenoiseCP-Net为恶劣天气下的集体感知提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: While automated vehicles hold the potential to significantly reduce traffic
accidents, their perception systems remain vulnerable to sensor degradation
caused by adverse weather and environmental occlusions. Collective perception,
which enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to
overcoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in
adverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of
LiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present
a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under
adverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception
capabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due
to the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior
to communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose
DenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective
perception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates
voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse
convolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with
two-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and
computational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing
non-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating
rain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We
demonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in
adverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while
maintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for
cooperative vehicles.

Motivation: 多模态推理研究中模态对齐和训练成本高，现有方法依赖额外标注和复杂奖励，限制了扩展性。

Method: 提出D2I框架，训练时通过规则奖励增强模态对齐，测试时转为直觉推理。

Result: D2I在领域内外基准测试中优于基线，展示了规则奖励对可迁移推理能力的作用。

Conclusion: D2I为多模态LLMs提供了一种高效训练方法，并启发了训练与测试推理深度的解耦方向。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key capability for large language models (LLMs), particularly
when applied to complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However,
multimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality
alignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data
annotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and
reasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the
Deliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the
understanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra
annotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate
reasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based
format reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to
intuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and
implicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I
outperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our
findings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable
reasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time
reasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.

Result: 在BreakHis和PatchGastric数据集上，分类F1得分为0.934，AUC为0.963；描述BLEU-4得分为0.811，METEOR得分为0.569。

Conclusion: GNN-ViTCap在分类和描述任务中表现优异，为病理诊断提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer
diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning
have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI
face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to
subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology
captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce
a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from
histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor
generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically
clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting
representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph
by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and
apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The
aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space
through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large
language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric
datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for
classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569
for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms
state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for
microscopy based patient diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该方法为从组织学图像高效预测细胞组成提供了一种可行的解决方案，避免了昂贵的空间转录组学实验。

Abstract: The rapid development of digital pathology and modern deep learning has
facilitated the emergence of pathology foundation models that are expected to
solve general pathology problems under various disease conditions in one
unified model, with or without fine-tuning. In parallel, spatial
transcriptomics has emerged as a transformative technology that enables the
profiling of gene expression on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology
images. Spatial transcriptomics unlocks the unprecedented opportunity to dive
into existing histology images at a more granular, cellular level. In this
work, we propose a lightweight and training-efficient approach to predict
cellular composition directly from H&E-stained histology images by leveraging
information-enriched feature embeddings extracted from pre-trained pathology
foundation models. By training a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
regressor on cell-type abundances derived via cell2location, our method
efficiently distills knowledge from pathology foundation models and
demonstrates the ability to accurately predict cell-type compositions from
histology images, without physically performing the costly spatial
transcriptomics. Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to
existing methods such as Hist2Cell, while significantly reducing computational
complexity.

Conclusion: MST-Distill通过动态教师模型和掩码模块有效解决了跨模态蒸馏中的关键问题，提升了知识转移效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation as an efficient knowledge transfer technique, has
achieved remarkable success in unimodal scenarios. However, in cross-modal
settings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges
due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the
complementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This
paper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:
distillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,
we propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework
featuring a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse
ensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal
configurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that
facilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively
transcends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and
static teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,
independently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and
reconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and
enhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse
multimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge
distillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks. The source code is

Motivation: 现有研究主要评估专有模型（如GPT-4），忽略了其他LMMs的潜力，且上下文元数据与推理修饰符的交互影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过整合GPS坐标、时间戳和食物种类等元数据，结合多种推理修饰符（如思维链、多模态思维链等），评估八种LMMs的性能。

Result: 元数据整合显著降低了营养值预测的平均绝对误差（MAE）和平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的LMMs在营养分析中具有显著潜力，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to meal images for
nutrition analysis. However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary
models, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored.
Additionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its
interaction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This
work investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS
coordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into
meal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in
estimating key nutritional values. These values include calories,
macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also
introduce ACETADA, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This
open dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and
serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs
(four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of
contextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images
alone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information
enhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought,
Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona.
Empirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied
through straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted
nutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs
for improved nutrition analysis.

Abstract: Accurately converting pixel measurements into absolute real-world dimensions
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and limits progress in key
applications such as biomedicine, forensics, nutritional analysis, and
e-commerce. We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly
infers scale "in the wild" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified
keypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with
geometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective
transformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds
or rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter
marks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling
strong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while
mitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline
that combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add
photorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving
performance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a
lightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression
parameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling
real-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices. Experiments show that
RulerNet delivers accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under
challenging real-world conditions. These results underscore its utility as a
generalizable measurement tool and its potential for integration with other
vision components for automated, scale-aware analysis in high-impact domains. A

Conclusion: L-VQAScore是一种可靠且可扩展的评估方法，有望替代主观评估。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
evaluation remains challenging in domains like fashion, involving complex
compositional generation. Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage
pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However,
our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich
entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e.,
when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To
address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization
strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual
modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a
novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual
localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized
(leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring
challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms
state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human
judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained
entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and
scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.

Abstract: Generating diverse and natural human motion sequences based on textual
descriptions constitutes a fundamental and challenging research area within the
domains of computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements in this field, current methodologies often face challenges
regarding zero-shot generalization capabilities, largely attributable to the
limited size of training datasets. Moreover, the lack of a comprehensive
evaluation framework impedes the advancement of this task by failing to
identify directions for improvement. In this work, we aim to push
text-to-motion into a new era, that is, to achieve the generalization ability
of zero-shot. To this end, firstly, we develop an efficient annotation pipeline
and introduce MotionMillion-the largest human motion dataset to date, featuring
over 2,000 hours and 2 million high-quality motion sequences. Additionally, we
propose MotionMillion-Eval, the most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
zero-shot motion generation. Leveraging a scalable architecture, we scale our
model to 7B parameters and validate its performance on MotionMillion-Eval. Our
results demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain and complex
compositional motions, marking a significant step toward zero-shot human motion
generation. The code is available at

Conclusion: VLV框架通过高效利用预训练模型，显著降低了数据需求和训练成本，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong
captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of
high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper
introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which
strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the
decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large
Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by
regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the
pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills
knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous
embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality
reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the
intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct
a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o
and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and
significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal
images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models
(image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for
massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure
under $1,000 USD.

TL;DR: 4KAgent是一个统一的超分辨率通用系统，可将任何图像提升至4K分辨率，甚至更高。它通过三个核心组件实现：Profiling、Perception Agent和Restoration Agent，并在多个领域表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低分辨率图像恢复问题，尤其是严重退化的图像，提供高质量的4K输出。

Method: 系统包含三个核心模块：Profiling定制流程，Perception Agent分析输入并制定恢复计划，Restoration Agent执行计划并优化输出。

Result: 在11个任务类别和26个基准测试中表现优异，覆盖多种图像领域，包括自然图像、医学影像等。

Conclusion: 4KAgent为低层次视觉任务建立了新的代理范式，推动了视觉自主代理的创新。

Abstract: We present 4KAgent, a unified agentic super-resolution generalist system
designed to universally upscale any image to 4K resolution (and even higher, if
applied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low
resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at
256x256, into crystal-clear, photorealistic 4K outputs. 4KAgent comprises three
core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline
based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages
vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze
the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration
Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection
paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the
optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face
restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and
selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task
categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new
state-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover
natural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery,
fluorescence microscopy, and medical imaging like fundoscopy, ultrasound, and
X-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g.,
NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic
paradigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and
innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research
communities. We will release all the code, models, and results at:

TL;DR: 研究探讨了预训练文本到图像扩散模型作为视觉编码器的潜力，发现其能捕捉细粒度细节，并提出融合CLIP和扩散特征的方法以提升视觉问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs使用CLIP作为视觉编码器，但无法捕捉细粒度细节，限制了图像问答能力。

Method: 分析扩散模型内部表示，利用文本条件聚焦问题相关区域，并研究如何与LLM对齐，提出泄漏缓解策略和特征融合方法。

Result: 在通用VQA和专用MLLM基准测试中表现优异，尤其在需要空间和组合推理的任务中。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在视觉理解中具有潜力，特别是在细粒度和空间推理任务中，融合策略显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the
use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global
information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the
input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware
visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find
diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text
alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus
the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to
align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage
phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the
original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a
mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion
strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We
evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,
demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,
particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional
reasoning. Our project page can be found

*Jeremy Fischer,Ram Krishnamoorthy,Vishal Kumar,Mahdi Al-Husseini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEWI是一个三维多人模拟工具，用于模拟战场医疗撤离网络，提升教学效果和决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏在课堂环境中模拟医疗撤离网络并评估规划和决策的工具。

Method: 开发了基于Unity的三维多人模拟MEWI，模拟战场约束和不确定性，并引入两个实战场景。

Result: MEWI显著提升了学员对医疗撤离知识的掌握和协作决策能力。

Conclusion: MEWI是高保真医疗教育工具的重要进步，为联合部队的医疗撤离教育和操作提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and
critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating
the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing
a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and
treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to
simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline
planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the
Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer
simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and
uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty
collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and
evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious
island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road
and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as
many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during
didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations
of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical
Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from
student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning
decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify
general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially
improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative
decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of
high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings
offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and
operations across the joint force.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Prompt Declaration Language (PDL)，一种新型的提示表示方法，旨在解决现有提示工程框架的复杂性和不灵活性问题。PDL通过将提示置于核心位置，支持手动和自动提示调优，并整合LLM调用、规则代码和外部工具，提高了程序员的生产力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示工程框架要么通过限制性API隐藏复杂性，要么提供难以自定义的固定模式，导致复杂的代理编程变得困难。

Method: 提出PDL，一种声明性语言，将提示置于核心位置，支持手动和自动调优，并整合LLM调用、规则代码和外部工具。

Result: 通过实际案例（合规代理）展示了PDL的实用性，调优后的提示模式性能提升了4倍。

Conclusion: PDL通过抽象化组合逻辑，提高了程序员的生产力，并提供了一种可优化的声明性表示方法。

Abstract: Prompt engineering for LLMs remains complex, with existing frameworks either
hiding complexity behind restrictive APIs or providing inflexible canned
patterns that resist customization -- making sophisticated agentic programming
challenging. We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach
to prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing
prompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while
capturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and
external tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL
aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative
representation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's
utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the
prompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement
compared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern.

Conclusion: 研究为AI发展轨迹的潜在模式和影响提供了数学基础，对研究和政策制定具有重要启示。

Abstract: This paper investigates the Jolting Technologies Hypothesis, which posits
superexponential growth (increasing acceleration, or a positive third
derivative) in the development of AI capabilities. We develop a theoretical
framework and validate detection methodologies through Monte Carlo simulations,
while acknowledging that empirical validation awaits suitable longitudinal
data. Our analysis focuses on creating robust tools for future empirical
studies and exploring the potential implications should the hypothesis prove
valid. The study examines how factors such as shrinking idea-to-action
intervals and compounding iterative AI improvements drive this jolting pattern.
By formalizing jolt dynamics and validating detection methods through
simulation, this work provides the mathematical foundation necessary for
understanding potential AI trajectories and their consequences for AGI
emergence, offering insights for research and policy.

TL;DR: 论文证明了q-辩证系统比p-辩证系统更强大，后者又比d-辩证系统更强，强调了反例和矛盾在自动信念修正中的互补作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究辩证系统以统一、可计算的方式建模知识库的动态更新，尤其是数学家和研究社区的信念修正过程。

Method: 区分并比较三种辩证系统模型：d-辩证系统（基于不一致性修正）、p-辩证系统（基于反例修正）和q-辩证系统（结合两者）。通过理论证明q-辩证系统的更强能力。

Result: q-辩证系统严格强于p-辩证系统，后者又严格强于d-辩证系统。

Conclusion: 反例和矛盾在信念修正中具有互补作用，q-辩证系统为自动信念管理提供了更强大的框架。

Abstract: Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism for modeling an agent
updating a knowledge base seeking consistency. Introduced in the 1970s by
Roberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working
mathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth.
Dialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an
automated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief
management.
  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems:
(d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be
inconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding
a counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an
open problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are
strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known
to be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights
the complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief
revision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and
research communities.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何将SCC递归语义扩展到无限论证框架（AFs），提出了两种方法，并通过Baroni和Giacomin的标准评估其有效性，发现方向性在一般情况下失效，但在有限框架中部分语义满足方向性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCC递归语义在有限AFs中有效，但在无限AFs中因基础性问题失效，因此需要扩展其适用性。

Method: 提出了两种扩展SCC递归语义到无限AFs的方法，并系统评估其性能。

Result: 方向性在一般情况下失效，但在有限框架中部分语义满足方向性。

Conclusion: 研究为无限论证理论提供了基础，并为处理无界或动态领域的推理系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a foundational tool in artificial
intelligence for modeling structured reasoning and conflict. SCC-recursiveness
is a well-known design principle in which the evaluation of arguments is
decomposed according to the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the attack
graph, proceeding recursively from "higher" to "lower" components. While
SCC-recursive semantics such as \cft and \stgt have proven effective for finite
AFs, Baumann and Spanring showed the failure of SCC-recursive semantics to
generalize reliably to infinite AFs due to issues with well-foundedness.
  We propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite
setting. We systematically evaluate these semantics using Baroni and Giacomin's
established criteria, showing in particular that directionality fails in
general. We then examine these semantics' behavior in finitary frameworks,
where we find some of our semantics satisfy directionality. These results
advance the theory of infinite argumentation and lay the groundwork for
reasoning systems capable of handling unbounded or evolving domains.

Result: 构建了包含150万指令的高质量数据集InfinityInstruct-Subject，实验证明其提升模型指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为指令数据集从数量扩展到质量提升提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of
large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks.
Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for
enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction
datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may
still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.
This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of
task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the
instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction
data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,
an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis
process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These
components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage
and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct
InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million
instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities.
Further analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage
and depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work
lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous
evolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to
qualitative improvement.

Motivation: 传统旅行规划系统静态且碎片化，无法应对现实世界中的复杂性和突发变化，导致用户体验不佳。

Method: 提出三种协作代理：旅行规划代理（基于网格空间和地图分析）、目的地助手代理（提供精细导航）和本地发现代理（利用图像嵌入和RAG应对行程中断）。

Result: 系统在查询解析、导航精度和抗干扰能力方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该系统在从城市探索到应急响应等应用中具有广阔前景。

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving
them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving
environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper,
we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating
user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter"
navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative
agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and
map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination
Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation
leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image
embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to
trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system
demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation
accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications
from urban exploration to emergency response.

Motivation: RLVR在提升LLM推理能力时存在探索不稳定的问题。

Method: 提出FR3E框架，通过识别高不确定性决策点并进行针对性探索，构建语义基础的中途反馈。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，FR3E提升了训练稳定性、回答长度和连贯性，并增加了完全正确轨迹的比例。

Conclusion: FR3E通过更稳健和结构化的探索，有效提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but it struggles with unstable
exploration. We propose FR3E (First Return, Entropy-Eliciting Explore), a
structured exploration framework that identifies high-uncertainty decision
points in reasoning trajectories and performs targeted rollouts to construct
semantically grounded intermediate feedback. Our method provides targeted
guidance without relying on dense supervision. Empirical results on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks(AIME24) show that FR3E promotes more stable
training, produces longer and more coherent responses, and increases the
proportion of fully correct trajectories. These results highlight the
framework's effectiveness in improving LLM reasoning through more robust and
structured exploration.
