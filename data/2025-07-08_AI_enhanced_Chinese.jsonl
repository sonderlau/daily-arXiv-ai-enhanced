To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes LLM-SAEA, a novel approach that integrates large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to configure both surrogate models and infill sampling\ncriteria online. Specifically, LLM-SAEA develops a collaboration-of-experts\nframework, where one LLM serves as a scoring expert (LLM-SE), assigning scores\nto surrogate models and infill sampling criteria based on their optimization\nperformance, while another LLM acts as a decision expert (LLM-DE), selecting\nthe appropriate configurations by analyzing their scores along with the current\noptimization state. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-SAEA outperforms\nseveral state-of-the-art algorithms across standard test cases.

With advancements in spiking neural network\n(SNN) training methods, low-latency SNN applications have expanded. In\nlow-latency SNNs, shorter simulation steps render traditional refractory\nmechanisms, which rely on empirical distributions or spike firing rates, less\neffective. However, omitting the refractory period amplifies the risk of neuron\nover-activation and reduces the system's robustness to noise. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a historical dynamic refractory period (HDRP) model that\nleverages membrane potential derivative with historical refractory periods to\nestimate an initial refractory period and dynamically adjust its duration.\nAdditionally, we propose a threshold-dependent refractory kernel to mitigate\nexcessive neuron state accumulation.

Mitigating UHIs requires urban planners to first\nestimate how urban heat is influenced by different land use types (LUTs) and\ndrivers across scales - from synoptic-scale climatic background processes to\nsmall-scale urban- and scale-bridging features.

However, existing structured\nprompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings,\nand often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking\ncritical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in\nmulti-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce\nCodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and\nenables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In\nCodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system\nroles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode\nenriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic,\nand typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into\ncohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We\nevaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA,\nHotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show\nconsistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36\npercentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome,\nour method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition,\nour approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%,\nrespectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in\nthe development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

In long-term planning tasks,\nhowever, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient\nbehavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular\nactor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a\ntrajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).\nOur setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the\nguarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural\nlanguage observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes\nnew LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient\nbehavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety\nconstraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term\nefficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve\nas the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper.

Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos.

In this work, we draw inspiration from adaptive and\nstructured dynamics observed in biological neural systems and introduce the\nAdaptive Unitary State Space Model (AUSSM)- a novel class of SSMs that\nleverages skew-symmetric, input-dependent recurrence to achieve unitary\nevolution and high expressive power.

However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the\nsafety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to\nuncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this\nwork, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk\nprediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing\nhigh-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based\nmotion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,\nother vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize\nplug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call\nDriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation\nframework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel\ninformation injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and\ntrajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial\nrelationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our\nDriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction\nperformance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy\nsoaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation\non an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a\nsignificant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to\n68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in\nreal-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faBEV\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cDriveMRP-Agent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u6545\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9884\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eBEV\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6570\u636eDriveMRP-10K\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1VLM\u65e0\u5173\u7684DriveMRP-Agent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u81ea\u8f66\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6295\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cDriveMRP-Agent\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347VLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e8b\u6545\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece27.13%\u63d0\u5347\u81f388.03%\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4ece29.42%\u63d0\u5347\u81f368.50%\u3002", "conclusion": "DriveMRP-10K\u548cDriveMRP-Agent\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aVLM\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Zero-shot unstructured iSelf-Discover variants are also\nshown to outperform their five-shot structured counterparts, underscoring the\nsignificance of this gap, even when structured plans are dynamically generated\nto ensure reasoning precedes the final answer. We further demonstrate that the\noptimal granularity of plan generation (instance-level vs. task-level) is\ncontext-dependent.

However, as these\nmodels scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the\nquadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental\ncomputational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where\nattention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them,\nleading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the\nCompressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that\nreimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By\nprojecting high dimensional key and value representations into a\nlower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing\nthe attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly\nreduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to\nvLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual\nrepresentations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,\nand in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to\nLLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit\nfrom structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them\nparticularly well-suited to compressed attention.

However, traditional approaches rely\non human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often\noverlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other\nmulti-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory\nSynergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language\nmodels as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and\nphenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of\nconcept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --\nspanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which\nspontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,\nself-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical\ncorrelations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for\nphenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's\ncapabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the\nheart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging\nphenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional\nconfounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on\ndiagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve\nperformance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences\nas small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks.

However, the concepts are\nfrequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy\ndiscourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain\nunder meaningful human supervision.\n  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision\noutside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to\nAI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and\noperational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either\na policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims\nto prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,\nremediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight\nstrategies nonetheless necessitate control.\n  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a\ntheoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the\nconditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and\nwhat is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how\nsupervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,\nand drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a\nmaturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some\nboundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,\nand where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the\nquestion of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment\ncontext, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying\nboth present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical\nadvances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u533a\u5206\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u660e\u786e\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u672f\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e2d\u5e38\u6df7\u6dc6\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6216\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u53d7\u963b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u533a\u5206\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\u5c40\u9650\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been\nproposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods\nusually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy\nfunction, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the\npossible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible\nassignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN\nremains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features\nwith an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper\nproposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with\ninfinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:\n(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call\nassignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment\ngraphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that\ncan learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.\nTo evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal\nassignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space\ndimensionalities.

While cross-attention models achieve\nstrong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic\ncomplexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this\nchallenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures\nthe power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent\npipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving\nmultimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion\nblock built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric\ncross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming\nmodality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit\n(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,\nenabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,\nrecurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it\nideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark\ndemonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex\nbaselines.

However, current methods\npredominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning,\nfailing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches.\nFurthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a\nsingle reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse\ndemands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic\nmethods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as\nthere is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural\nnetworks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and\nspecific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified\nneurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first\nintroduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query\nentity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching\nposterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is\nproposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as\nwell as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In\nthis way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by\nmerging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is\nproposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations\nover the reasoning graph.

However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn\nactivity.

In\nthis paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based\nQuestion-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine\nthe automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in\nquestions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on\nseveral benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these\ndeficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and\nLlama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving\ndeficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as\nzero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the\nmodel now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)\ndecides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)\ndetermines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers\nthe resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without\nthe use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents\nwith transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An\nimprovement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies\nin the question.

To facilitate this approach, we introduce the Dark\nSouls API (DSAPI), a novel Python framework leveraging real-time computer\nvision techniques for extracting critical game metrics, including player and\nenemy health states. Using NEAT, agents evolve effective combat strategies for\ndefeating the Asylum Demon, the game's initial boss, without predefined\nbehaviors or domain-specific heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that\nevolved agents achieve up to a 35% success rate, indicating the viability of\nneuroevolution in addressing complex, visually intricate gameplay scenarios.\nThis work represents an interesting application of vision-based neuroevolution,\nhighlighting its potential use in a wide range of challenging game environments\nlacking direct API support or well-defined state representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528NEAT\u7b97\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u300a\u9ed1\u6697\u4e4b\u9b42\u300b\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u50cf\u7d20\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6e38\u620f\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8fdb\u5316\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u51fb\u8d25\u521d\u59cbBoss\u65f6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe35%\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22NEAT\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5API\u652f\u6301\u6216\u660e\u786e\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528NEAT\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u50cf\u7d20\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Dark Souls API\uff08DSAPI\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u6e38\u620f\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8fdb\u5316\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u51fb\u8d25Asylum Demon\u65f6\u8fbe\u523035%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8fdb\u5316\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6e38\u620f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5API\u652f\u6301\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

This can\nerode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable\ndetectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising\ncues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the\ninherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose\nLATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the\nevolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling\nthe trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE\ncaptures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated\nimages. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature\nrefinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it\nis fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight\nclassifier.

In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing\nVLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,\nand a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically\nanalyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals\npsychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,\nwe investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size\ninfluence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated\nquestions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit\nstronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting\nincreasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human\nsubject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural\ndifferences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new\nperspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the\nimportance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The\nbenchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5AIpsych\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u503e\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6280\u672f\u9650\u5236\u6216\u5949\u627f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1AIpsych\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\uff0cVLMs\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5949\u627f\u503e\u5411\u4f46\u6743\u5a01\u504f\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u4f46\u54cd\u5e94\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3VLMs\u5e7b\u89c9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5c06\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u539f\u5219\u7eb3\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper argues that recent advances in neural\nnetworks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --\nrepresent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an\nexisting experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules\nformulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging\nempirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior\nas models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),\nwhich have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same\ntask. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions\nabout the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to\ncomplete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere\nimplementation of the pLoT solution.

Inspired by Real-Time Bidding (RTB)\nsystems in online advertising, AEX serves as the central auction engine,\nfacilitating interactions among four ecosystem components: the User-Side\nPlatform (USP), which translates human goals into agent-executable tasks; the\nAgent-Side Platform (ASP), responsible for capability representation,\nperformance tracking, and optimization; Agent Hubs, which coordinate agent\nteams and participate in AEX-hosted auctions; and the Data Management Platform\n(DMP), ensuring secure knowledge sharing and fair value attribution. We outline\nthe design principles and system architecture of AEX, laying the groundwork for\nagent-based economic infrastructure in future AI ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faAgent Exchange (AEX)\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3aAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u62cd\u5356\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u4ea4\u6362\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cAI\u4ee3\u7406\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u5de5\u5177\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u652f\u6301\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "method": "AEX\u501f\u9274\u5728\u7ebf\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ade\u4ef7\uff08RTB\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u4e2d\u592e\u62cd\u5356\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u7528\u6237\u4fa7\u5e73\u53f0\uff08USP\uff09\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u4fa7\u5e73\u53f0\uff08ASP\uff09\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08Agent Hubs\uff09\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\uff08DMP\uff09\u3002", "result": "AEX\u4e3aAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7ecf\u6d4e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "AEX\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature\nextractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is\ndesigned to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial\ninformation learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR\ncovariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first\ndynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and\npixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature\ninteraction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the\nclassification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected\ndistillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of\ndifferent frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency\ndata. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher\nmodel to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to\nlearn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of\ndual-frequency data on different terrain objects.

Our analysis reveals that\ncertain visual concepts -- such as spatial relationships and shapes -- benefit\nmore from optimization than others, suggesting that existing benchmarks\nsystematically underestimate model performance in these categories.\nAdditionally, we find strong cross-model transferability of optimized prompts,\nindicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing across models.\nThese findings demonstrate that rigid benchmarking approaches may significantly\nunderrepresent true model capabilities, while our framework provides more\naccurate assessment and insights for future development.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConceptMix++\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f4e\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ConceptMix++\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u9988\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5982\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\uff09\u53d7\u76ca\u66f4\u591a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f4e\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff0cConceptMix++\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger\nsets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant\nunlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)\nor large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions\nfrom those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution\n(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can\nlead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In\nthis paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework\nwith an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize\nunlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets\ndemonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves\nthe performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and\n(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD\nimages leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS\noutperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,\nrespectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes\nabundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks.

Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning\nstrategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they\npredominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous\nmulti-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key\nchallenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling\nmodels trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target\ndistributions within the same modality set.

These methods often exhibit randomness\nduring generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to\nconsider inter-modal consistency.

To enhance the robustness of translation averaging, we incorporate\nboth camera-to-camera and camera-to-point constraints to initialize camera\npositions and 3D points with a convex distance-based objective function and\nrefine them with an unbiased non-bilinear angle-based objective function.\nExperiments on large-scale datasets show that our system matches or exceeds\nincremental SfM accuracy while significantly improving efficiency.

It is typically applied\nwhen access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world\nscenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information,\nsuch as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising\nsolution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA),\nwhich enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target\ndomain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address\ndomain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality\nof prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases.\nIn the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to\nimprove the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples.

However, effectively navigating\ncomplex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced\ntrajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed\nself-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from\nreal-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches\nencounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where\nreal or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic\nfeedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and\n(2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can\ninvolve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and\ncomputational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable\nself-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for\ntrajectory synthesis and training.

The former treats all temporal information of each variable as\na token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,\nwhile the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each\ntime step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current\nmainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.\nTransformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention\nmechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and\nsuffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in\nlong-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models\n(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but\nstruggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome\nthe limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel\nforecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series\nforecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a\nchannel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the\nTransformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model\ncross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two\ndistinct feature representations via separate embedding layers.

Previous work has mainly\nrelied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and\nunobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal\nrelationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked\nTemporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space\ntemporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages\na learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features,\nthereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By\nintegrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end\ntraining tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the\nmodel's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally,\nwe introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action\ngeneration space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to\nprioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end\nstates over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out\ntask-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action\nsequences.

An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL\ncorpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all\nmentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.\nThis imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body\nrepresentation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose\nLumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through\nthree mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss\n(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head\nover-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail\nRecommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to\nguide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a\nGPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically\ngenerates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity\nand distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly\nimprove recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and\nINSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over\nfifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,\ninformativeness, and long-tail relevance.

(b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on\nover-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the\nimportance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of\n0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on\nthe LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the\nTMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple\nscore-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model\nimproved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused\nwith BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B\ndataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset.

However, current approaches face\na critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional\ncorrectness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods\nbased on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but\nPPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In\ncontrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after\ngeneration are often inefficient because they operate externally without\nupdating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic\ndesign capabilities.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven\nreinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that\nachieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1\nemploys a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on\nsyntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from\nsynthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn\ncomplex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code\nthat is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on\nstandard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results\nin functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1\ngenerated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original\nhuman-written code.

However, these\nrationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to\nwasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe\nthat verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct\nregions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and\ninjecting a \"steering vector\" to transition between these modes, we can\nreliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively\ncompressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as\nActivation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens\nreasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we\nprovide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,\nderived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate\nsteering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC\nachieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,\nwhile maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a\ntraining-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on\nMATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock\ntime on an 8B model.

Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most\neffective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke\nclassification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism,\nallowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the\noriginal CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional\ndiagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for\nimproving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques,\nthis study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically\nconcerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan\nimages. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke\ndetection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing\nclassification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced\noptimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201,\nInceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature\nextraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including\nBFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further.

To overcome this\nfundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that\nelevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our\nframework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,\nincorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial\nDisentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual\ndescriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's\nfeatures to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns\na representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time\nCausal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM\ninterprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation\ndecoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction.

However, existing models typically produce\nonly short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and\nreal-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing\nStreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on\nflow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with\ndifferent partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content\nconsistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with\nvarying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,\nwe train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a\nmultistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is\nperformed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,\nthe total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of\nchunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance\nat 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution.

As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe\nhaze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely\nfrom visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of\ndual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and\nrich texture details.

However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on\nmodeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,\nneglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every\nsensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and\nnon-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity\nclassification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a\ncasual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation\nlearning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an\nearly-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are\nrespectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an\nindependence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to\nimplicitly disentangling them.

Existing low-light enhancement methods often\nstruggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to\nconsider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art\nmethods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative\nsolutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color\ndistortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework\n(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting\nconditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an\nilluminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a\nspecialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition\nfield establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light\nconditions.

The quadratic\ncomputational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a\nlarge window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low\ncomputational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel\nprompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the\nproposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information\naccess and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global\nanchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL\nleverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor\nprompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used\nto provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token\nconnections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention\nand window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional\nglobal prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different\ngranularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB\neffectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging\nthe receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our\nPromptSR.

Since the scene is changing over time, different generated views need\nto be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. While previous works learn\nsuch consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions\nare bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To\naddress this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic\nscene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D\noutpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D\npixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input\nwith the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the\nray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to\na dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths.

Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their\nreliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of\ndiscriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language\n(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as\na promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely\nunexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only\none simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn\nfine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and\nvisual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.\nSecond, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking\nthe intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective\nmodeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a\nnovel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved\nsurvival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors\nto generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region\nlevels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various\nsurvival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features\nvia Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL).

To solve these issues, this paper proposes\nRegistrationMamba, a novel Mamba architecture based on state space models\n(SSMs) integrating multi-expert feature learning for improving the accuracy of\nCRSI registration. Specifically, RegistrationMamba employs a multi-directional\ncross-scanning strategy to capture global contextual relationships with linear\ncomplexity. To enhance the performance of RegistrationMamba under\ntexture-limited scenarios, we propose a multi-expert feature learning (MEFL)\nstrategy to capture features from various augmented image variants through\nmultiple feature experts. MEFL leverages a learnable soft router to dynamically\nfuse the features from multiple experts, thereby enriching feature\nrepresentations and improving registration performance. Notably, MEFL can be\nseamlessly integrated into various frameworks, substantially boosting\nregistration performance. Additionally, RegistrationMamba integrates a\nmulti-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to extract fine-grained local\ninformation and enable effective interaction between global and local features.\nExtensive experiments on CRSI with varying image resolutions have demonstrated\nthat RegistrationMamba has superior performance and robustness compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSMs\uff09\u7684RegistrationMamba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\uff08CRSI\uff09\u914d\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f90\u5c04\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "CRSI\u914d\u51c6\u9762\u4e34\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f90\u5c04\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982CNN\u548cTransformer\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u6216\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u4ea4\u53c9\u626b\u63cf\u7b56\u7565\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MEFL\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\uff08MFA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u8fa8\u7387CRSI\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRegistrationMamba\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RegistrationMamba\u901a\u8fc7SSMs\u548c\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86CRSI\u914d\u51c6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94%\naccuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion\ndifferentiation and clinical interpretability.

Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on\nvision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.\nThis study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both\ntraining and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate\nCVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily\nadapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label\nframework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a\nsignificant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose\nCVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,\nbinary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with\ntextual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.\nBy adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the\nEndoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the\nResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that\nCVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,\nboosts CVS recognition over image-only methods.

Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack\nflexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce\nMML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural\nlanguage supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of\npartial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we\nemploy Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces\nannotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.\nOur framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical\ntasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete\nor noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a\ncombined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50,\nutilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt\nperforms comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of\nhandling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks\nfor the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a\nmore scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the\nannotation burden on clinicians.

To better understand the\nvulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we\nconduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain.

First, we compute the implicit token-wise\nclassification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score\naggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on\nthe tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is\nmore likely to be involved in the training set.

However, real-world data collection is often biased toward\ncommon scenes and objects, leaving novel cases underrepresented. This imbalance\nhinders model generalization and compromises safety. The core issue is the\ncurse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard\nlogging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of\nredundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to\nbiased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused\non object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets.\nThe method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel\ndynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and\ncovariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those\nwith redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training\ndataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher\nredundancy tends to degrade it. Moreover, as data redundancy increases, more\naggressive filtering becomes both possible and beneficial.

In 3D VQA, the\nfree-form nature of answers often leads to improper annotations that can\nconfuse or mislead models when training on the entire dataset. While other text\ngeneration tasks can mitigate this issue by learning on large-scale datasets,\nthe scarcity of 3D scene data enlarges the negative effect of misleading\nannotations. Although active learning strategies can select valuable instances\nfor training, they fail to identify and resolve misleading labels, which the\noracle inevitably provides in practice. To address this issue, we propose a\nmulti-turn interactive active learning strategy. This strategy selects data\nbased on models' semantic uncertainty to form a solid knowledge foundation more\neffectively and actively requests reannotation from an oracle to resolve\npotentially misleading labels.

This uncertainty is\nparticularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame\nloss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above\nchallenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model\nfor multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise\ninterference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both\nlocal and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their\ndependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph\nrepresentation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local\ncues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the\nexpressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated\nembeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an\nuncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples\nto experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses\nnoise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design\nan uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction,\nimproving the performance.

Unlike the traditional\napproaches of manually assessing post-disaster damage, analyzing images of\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers an objective and reliable way to assess\nthe damage. In the past, segmentation techniques have been adopted to identify\npost-flood damage in UAV aerial images. However, most of these supervised\nlearning approaches rely on manually annotated datasets.

This work proposes two\nencoder-decoder-based segmentation approaches, which integrate the visual\nfeatures learned from DINOv2 with the traditional encoder backbone. This study\ninvestigates the generalization of self-supervised features for UAV aerial\nimages.

Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and\nvideo-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based\ndiffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively\ninefficient compared to non-diffusion methods.

Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus\non constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of\nhuman-labelled data.

However, the uneven global distribution of healthcare\nresources often results in real-world clinical scenarios encountering\nincomplete multimodal data, which significantly compromises diagnostic\naccuracy. Existing commonly used pipelines, such as modality imputation and\ndistillation methods, face notable limitations: 1)Imputation methods struggle\nwith accurately reconstructing key lesion features, since OCT lesions are\nlocalized, while fundus images vary in style. 2)distillation methods rely\nheavily on fully paired multimodal training data. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel multimodal alignment and fusion framework capable of\nrobustly handling missing modalities in the task of ophthalmic diagnostics.

LiMA\nmaintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational\noverhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream\nLiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves\nboth LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection.
