### [1] [Finding optimal Noah-MP parameterizations for the characterization of surface heat fluxes in the Iberian Peninsula](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26421)
*David Donaire-Montaño,Matilde García-Valdecasas Ojeda,Nicolás Tacoronte,Juan José Rosa-Cánovas,Yolanda Castro-Díez,María Jesús Esteban-Parra,Sonia Raquel Gámiz-Fortis*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 优化了Noah-MP陆面模型在伊比利亚半岛的配置，通过70次模拟确定了最佳参数组合，能够较好地模拟土壤湿度和地表热通量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 陆面模型在表征陆气相互作用中起关键作用，特别是在水限制的伊比利亚半岛地区，需要优化Noah-MP模型配置以准确表征热通量。

Method: 使用WRF v3.9.1作为区域气候模型，进行了70次为期一年的模拟，测试35种Noah-MP参数组合，针对干旱年(2005)和湿润年(2010)，并与FLUXNET站点数据和CERRA-Land再分析数据进行比较。

Result: WRF/Noah-MP总体上能很好地再现伊比利亚半岛的土壤湿度和地表热通量，特别是在湿润条件下。通过聚类分析确定了10个组别中的最优配置，其中实验s27I表现最佳。

Conclusion: 确定了Noah-MP模型中影响最大的参数选项，并找到了特别适合伊比利亚半岛热通量表征的最优配置组合。

Abstract: Land surface models (LSMs) play a crucial role in characterizing
land-atmosphere interactions by providing boundary conditions to regional
climate models (RCMs). This is particularly true over the Iberian Peninsula
(IP), where a water-limited regime governs much of the territory. We optimize
the configuration of the Noah land surface model with multiparameterization
options (Noah-MP) for characterizing heat fluxes in the IP when the Weather
Research and Forecasting (WRF) model v3.9.1 is used as an RCM. We perform 70
one-year simulations using 35 Noah-MP combinations, for a dry year (2005) and a
wet year (2010). Land-surface heat fluxes and soil moisture from WRF/Noah-MP
are evaluated against FLUXNET station data and the CERRA-Land reanalysis. In
general, WRF/Noah-MP reproduces soil moisture and surface heat fluxes well over
the IP, especially under wetter conditions. Clustering identifies an optimal
configuration from 10 groups (A to J). The Noah-MP options with greatest impact
are canopy stomatal resistance (CRS), surface exchange coefficient for heat
(SFC), soil-moisture factor controlling stomatal resistance (BTR), runoff and
groundwater (RUN), and surface resistance to evaporation/sublimation (RSF);
dynamic vegetation (DVEG) also matters. Several configurations performed
reasonably; experiment s27I (Jarvis CRS, Chen97 SFC, CLM-type BTR, BATS RUN,
and adjusted Sellers RSF for wet soils) provides a particularly good
characterization of heat fluxes over the IP.

### [2] [Fire Behavior Monitoring using MeteoSat Third Generation, FCI-FireDyn algorithm: Rate Of Spread and Burnt Area Dynamics for large fire event](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26677)
*Ronan Paugam,Akli Benali,Julia Harvie,Andrea Meraner,Niels Andela,Weidong Xu*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: FCI-FireDyn算法利用Meteosat第三代卫星的FCI传感器，通过10分钟高时间分辨率观测，以175米空间分辨率和2分钟时间间隔监测野火动态，包括火线到达时间、蔓延速率和燃烧面积演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够实时监测野火动态的高频算法，支持业务化应用和火灾建模，利用地球静止卫星的高时间分辨率优势。

Method: 结合基于阈值的中波红外检测和时空插值方法，重建火线推进和蔓延速率场，空间分辨率达175米。

Result: 在南欧三个重大火灾事件中测试，与EFFIS、Copernicus EMS和PT-FireSprd参考数据集相比，总最终燃烧面积偏差低于20%，成功捕捉了火势传播的不同阶段。

Conclusion: FCI-FireDyn证明了从地球静止观测中获取高频火灾行为指标的概念可行性，尽管受FCI空间分辨率限制，但仍能提供足够的时空覆盖来估计火线尺度的火灾动态。

Abstract: This study presents FCI-FireDyn, a new algorithm developed to monitor
wildfire dynamics using the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) onboard the Meteosat
Third Generation satellite. Leveraging the high temporal resolution of FCI
(10-minute full-disk observations), the algorithm derives fire arrival time
maps, rate of spread (ROS), and Burn Area (BA) evolution at sub-kilometer
spatial resolution and 2-minute temporal intervals. The method combines
threshold-based MWIR detection, spatio-temporal interpolation to reconstruct
fire front progression and ROS fields at 175 m resolution. FCI-FireDyn was
tested on three major fire events in Southern Europe (Portugal, Greece, and
France) from the 2024 2025 seasons. The retrieved BA and Fire Growth Rate show
good agreement with reference datasets from EFFIS, Copernicus EMS, and
PT-FireSprd, with total final BA deviations below 20%. The algorithm captures
distinct propagation phases, including acceleration episodes that precede FRP
peaks, highlighting a potential for NRT fire behavior monitoring. Despite
limitations due to FCI spatial resolution, results demonstrate that it provides
sufficient spatio-temporal coverage to estimate front-scale fire dynamics.
FCI-FireDyn thus represents a proof of concept for deriving high-frequency fire
behavior metrics from geostationary observations to support operational and
modeling applications.

Conclusion: VDSP为基于忆阻器的边缘AI设备提供了一种高效的无监督学习方法，具有良好的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The deployment of AI on edge computing devices faces significant challenges
related to energy consumption and functionality. These devices could greatly
benefit from brain-inspired learning mechanisms, allowing for real-time
adaptation while using low-power. In-memory computing with nanoscale resistive
memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of AI workloads on
these edge devices. In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic
plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning
in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online
learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary
for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be
advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO$_2$,
HfO$_2$-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO$_4$-based
ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching
characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks
incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on
MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
The results demonstrated over 83% accuracy across all devices using 200
neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as
switching thresholds and ratios between high and low resistance state levels,
and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.

### [4] [Advancing Forest Fires Classification using Neurochaos Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26383)
*Kunal Kumar Pant,Remya Ajai A S,Nithin Nagaraj*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出使用神经混沌学习（NL）算法进行森林火灾分类，该算法基于混沌理论并受大脑启发，能在小样本训练下取得优于传统机器学习和深度学习模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习和深度学习模型在森林火灾预测中准确率不足，无法有效捕捉自然界的非线性模式，且需要大量训练数据。神经混沌学习算法能够解决这些问题。

Method: 使用神经混沌学习（NL）算法，特别是随机异构神经混沌学习（RHNL），采用一维混沌映射（广义Lüroth序列）作为神经元，模拟人脑的随机性和异质性。

Result: 在阿尔及利亚森林火灾数据集上获得最佳F1分数1.0，在加拿大和葡萄牙数据集上分别获得0.90和0.68的高精度分数，在小样本训练场景下表现优于传统ML和DL模型。

Conclusion: 神经混沌学习架构在森林火灾分类任务中比传统机器学习分类器表现更好，具有开发更高效可靠森林火灾检测系统的潜力。

Abstract: Forest fires are among the most dangerous and unpredictable natural disasters
worldwide. Forest fire can be instigated by natural causes or by humans. They
are devastating overall, and thus, many research efforts have been carried out
to predict whether a fire can occur in an area given certain environmental
variables. Many research works employ Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning
(DL) models for classification; however, their accuracy is merely adequate and
falls short of expectations. This limit arises because these models are unable
to depict the underlying nonlinearity in nature and extensively rely on
substantial training data, which is hard to obtain. We propose using Neurochaos
Learning (NL), a chaos-based, brain-inspired learning algorithm for forest fire
classification. Like our brains, NL needs less data to learn nonlinear patterns
in the training data. It employs one-dimensional chaotic maps, namely the
Generalized L\"uroth Series (GLS), as neurons. NL yields comparable performance
with ML and DL models, sometimes even surpassing them, particularly in
low-sample training regimes, and unlike deep neural networks, NL is
interpretable as it preserves causal structures in the data. Random
Heterogenous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL), a type of NL where different chaotic
neurons are randomnly located to mimic the randomness and heterogeneity of
human brain gives the best F1 score of 1.0 for the Algerian Forest Fires
Dataset. Compared to other traditional ML classifiers considered, RHNL also
gives high precision score of 0.90 for Canadian Forest Fires Dataset and 0.68
for Portugal Forest Fires Dataset. The results obtained from this work indicate
that Neurochaos Learning (NL) architectures achieve better performance than
conventional machine learning classifiers, highlighting their promise for
developing more efficient and reliable forest fire detection systems.

### [5] [Wireless Sensor Networks as Parallel and Distributed Hardware Platform for Artificial Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26492)
*Gursel Serpen*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无线传感器网络的完全并行和最大分布式的神经计算系统硬件实现方案，用于实时计算大规模复杂问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于硅基或光基计算无法实现人工神经网络的并行分布式计算，阻碍了神经网络在大规模实时问题中的应用，需要开发专用计算方案

Method: 利用具有板载处理和无线通信功能的无线传感器网络节点作为处理单元，实现人工神经网络算法的完全并行和大量分布式计算

Result: 成功展示了如何用数十万个处理节点网络实现人工神经网络算法的并行分布式计算，为大规模实时问题提供解决方案

Conclusion: 这种实现将彻底改变现有计算方式，使实时解决超大规模科学、工程和技术问题成为可能

Abstract: We are proposing fully parallel and maximally distributed hardware
realization of a generic neuro-computing system. More specifically, the
proposal relates to the wireless sensor networks technology to serve as a
massively parallel and fully distributed hardware platform to implement and
realize artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. A parallel and distributed
(PDP) hardware realization of ANNs makes it possible to have real time
computation of large-scale (and complex) problems in a highly robust framework.
We will demonstrate how a network of hundreds of thousands of processing nodes
(or motes of a wireless sensor network), which have on-board processing and
wireless communication features, can be used to implement fully parallel and
massively distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms for
solution of truly large-scale problems in real time. The realization of
artificial neural network algorithms in a massively parallel and fully
distributed hardware has been the goal of neural network computing researchers.
This is because a parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural
network algorithms could not have been achieved against all the advancements in
silicon- or optics-based computing. Accordingly, artificial neural networks
could not be applied to very large-scale problems for real time computation of
solutions. This hindered the development of neural algorithms for affordable
and practical solutions of challenging problems since often special-purpose
computing approaches in hardware, software or hybrid (non-neural) had to be
developed for and fine-tuned to specific problems that are very large-scale and
highly complex. Successful implementation is likely to revolutionize computing
as we know it by making it possible to solve very large scale scientific,
engineering or technical problems in real time.

### [6] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了时空建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习水下目标检测中的有效性，比较了YOLOv5、T-YOLOv5和带CBAM的T-YOLOv5的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在提高水下目标检测在动态海洋环境中的准确性，特别是在突然运动、部分遮挡和渐进运动等挑战性条件下的检测可靠性。

Method: 第一阶段评估了T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能；第二阶段开发了带卷积块注意力模块（CBAM）的增强版T-YOLOv5。

Result: YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，T-YOLOv5和带CBAM的T-YOLOv5分别达到0.813和0.811，显示出更高的检测精度和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T-YOLOv5相比标准模型显著提高了检测可靠性，带CBAM的T-YOLOv5在挑战性场景中性能更优，但在简单场景中精度有所损失。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [7] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练期间直接让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，而不是事后处理，显著提高了生成图像的视觉质量并加速了训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在大规模未筛选数据集上训练以实现多样化生成，但这与用户偏好不一致。现有的奖励模型通过事后选择来对齐用户偏好，但这会损害多样性、语义保真度和效率。

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练期间让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，直接学习用户偏好，而不是进行事后处理。

Result: MIRO在GenEval组合基准和用户偏好评分（PickAScore、ImageReward、HPSv2）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过在训练中直接学习多个奖励模型的条件，MIRO方法不仅显著提高了生成图像的视觉质量，还大大加快了训练速度。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文开发了针对自行车的3D LiDAR分割方法，创建了BikeScenes-lidarseg数据集，通过领域特定训练显著提升了分割性能（mIoU从13.8%提升到63.6%）。

Motivation: 随着电动自行车日益普及，骑行者面临的安全风险增加，需要将汽车感知技术适配到自行车安全领域。

Method: 使用多传感器'SenseBike'研究平台，开发针对自行车的3D LiDAR分割方法，并创建包含3021个连续LiDAR扫描的BikeScenes-lidarseg数据集，标注29个动态和静态类别。

Result: 在BikeScenes数据集上微调的模型达到63.6%的mIoU，显著优于仅使用SemanticKITTI预训练的13.8%结果。

Conclusion: 领域特定训练对于自行车感知系统至关重要，BikeScenes数据集为以骑行者为中心的LiDAR分割研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的STM图像修复和超分辨率方法，通过物理信息合成数据生成训练模型，有效恢复图像质量并减少图像采集时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决STM技术中针尖退化和串行数据采集速度慢的问题，提高实验通量并减少针尖调节频率。

Method: 使用36张原始Si(001):H实验图像，通过物理信息合成数据生成管道训练流匹配和扩散模型。

Result: 模型能够有效修复图像，通过稀疏采样数据准确重建图像，实现2-4倍的图像采集时间减少。

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力显著提高STM实验通量，减少针尖调节频率并增强现有高速STM系统的帧率。

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流分解与聚合的免反演图像编辑框架，通过语义分解目标提示词、独立计算子流并自适应聚合来解决现有方法在图像编辑中的反演不准确和梯度纠缠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有整流流模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但在图像编辑任务中存在关键限制：反演过程不准确导致真实图像映射到潜在空间困难，编辑过程中的梯度纠缠问题使得输出无法忠实反映目标提示词。

Method: 采用流分解与聚合框架，将目标提示词语义分解为多个子提示词，为每个子提示词计算独立流，然后通过投影和软聚合机制自适应加权子目标速度场，抑制语义冗余并强调不同方向。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在语义保真度和属性解耦方面优于现有的零样本编辑方法。

Conclusion: 提出的流分解与聚合框架有效解决了图像编辑中的反演不准确和梯度纠缠问题，在保持多样性的同时确保了编辑结果的一致性。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/SplitFlow.

*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Brain-IT方法，通过大脑交互Transformer从fMRI脑记录重建视觉图像，在有限数据下实现更忠实和高效的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的方法在从fMRI重建视觉图像时缺乏对实际所见图像的忠实度，需要更有效的大脑-图像映射方法。

Method: 使用Brain Interaction Transformer(BIT)，通过功能性相似脑体素簇的交互，预测互补的局部图像特征：高层次语义特征和低层次结构特征，指导扩散模型重建。

Result: 方法在视觉和客观指标上都超越了当前最先进方法，仅用1小时fMRI数据就能达到与40小时数据训练方法相当的效果。

Conclusion: Brain-IT通过大脑启发的功能簇交互和互补特征预测，实现了更忠实的fMRI图像重建，显著提高了数据效率。

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在数据稀缺约束下对胸腹部区域cine-MRI序列进行实时肿瘤跟踪的挑战

Method: 采用SAM 2.1 b+基础模型，使用第一张标注切片的掩码提示，在TrackRAD2025小规模标注数据上进行微调，使用平衡Dice+IoU损失函数

Result: 在隐藏测试集上达到Dice分数0.8794，在TrackRAD2025挑战中排名第6

Conclusion: 基础模型在MRI引导放疗中实现准确实时肿瘤跟踪方面具有强大潜力

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

TL;DR: CAVE是首个真实世界视觉异常基准，支持异常描述、解释和论证三个开放任务，通过认知科学启发的细粒度标注评估视觉语言模型在异常感知和常识推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机视觉中的异常检测主要局限于工业缺陷或合成异常，无法捕捉真实世界异常的丰富性和不可预测性。人类能够自然识别、推理和解释环境中的异常，这一能力在现有研究中尚未得到充分体现。

Method: 构建CAVE基准，包含真实世界视觉异常数据，提供基于认知科学的细粒度标注，包括视觉定位、异常类型分类、复杂性、严重性和常见性评估，支持三种开放任务评估。

Result: 实验表明，即使采用先进的提示策略，最先进的视觉语言模型在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面仍存在困难。

Conclusion: CAVE为推进异常检测和视觉语言模型中的常识推理研究提供了真实且认知基础扎实的基准资源。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级CNN模型，用于预测不同海平面上升情景下的沿海洪水淹没情况，在阿布扎比和旧金山两个不同地理区域的数据集上验证了模型的泛化能力，平均减少预测洪水深度图的平均绝对误差近20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化和海平面上升对沿海城市构成日益严重的威胁，传统物理模拟器计算成本高昂，深度学习技术面临数据稀缺和高维输出等挑战，需要开发高效准确的洪水预测方法。

Method: 利用基于视觉的低资源深度学习框架，开发了轻量级卷积神经网络模型，能够预测不同海平面上升预测和海岸线适应情景下的沿海洪水。

Result: 该模型在两个不同地理区域（阿布扎比和旧金山）的数据集上显著优于现有最先进方法，将预测洪水深度图的平均绝对误差平均降低了近20%。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力成为沿海洪水管理的可扩展实用工具，帮助决策者制定有效的缓解策略以应对气候变化日益增长的影响。

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出了一种在视觉编码器中引入堆叠时序注意力模块的Video-LLM架构，显著提升了视频时序理解能力，在多个基准测试中性能提升达5.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在理解复杂视频时序动态方面存在严重局限，特别是在需要详细理解动作序列和时序进展的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 在视觉编码器内部引入堆叠时序注意力模块，通过时序注意力机制使模型能够更好地捕捉动作进展和帧间关系，然后再将视觉标记传递给LLM。

Result: 该方法显著改善了时序推理能力，在视频问答任务特别是动作识别方面优于现有模型，在VITATECS、MVBench和Video-MME等基准测试上提升达5.5%。

Conclusion: 通过增强视觉编码器的时序结构，解决了Video-LLMs在视频理解方面的关键差距。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexICL是一种新颖的灵活上下文学习框架，用于超声图像中骨骼区域的分割，在仅使用5%训练图像的情况下，在四个手腕和肘部超声数据集上实现了稳健的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿科人群中肘部和手腕骨折是最常见的骨折。超声图像中肌肉骨骼结构的自动分割可以提高诊断准确性和治疗规划。骨折表现为皮质缺损但需要专家解读。深度学习可以提供实时反馈并突出关键结构，帮助训练较少的用户更自信地进行检查。然而，用于训练的像素级专家注释仍然耗时且昂贵。

Method: 提出FlexICL框架，应用于视频内分割设置，专家仅注释少量帧，模型分割未见过的帧。系统研究了各种图像拼接技术和视觉上下文学习的训练策略，引入了新颖的拼接方法，在有限标记数据下显著提高模型性能。通过整合多种增强策略实现稳健分割。

Result: 在1,252个超声扫描中，FlexICL在Dice系数上比最先进的视觉上下文学习模型（如Painter、MAE-VQGAN）和传统分割模型（如U-Net、TransUNet）高出1-27%。

Conclusion: 这些初步结果突显了FlexICL作为超声图像分割的高效且可扩展解决方案的潜力，特别适用于标记数据稀缺的医学成像用例。

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的动态负提示方法，在去噪过程中自适应生成负提示，相比传统固定负提示方法有更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负提示方法使用固定的负提示，无法根据生成过程中的图像内容进行动态调整，限制了负提示的有效性。

Method: 在特定去噪步骤生成中间图像预测，然后查询视觉语言模型来生成上下文相关的负提示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上评估，展示了负引导强度与文本-图像对齐之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 动态负提示方法能够根据生成过程自适应调整，在保持文本-图像对齐的同时提供更有效的负引导。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PReMA攻击方法，通过仅修改输入图像而不改变提示词，就能操纵多模态扩散模型生成不当内容，揭示了现有模型在文本-图像对齐方面的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态扩散模型在文本和图像模态对齐方面存在不足，这种错位可能导致生成不适当内容的风险，特别是在NSFW内容生成方面。

Method: 提出Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA)方法，通过创建对抗性图像来操纵模型输出，而不需要修改提示词本身。

Result: 在图像修复和风格迁移任务上的综合评估证实了PReMA的有效性，能够成功操纵模型生成不当内容。

Conclusion: PReMA对多模态扩散模型的完整性构成了新的威胁，特别是在使用固定提示词的图像编辑应用中。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Motivation: 研究视频LLM在不同视角下对同一事件的时间理解是否一致，现有模型在跨视角一致性方面存在明显不足。

Method: 引入EgoExo-Con基准，包含同步的自我中心和他者中心视频对，提出View-GRPO强化学习框架来增强跨视角的时间推理一致性。

Result: 现有视频LLM在跨视角一致性表现较差，View-GRPO方法相比朴素SFT和GRPO在提升跨视角一致性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 跨视角时间一致性是视频LLM的重要挑战，View-GRPO框架能有效改善这一问题的同时保持单视角性能。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了OracleAgent，首个用于甲骨文信息结构化管理和检索的智能体系统，集成多模态知识库和LLM能力，显著提升甲骨文研究效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文研究面临两大挑战：复杂的多任务解释流程，以及信息组织和检索效率低下。学者需要花费大量时间搜索、整理和管理相关资源。

Method: 构建包含140万单字拓片图像和8万解释文本的多模态知识库，开发OracleAgent智能体系统，集成多种甲骨文分析工具，利用大语言模型灵活编排组件。

Result: 实验表明OracleAgent在多模态推理和生成任务上表现优异，超越主流MLLM（如GPT-4o）。案例研究证实能有效协助领域专家，显著降低研究时间成本。

Conclusion: OracleAgent是实现甲骨文辅助研究和自动化解释系统实用化部署的重要进展，为文化遗产研究提供了有效的技术支持。

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化3D高斯点和相机姿态的统一框架，无需预校准输入，通过交替优化策略同时提升场景重建质量和姿态精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法依赖外部相机姿态估计工具如COLMAP，这会引入计算瓶颈和误差传播问题。

Method: 将联合优化解耦为两个交替阶段：固定姿态下通过可微分渲染更新3D高斯参数，以及使用定制3D光流算法结合几何和光度约束优化相机姿态。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在重建质量上显著优于现有无COLMAP技术，并且总体上超越了基于COLMAP的基准方法。

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架能够有效处理大视角变化和稀疏特征分布等挑战性场景，逐步减少投影误差。

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Motivation: 当前端到端驾驶基准主要关注常规场景，无法充分测试系统在罕见但关键的长尾场景中的表现，且现有评估指标难以有效评估多模态驾驶性能。

Method: 构建包含4,021个驾驶片段（约12小时）的WOD-E2E数据集，专门收集发生频率低于0.03%的挑战性长尾场景，并提出基于评分者偏好标签的RFS评估指标。

Result: WOD-E2E数据集包含高级路由信息、自车状态和8个环绕相机的360度视角，验证集已发布评分者偏好标签，测试集用于2025年WOD-E2E挑战赛。

Conclusion: 该工作旨在推动可泛化、鲁棒且安全的端到端自动驾驶代理研究，使其能够处理复杂的现实世界场景。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然能通过梯度识别网络在图像识别任务中的关注区域，但将这些注意力信息直接集成到CNN表示中以进行语义对象理解的应用仍然有限。在SLAM等视觉任务中，CNN表示结合空间注意力对象位置可以提升性能。

Method: 利用任务特定的网络注意力，将基于网络梯度的层间注意力信息与CNN特征表示相结合，以改进帧关联性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线方法相比性能有所提升，特别是在大型环境中表现更好。

Conclusion: 将梯度注意力信息集成到CNN表示中能够有效提升RGB-D室内SLAM的性能，特别是在大规模环境中的帧关联任务。

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

Motivation: 现有的3D部件生成方法存在两个问题：隐式向量集表示缺乏几何细节，而显式体素表示共享全局网格导致小部件分辨率不足。需要结合两种范式的优势来生成高质量的详细部件。

Method: 1. 使用隐式向量集扩散过程生成边界框布局；2. 每个部件在独立的全分辨率体素网格中生成；3. 引入中心点编码策略解决不同尺寸部件间的信息交换对齐问题。

Conclusion: FullPart成功结合了隐式和显式表示的优势，解决了3D部件生成中的细节保留问题，并通过PartVerse-XL数据集为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

TL;DR: 提出了BasicAVSR作为任意尺度视频超分辨率的强基线，通过集成自适应多尺度频率先验、流引导传播单元、二阶运动补偿和超上采样单元四个关键组件，并在三种传播变体中实现不同应用需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任意尺度视频超分辨率在空间细节重现、时间一致性和计算复杂度方面面临挑战，需要开发一个既能处理不同缩放因子又能在不同应用场景下高效运行的解决方案。

Method: 1) 基于图像拉普拉斯金字塔的自适应多尺度频率先验；2) 流引导传播单元聚合相邻帧的时空信息；3) 二阶运动补偿单元实现更准确的空间对齐；4) 超上采样单元生成尺度感知且内容无关的上采样核。提供三种传播变体：单向RNN（在线推理）、带有限前瞻的单向RNN（容忍小延迟）、双向RNN（离线任务）。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了任意尺度视频超分辨率的技术水平，还将其核心组件扩展到多种框架以适应多样化场景，为相关领域提供了强有力的基准模型。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

TL;DR: 使用YOLOv8模型开发了一个实时自动检测孟加拉国机动三轮车（auto-rickshaws）的系统，在1730张标注图像上训练，达到83.447%的mAP50和超过78%的精确度与召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在南亚国家，机动三轮车是常见交通工具，但交通规则限制其进入某些路线。现有监控系统难以区分机动三轮车与其他车辆（特别是人力三轮车），人工视频分析又太耗时。

Method: 采用基于YOLOv8模型的实时目标检测方法，使用1730张在不同交通条件下拍摄的标注图像进行训练。

Conclusion: 提出的机器学习方法能有效自动检测机动三轮车，数据集已公开发布供进一步研究。

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

TL;DR: CRAG-MM是一个针对多模态多轮对话的综合RAG基准测试，包含6.5K个图像-问题-答案三元组和2K个基于视觉的多轮对话，涵盖13个领域，专门设计用于评估可穿戴设备场景下的多模态检索增强生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对可穿戴设备场景的全面多模态RAG基准测试，特别是支持多轮对话的评估标准，这限制了该领域的发展。

Method: 构建包含6.5K个图像-问题-答案三元组和2K个多轮对话的数据集，涵盖13个领域，设计了五种图像质量问题、六种问题类型，并包含不同实体流行度、信息动态性和对话轮次的变化。

Result: 评估显示简单RAG方法在单轮和多轮QA上的真实性分别仅为32%和43%，而业界最先进解决方案质量相似（32%/45%），表明仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: CRAG-MM基准测试填补了可穿戴设备多模态RAG评估的空白，已成功举办KDD Cup 2025竞赛，吸引了大量参与者，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个基于扩散模型的高分辨率运动轨迹估计框架MoTDiff，能从单张运动模糊图像中估计高质量的运动轨迹，在盲图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有从单张模糊图像提取运动信息的方法（如模糊核和光流）质量较低，表现为粗粒度且不准确，需要高分辨率、高质量的运动轨迹估计方法。

Method: 提出MoTDiff框架，包含两个关键组件：1）使用从单张模糊图像提取的多尺度特征图作为条件的条件扩散框架；2）新的训练方法，促进精确识别细粒度运动轨迹、一致估计运动路径整体形状和位置、以及沿运动轨迹的像素连通性。

Result: 实验表明，MoTDiff在盲图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的MoTDiff框架能够从单张运动模糊图像中估计出高质量的高分辨率运动轨迹，在多个应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

TL;DR: ConceptScope是一个可扩展的自动化框架，使用稀疏自编码器从视觉基础模型中提取人类可解释的概念，用于分析数据集偏差、识别偏见并进行鲁棒性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习数据集中普遍存在数据偏向某些概念的问题，但系统识别这些偏差需要昂贵的人工标注。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器在视觉基础模型表示上训练，发现和量化人类可解释概念，将概念分为目标、上下文和偏见类型，基于语义相关性和统计相关性进行分析。

Result: ConceptScope能够捕捉广泛的视觉概念，包括物体、纹理、背景、面部属性、情感和动作，产生与语义相关图像区域对齐的空间归因，可靠检测已知偏见并发现未标注的偏见。

Conclusion: ConceptScope为数据集审计和模型诊断提供了一个实用工具，能够自动识别数据集中的概念偏差。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

Motivation: 解决从抽象且不成比例的素描中估计3D人体姿态的独特挑战，克服以往方法因缺乏大规模素描-3D姿态标注数据而依赖耗时且泛化能力有限的优化方法的问题。

Method: 使用扩散模型从3D人体姿态投影的2D姿态合成素描图像，创建SKEP-120K合成数据集；结合现有2D姿态检测器和生成扩散先验进行素描特征提取，使用前馈神经网络进行2D姿态估计，并加入多个启发式损失函数保证几何一致性。

Conclusion: 通过"从合成中学习"策略和大规模合成数据集，成功构建了能够从多样化素描风格中高效准确估计3D人体姿态和形状的端到端框架。

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Motivation: 供应链可持续性对优化供应链绩效至关重要，风险管理是发展网络可持续性和提升供应链效率的基础问题，产品正确分类也是可持续供应链的关键要素。

Method: 使用新颖的几何深度网络提出集成深度网络Ch-EGN，这是一种混合卷积和几何深度学习的方法，利用供应链中的信息依赖关系来推导数据库中样本的不可见状态。

Result: 在DataCo数据集上风险管理的平均准确率达到98.95%；在SupplyGraph数据集上，5种产品组分类准确率100%，4种产品关系分类准确率98.07%，25种公司关系分类准确率92.37%。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法相比现有最先进方法具有平均改进和效率提升，结果证实了该方法在供应链风险管理和可持续性分析中的有效性。

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型，解决了文档布局生成领域数据稀缺和复杂布局生成困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档AI研究主要集中在文档布局分析，而文档布局生成研究不足，主要障碍是缺乏多样化的布局数据，现有研究过度依赖学术论文的曼哈顿式结构，缺乏报纸、杂志等开放世界文档类型。

Method: 1) 构建了首个百万级多样化文档布局数据集OmniLayout-1M，覆盖6种常见文档类型；2) 提出了0.5B参数的OmniLayout-LLM模型，采用两阶段粗到细学习范式：先学习通用布局原则，再迁移到特定领域。

Result: 在M$^{6}$Doc数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多个领域都取得了强劲性能，显著超越了现有的布局生成专家模型和几个最新的通用大语言模型。

Conclusion: OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型有效解决了文档布局生成中的数据稀缺和复杂布局生成挑战，为文档布局生成研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但对视频中时间信息的理解能力较弱且缺乏充分评估。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过判断时间箭头的简单但具有揭示性的挑战来评估模型的时间推理能力。

Method: 引入AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准，该基准使用与人类行为基线相同的刺激物，全面评估开放权重和专有、推理型和非推理型视觉语言模型在判断视频时间方向方面的表现。

Result: 大多数模型表现接近随机猜测，即使在物理不可逆过程（如自由落体、扩散/爆炸）和因果手动动作（除法/加法）等人类几乎能立即识别的任务上，最佳模型也远远落后于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统存在根本性差距：虽然它们能够捕捉丰富的视觉语义相关性，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解所需的归纳偏差。作者发布代码和数据以促进视觉语言模型物理和时间推理能力的进一步发展。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Conclusion: 基于人类认知启发的生成式图像融合方法能有效增强结构一致性和细节质量。

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Method: 在VGGFace2的大规模眼部图像上训练三种CNN架构（SqueezeNet、MobileNetv2、ResNet50），使用余弦和chi2度量分析性能，比较不同网络初始化，通过逻辑回归进行分数级融合，并使用LIME热图和Jensen-Shannon散度比较注意力模式。

Result: ResNet50单独表现最佳，但三种网络融合提供了显著增益。热图显示不同网络关注图像的不同区域，解释了它们的互补性。该方法在UBIPr数据库上显著优于先前工作。

Conclusion: 不同CNN模型在虹膜验证中具有互补性，网络融合策略能够显著提升性能，在UBIPr数据库上实现了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法存在模式坍塌问题，无法生成多样化轨迹假设；而生成方法难以在生成过程中直接融入安全约束，需要额外优化阶段。

Method: 使用约束流匹配方法，在流匹配过程中显式施加安全约束和运动学规则，并将驾驶激进程度参数化为控制信号。

Result: 在NavSim v2挑战赛中获得第二名，EPDMS得分为51.31，并获得创新奖。

Conclusion: CATG框架有效解决了自动驾驶规划中的模式坍塌和约束集成问题，能够生成多样化且符合安全要求的轨迹。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

Result: 在非受控条件的VGGFace2数据集上，眼部裁剪图像的等错误率为9-15%，明显高于全脸图像的3-6%；而在UFPR-Periocular数据集上，由于图像质量更高和采集协议更一致，取得了1-2%的等错误率。

Conclusion: 使用大规模数据集训练CNN可以显著提升眼周生物识别的性能，在高质量、一致性采集的数据集上能够达到非常低的错误率（1-2%），这是UFPR数据集上迄今为止报告的最佳性能。

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AEOS-Bench基准套件和AEOS-Former调度模型，用于解决敏捷地球观测卫星星座在大规模场景下的调度挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理大规模场景、动态环境和严格约束时往往简化复杂性，限制了实际性能。需要更现实的调度解决方案。

Method: 开发了包含3,907个卫星资产和16,410个场景的AEOS-Bench基准套件，并提出了基于Transformer的AEOS-Former调度模型，采用约束感知注意力机制和内部约束模块。

Result: AEOS-Former在任务完成率和能源效率方面优于基线模型，消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Conclusion: 该框架为AEOS星座调度提供了首个大规模基准和有效的Transformer解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR是一个视觉语言引导的扩散框架，专门针对场景文本超分辨率，通过融合OCR数据和交替调度策略，同时优化文本可读性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超分辨率方法主要关注失真或感知指标，对字符级错误不敏感，而场景文本（如标志、产品标签）往往包含最关键的信息，需要专门优化文本可读性。

Method: 使用文本-超分辨率融合控制网络（TS-ControlNet）和乒乓调度器，在合成语料库上训练文本恢复组件，同时保持主超分辨率分支冻结。

Result: 在SVT、SCUT-CTW1500和CUTE80数据集上，4倍和8倍超分辨率下，GLYPH-SR比扩散/GAN基线在OCR F1上提升高达15.18个百分点，同时保持竞争力的感知质量指标。

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR能够同时实现高可读性和高视觉真实感，提供既好看又好读的超分辨率结果。

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合EEG嵌入和空间显著性图的双条件框架，通过自适应思维映射器提取EEG特征，使用LoRA微调Stable Diffusion 2.1，并利用ControlNet分支进行空间控制，显著提升了图像重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG驱动的图像重建方法往往忽视空间注意力机制，限制了重建图像的保真度和语义一致性。

Method: 使用自适应思维映射器(ATM)提取EEG特征，通过LoRA微调Stable Diffusion 2.1来对齐神经信号与视觉语义，同时利用ControlNet分支基于显著性图进行空间控制。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG数据集上评估，该方法在低层和高层图像特征质量上显著优于现有方法，同时与人类视觉注意力高度一致。

Conclusion: 注意力先验能够解决EEG的模糊性，实现高保真度的图像重建，在医学诊断和神经自适应接口中有应用前景，通过预训练扩散模型的高效适应推进了神经解码技术。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了LoCoT2V-Bench基准，专门用于评估复杂输入条件下的长视频生成，包含多维度评估框架和新指标，发现现有方法在事件间一致性和高层次主题一致性方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成评估主要关注简化的提示和低层次指标，忽视了与提示的细粒度对齐以及叙事连贯性、主题表达等抽象维度，需要专门针对长视频复杂提示的评估基准。

Method: 基于真实世界视频构建包含场景转换和事件动态的现实复杂提示集，建立多维度评估框架，包括新提出的指标：事件级对齐、细粒度时间一致性、内容清晰度以及关注叙事流程、情感响应和角色发展的人类期望实现度(HERD)。

Result: 对9个代表性长视频生成模型进行全面评估，发现当前方法在基本视觉和时间方面表现良好，但在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高层次主题一致性等方面存在困难。

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为评估长形式复杂文本到视频生成提供了全面可靠的平台，并指明了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出A-TPT框架，通过引入角度多样性来改善视觉语言模型在测试时提示调优中的校准性能，通过最大化归一化文本特征之间的最小成对角度距离来实现特征均匀分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时提示调优方法缺乏文本特征间的分散性，导致校准性能不佳，这影响了视觉语言模型的可靠性、可信度和安全性。现有方法主要关注最大化平均文本特征分散度或施加正交约束，但忽略了角度多样性的关键作用。

Method: A-TPT框架引入角度多样性，通过在单位超球面上最大化归一化文本特征之间的最小成对角度距离，鼓励对应可学习提示诱导的文本特征分布的均匀性。

Result: A-TPT在各种骨干网络和数据集上的广泛实验中，在降低聚合平均校准误差方面持续优于最先进的TPT方法，同时保持相当的准确性。在自然分布偏移上表现出优越的零样本校准性能，并能很好地泛化到医学数据集。

Conclusion: 促进角度多样性是实现良好分散文本特征的有效方法，能显著改善视觉语言模型在测试时适应过程中的校准性能。

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 将基础3D重建模型（DUSt3R和MASt3R）适配用于点跟踪任务，通过3D基础对应关系实现竞争性的点跟踪性能，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用先进的3D重建模型在静态场景中的2D和3D对应能力，将其扩展应用于动态点跟踪任务，以提升点跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 结合重建损失与动态对应训练，添加可见性头，使用少量合成数据对MASt3R进行微调，仅在两帧对上进行训练和评估，去除时间上下文。

Result: 在四个数据集上取得竞争性或更优的点跟踪结果，例如在TAP-Vid-DAVIS上达到73.8 δ_avg/85.8%遮挡准确率，在EgoPoints和RGB-S上显著优于CoTracker3。

Conclusion: 通过3D基础对应关系的方法，能够有效实现点跟踪任务，特别是在动态和静态点对应混合的情况下表现优异，展示了3D重建模型在点跟踪任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练视觉语言模型，但由于缺乏详细文本描述，只能使用图像级描述来匹配视觉补丁，导致图像描述与补丁级视觉异常之间的语义错位，定位性能不佳。

Method: 提出多级细粒度语义描述(MFSC)自动构建多级细粒度文本描述，并设计FineGrainedAD框架，包含多级可学习提示(MLLP)和多级语义对齐(MLSA)两个组件。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上的实验表明，该方法在少样本设置下实现了优越的整体性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入多级细粒度语义描述和相应的对齐机制，显著提升了少样本异常检测的定位性能。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中物体-上下文关联偏见问题，这种偏见会降低模型在测试场景与训练共现模式不同时的零样本可靠性。

Method: 将问题重新定义为因果推理问题，在CLIP表示空间中估计物体和背景期望，通过采样外部数据集、批次邻居或文本描述来合成反事实嵌入，计算总直接效应并模拟干预来减去仅背景激活。

Result: 在上下文敏感基准测试中显著提升了最差组和平均准确率，建立了新的零样本最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个轻量级的表示级反事实框架，为去偏和可靠的多模态推理提供了实用的因果途径。

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自改进过程中模型在简单查询上生成高质量轨迹，但在复杂查询上表现不佳，导致优化不平衡，阻碍模型处理复杂推理任务的能力。

Method: 从分布重塑和轨迹重采样两个角度提出了四种策略，在探索和学习自改进过程中实现头尾数据重新平衡。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct和InternVL2.5-4B模型上的实验表明，该方法在视觉推理任务上平均比原始自改进方法提升3.86分。

Conclusion: 提出的头尾重新平衡策略能有效缓解自改进过程中的马太效应，持续提升视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱分割在智能脊柱侧弯诊断中至关重要，但面临两个主要挑战：1) 全局上下文知识学习不足，忽略了不同骨骼特征的高空间相关性；2) 脊柱骨骼包含丰富的形状和位置结构知识，需要编码到分割过程中。

Method: 1) 尺度自适应互补策略学习跨维度长距离相关性特征；2) 结构亲和力变换将语义特征与类特定亲和力结合，配合Transformer解码器进行结构感知推理；3) 特征混合损失聚合方法增强模型训练。

Result: 实验结果表明SA²Net相比其他最先进方法获得了优越的分割性能，且对不同骨干网络具有良好的适应性。

Conclusion: SA²Net作为一种有前景的工具，在智能脊柱图像分析中具有推进脊柱侧弯诊断的潜力。

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at
https://github.com/taetiseo09/SA2Net.

*Wen Xie,Yanjun Zhu,Gijs Overgoor,Yakov Bart,Agata Lapedriza Garcia,Sarah Ostadabbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视频摘要技术的自动视频广告剪辑框架，将视频剪辑定义为针对广告的镜头选择问题，强调音频在广告中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统广告剪辑需要手动从长视频广告中选择和重新编辑镜头来创建短版本，这既费时又费力。

Method: 开发了一个双流音视频融合模型，预测视频帧的重要性，重要性定义为帧在公司制作的短广告中被选中的可能性。

Result: 在AdSum204数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型在平均精度、曲线下面积、Spearman和Kendall等各项指标上均优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了自动视频广告剪辑，通过音视频融合方法显著提升了剪辑质量。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

*Manjunath Prasad Holenarasipura Rajiv,B. M. Vidyavathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出动态上下文感知场景推理框架，利用视觉-语言对齐解决零样本真实场景理解问题，在未见环境中实现18%的准确率提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中AI系统常面临无标注数据的陌生场景，传统场景理解模型难以泛化到未见情境，限制了视觉应用在动态非结构化环境中的部署

Method: 集成预训练视觉变换器和大型语言模型，将视觉语义与自然语言描述对齐，通过动态推理模块结合全局场景线索和对象级交互，利用语言先验指导预测

Result: 在COCO、Visual Genome和Open Images等零样本基准测试中，复杂未见环境的场景理解准确率比基线模型提升高达18%，在模糊或杂乱场景中表现稳健

Conclusion: 该框架为上下文感知推理提供了可扩展和可解释的方法，推进了动态真实环境中零样本泛化能力的发展

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

### [56] [CATCH: A Modular Cross-domain Adaptive Template with Hook](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26582)
*Xinjin Li,Yulie Lu,Jinghan Cao,Yu Ma,Zhenglin Li,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATCH是一个即插即用的跨域适应框架，通过解耦视觉和语言适应，使用轻量级域分类器和双适配器机制，在不重新训练主干模型的情况下提升VQA模型在遥感、医疗、数学等领域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在自然图像领域表现优异，但在跨域场景（如遥感、医疗、数学图表）中泛化能力显著下降，现有方法依赖昂贵的逐域微调或定制化流程，缺乏灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出CATCH框架，包含域分类器和双适配器机制（提示适配器和视觉适配器），通过统一钩子接口动态注入，无需重新训练主干模型。

Result: 在四个领域特定VQA基准测试中取得一致性能提升：MathVQA上BLEU+2.3，MedVQA-RAD上VQA+2.6，ChartQA上ROUGE+3.1。

Conclusion: CATCH为多域VQA提供了可扩展和可扩展的方法，能够在不同应用领域实现实际部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

TL;DR: Emu3.5是一个大规模多模态世界模型，通过统一的下一标记预测目标在超过10万亿标记的视觉-语言交织数据上进行端到端预训练，能够自然地处理交织的视觉-语言输入并生成交织的视觉-语言输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够原生预测视觉和语言下一状态的多模态世界模型，实现长程视觉-语言生成、任意到图像生成和复杂文本丰富图像生成等能力。

Method: 采用端到端预训练，使用统一的下一标记预测目标在视觉-语言交织数据上训练；通过大规模强化学习进行后训练以增强多模态推理和生成；提出离散扩散适应（DiDA）方法加速推理。

Result: Emu3.5在图像生成和编辑任务上达到与Gemini 2.5 Flash Image相当的性能，在一系列交织生成任务上表现更优；推理速度提升约20倍；展现出时空一致的世界探索和开放世界具身操作能力。

Conclusion: Emu3.5展示了强大的原生多模态能力，包括长程视觉-语言生成、任意到图像生成和复杂文本丰富图像生成，并展现出可泛化的世界建模能力，支持社区研究。

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResMatching是一种新的计算超分辨率方法，使用引导条件流匹配学习数据先验，在BioSR数据集上表现优异，特别是在噪声图像中效果显著，并能提供像素级不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荧光显微镜中的计算超分辨率是一个不适定问题，核心在于找到能够外推显微镜未成像频率的先验。随着数据驱动机器学习技术的发展，可以学习更强的先验来获得更好的超分辨率结果。

Method: 提出ResMatching方法，使用引导条件流匹配来学习改进的数据先验，能够从隐式学习的后验分布中采样，并提供像素级数据不确定性估计。

Result: 在BioSR数据集的4个不同生物结构上评估，与7个基线方法比较，ResMatching在所有情况下都实现了数据保真度和感知真实性的最佳平衡，特别在噪声图像中表现优异。

Conclusion: ResMatching在计算超分辨率中表现优异，特别是在学习强先验困难的情况下，能够提供校准的后验分布和不确定性估计，指导用户拒绝不确定的预测。

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统作物产量预测方法缺乏可扩展性和精细度，无法满足精准农业的需求，需要开发更精确、可操作的预测工具。

Method: 利用预训练的大规模地理空间基础模型Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M，通过微调适应连续回归任务，将多时相卫星影像转换为密集的像素级产量图。

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

*Christoffer Koo Øhrstrøm,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种专门为事件相机设计的事件标记化方法Spiking Patches，能够保持事件的异步性和空间稀疏性，在保持精度的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将事件表示为帧或体素，虽然精度高但失去了事件相机的异步性和空间稀疏性特性，需要一种能保持这些独特属性的表示方法。

Method: 使用Spiking Patches标记化器将异步稀疏事件流转换为标记，并在手势识别和物体检测任务上使用GNN、PCN和Transformer进行评估。

Result: 标记化表示比体素标记快3.4倍，比帧快10.4倍，同时保持相同精度，在某些情况下精度还有提升（手势识别提升3.8%，物体检测提升1.4%）。

Conclusion: 事件标记化为事件视觉提供了新方向，是朝着保持事件相机特性方法的重要一步。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Abstract: To address the challenges in UAV object detection, such as complex
backgrounds, severe occlusion, dense small objects, and varying lighting
conditions,this paper proposes PT-DETR based on RT-DETR, a novel detection
algorithm specifically designed for small objects in UAV imagery. In the
backbone network, we introduce the Partially-Aware Detail Focus (PADF) Module

model's ability to capture small-object details and contextual information.
Furthermore,we incorporate Focaler-SIoU to strengthen the model's bounding box
matching capability and increase its sensitivity to small-object features,
thereby further enhancing detection accuracy and robustness. Compared with

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

TL;DR: 该论文首次大规模评估了48种深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰影像上的性能，多个模型实现了亚公里级精度，证明深度学习光流方法可有效应用于极地遥感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海冰漂移的准确估计对北极航行、气候研究和业务预报至关重要，但传统光流方法在复杂场景中精度有限，需要探索深度学习方法的适用性。

Method: 使用48种深度学习光流模型处理RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰影像，通过端点误差(EPE)和Fl指标与GNSS跟踪浮标进行对比评估。

Result: 多个模型达到亚公里级精度(EPE 6-8像素，300-400米)，能够捕捉一致的区域漂移模式，相比传统方法显著提高了运动估计精度。

Conclusion: 深度学习光流方法可成功迁移到极地遥感领域，提供空间连续的海冰漂移场，为导航和气候建模提供新机遇。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两种基于场景信息融合的方法来增强RPN-DCNN目标检测网络对遮挡的鲁棒性：一种在预测前根据背景场景选择定制网络，另一种在检测后将场景知识融合到初始目标分数中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遮挡对目标识别算法构成重大挑战，场景上下文信息有助于生物视觉中的目标识别，因此希望通过融合场景信息来减少遮挡导致的错误。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可解释性，易于适应其他数据集，为未来研究和实际应用提供了多种方向。

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future

Abstract: We present a long-term deployment study of a machine vision-based anomaly
detection system for failure prediction in a steel rolling mill. The system
integrates industrial cameras to monitor equipment operation, alignment, and
hot bar motion in real time along the process line. Live video streams are
processed on a centralized video server using deep learning models, enabling
early prediction of equipment failures and process interruptions, thereby
reducing unplanned breakdown costs. Server-based inference minimizes the
computational load on industrial process control systems (PLCs), supporting
scalable deployment across production lines with minimal additional resources.
By jointly analyzing sensor data from data acquisition systems and visual
inputs, the system identifies the location and probable root causes of
failures, providing actionable insights for proactive maintenance. This
integrated approach enhances operational reliability, productivity, and
profitability in industrial manufacturing environments.

the landscape of 3D scene representations, inspiring an extensive body of
associated research. Follow-up work includes analyses and contributions that
enhance the efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability of 3DGS. In

examine efforts to bring 3DGS to mobile and virtual reality platforms, its
extension to massive-scale environments, and recent progress toward
near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed
computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved
from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for
3D vision and graphics.

*Ziyu Guo,Xinyan Chen,Renrui Zhang,Ruichuan An,Yu Qi,Dongzhi Jiang,Xiangtai Li,Manyuan Zhang,Hongsheng Li,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估Veo-3视频模型在12个维度上的零样本推理能力，发现其在短时空间连贯性和局部动态一致性方面表现良好，但在长时因果推理和抽象逻辑方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视频生成模型是否能够作为零样本推理器在复杂视觉推理场景中使用，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 通过构建MME-CoF基准数据集，系统评估Veo-3模型在空间、几何、物理、时间和具身逻辑等12个维度的推理行为。

Result: 视频模型在短时空间连贯性、细粒度定位和局部动态一致性方面显示出有希望的推理模式，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面存在限制。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型还不能作为独立的零样本推理器，但可以作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎，展现出令人鼓舞的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteerVLM是一个轻量级转向模块，通过动态调整语言模态与图像上下文之间的激活来引导视觉语言模型更好地遵循指令，无需修改模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在遵循复杂指令方面存在不足，需要一种轻量级方法来精确控制模型输出语义，同时保持原有任务性能。

Method: 从编码目标行为和相反行为的配对提示的潜在嵌入中学习，通过维度激活调制和跨层自适应转向来动态调整激活，仅需学习原始模型0.14%的参数。

Result: 在转向和幻觉缓解基准测试中优于现有干预技术，提出了通过激活工程实现多模态模型控制的稳健解决方案。

Conclusion: SteerVLM提供了一种无需修改模型权重的细粒度推理时控制方法，同时引入了VNIA数据集来支持VLM转向技术的开发和评估。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of
irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research
focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM
challenge - the most comprehensive AMD detection from RGB fundus images
research competition and open dataset to date - serve as a benchmark for our
evaluation. Taking the U-Net connectivity as a base of our framework, we
evaluate and compare several approaches to improve the segmentation model's
architecture and training pipeline, including pre-processing techniques,
encoder (backbone) deep network types of varying complexity, and specialized
loss functions to mitigate class imbalances on image and pixel levels. The main
outcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection
framework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the
multi-class segmentation of different AMD lesion types in non-invasive RGB
fundus images. The source code used to conduct the experiments presented in
this paper is made freely available.

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了当前模型在图表理解任务中的细粒度差异，并指出了需要加强的具体技能。

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的分层运动建模方法，通过图神经网络学习数据驱动的运动层次结构，将全局绝对运动分解为父级继承模式和局部运动残差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动定义或启发式的固定运动基元层次结构，限制了在不同任务间的泛化能力。需要一种能够直接从数据中学习结构化、可解释运动关系的通用方法。

Method: 将层次推断构建为可微图学习问题，顶点表示基本运动，有向边通过图神经网络捕获学习的父子依赖关系，使用图基层次表示观测运动。

Result: 在1D平移运动、2D旋转运动和3D高斯溅射场景变形三个示例中，成功重建了内在运动层次结构，相比基线产生了更真实和可解释的变形效果。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个适应性强、数据驱动的分层建模范式，适用于广泛的运动中心任务。

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Conclusion: 通过系统地从视频生成向运动生成迁移知识，该工作有效解决了3D人体运动生成的泛化瓶颈问题，为相关领域提供了数据集、模型和评估基准。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 解决全球尺度图像精确定位的挑战，传统图像检索方法在大规模数据下效率低且覆盖不足，现有可扩展方案在精度和适用范围上存在局限。

Method: 使用代理分类任务训练学习隐含精确位置信息的特征表示，结合地面和航空影像的嵌入表示，提高对稀疏地面数据的鲁棒性。

Result: 在覆盖欧洲大部分地区的数据集上，68%的查询能定位在200米范围内，实现了跨多国区域的直接细粒度检索。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了大规模地理定位的精度与可扩展性之间的权衡问题，为跨大陆尺度的细粒度地理定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: SEE4D是一个无需姿态标注的视频到4D内容生成框架，通过虚拟相机渲染和视图条件修复模型，从任意视频合成时空4D内容，避免了传统方法对相机姿态标注的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到4D方法需要手动标注相机姿态，这在野外视频中成本高昂且脆弱。虽然最近的方法通过扭曲-修复策略减少了姿态标注需求，但轨迹到轨迹的表述容易混淆相机运动和场景动态。

Method: 提出轨迹到相机框架，用固定虚拟相机渲染替换显式轨迹预测，将相机控制与场景建模分离。训练视图条件视频修复模型学习几何先验，通过去噪合成扭曲图像修复遮挡区域，无需显式3D标注。

Result: 在跨视图视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中，SEE4D在定量指标和定性评估上都优于基于姿态或轨迹条件的基线方法，展现出更好的泛化能力和性能。

Conclusion: SEE4D通过分离相机控制和场景建模，实现了从任意视频进行实用4D世界建模的进步，无需昂贵的3D监督。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归字幕方法中视觉学习信号强度依赖于序列位置的问题，减少对辅助目标的需求。

Method: 训练时随机掩码图像-字幕对中的文本标记，使用基于视觉特征的解码器重建原始文本。

Result: 线性探测实验显示，MDC学习的视觉特征在多种学术规模模型和数据集上与自回归和对比方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MDC提供了一种有效的视觉特征学习方法，无需依赖序列位置，简化了训练过程。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

Result: 构建了大规模合成全景数据集，并在全景视觉感知和图形就绪3D场景生成方面展示了有效性。

Conclusion: 为沉浸式和物理真实的虚拟世界生成开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 一个3.8B参数的模型在FACTS基准测试中达到与GPT-4o相当的性能（在±5个百分点等效范围内），云服务成本降低约19倍，自托管/边缘部署可接近零边际成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发成本效益高的小型语言模型，在保持性能的同时大幅降低部署成本，特别是针对事实基础任务。

Method: 结合最小化的"外骨骼推理"支架和行为微调，教导协议遵守而非领域知识，两者协同作用显著提升性能并减少方差。

Result: 在Q1-Q500测试中，Humans-Junior得分72.7%，GPT-4o得分73.5%，差异仅0.8个百分点，在±5pp范围内等效。前沿模型仅通过提示工程即可获得额外提升。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的推理支架和行为微调，小型模型可以在特定任务上达到前沿模型性能，同时大幅降低成本，为高效AI部署提供可行路径。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

Result: 开发了一种能够将国际象棋引擎评估归因于特定棋子的方法，该方法受到传统象棋教学方法的启发，并基于现代可解释AI技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为可视化、人类训练和引擎比较开辟了新可能性，并发布了相关代码和数据以促进可解释象棋AI的未来研究。

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业5.0需要更高效、低延迟的AI模型部署方案，特别是在边缘设备上实现本地推理和实时处理，以减少对外部数据传输的依赖。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for Industry 5.0 that simplifies the deployment
of AI models on edge devices in various industrial settings. The design reduces
latency and avoids external data transfer by enabling local inference and
real-time processing. Our implementation is agent-based, which means that
individual agents, whether human, algorithmic, or collaborative, are
responsible for well-defined tasks, enabling flexibility and simplifying
integration. Moreover, our framework supports modular integration and maintains

*Vanessa Figueiredo,David Elumeze*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究了在基于GPT-4o的侦探游戏中，高约束提示和低约束提示对玩家体验的影响，发现约束程度对体验无显著差异，并提出了符号化支架游戏框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在交互式游戏中，约束性提示是否真正能改善玩家体验，特别是在基于大语言模型的非玩家角色对话系统中。

Method: 通过《The Interview》语音侦探游戏进行用户研究（N=10），比较高约束提示和低约束提示；随后重新设计为混合JSON+RAG支架，并进行合成评估。

Result: 发现支架效果具有角色依赖性：面试官角色获得稳定性，而嫌疑人角色失去即兴可信度；约束程度对玩家体验无可靠差异。

Conclusion: 推翻了"更严格的约束必然增强游戏体验"的假设，提出了符号化支架游戏框架，使用模糊数值边界来平衡稳定性和即兴性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出人机协作框架，从仅标签标注中推断思维轨迹，通过拒绝采样方法重构这些轨迹，用于微调开源LLM评分器和优化专有LLM评分器的标注指南，显著提升LLM与人类判断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs越来越多地用于评估任务，但在主观任务中的可靠性有限，因为人类判断涉及超越标注标签的微妙推理。思维轨迹（判断背后的推理）信息丰富但难以收集和整理。

Method: 提出人机协作框架，使用简单有效的拒绝采样方法从仅标签标注中推断思维轨迹，并将这些推断的思维轨迹应用于两个互补任务：微调开源LLM评分器和合成更清晰的专有LLM评分器标注指南。

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法显著提高了LLM与人类判断的一致性。此外，优化的标注指南增加了不同LLM模型之间的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为人类思维轨迹的实际代理，使仅标签语料库能够扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，从而提高LLM评分器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两层次框架来解释为什么压缩过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式，认为智能是在结构化环境中持续存在的机械必然结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架都强调压缩对智能的核心作用，但未能具体说明为什么这个过程会强制发现因果结构而不是表面统计模式。

Method: 引入信息论必要性(ITI)和压缩效率原则(CEP)的两层次框架：ITI建立系统在不确定环境中必须通过预测压缩最小化认知熵；CEP说明高效压缩如何通过异常积累动态机制性地选择生成性因果模型。

Result: 该框架产生了可实证检验的预测：压缩效率与分布外泛化相关；异常积累率区分因果模型和相关模型；分层系统在抽象层间显示效率增长；生物系统展示与表征复杂性相关的代谢成本。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP为生物、人工和多尺度系统的收敛提供了统一解释，解决了智能的认知和功能维度，无需诉诸意识或主观经验的假设。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于角色的偏好建模框架，通过聚合多个评分标准条件下的法官输出来解决LLM法官与人类偏好对齐的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM法官难以校准，存在评分标准敏感性、偏见和不稳定性问题，这影响了RLHF奖励模型和模型路由系统的可靠性。

Method: 开发了基于角色的偏好标签大规模合成方法，并实现了两种聚合器：广义可加模型(GAM)和多层感知器(MLP)。

Result: 评估了该方法相对于简单基线的性能，并通过案例研究检验了其对人类和LLM法官偏见的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效建模多样化的基于角色的偏好，为LLM法官与人类偏好对齐提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

TL;DR: SciTrust 2.0是一个评估科学应用中LLM可信度的框架，涵盖真实性、对抗鲁棒性、科学安全和科学伦理四个维度。评估显示通用行业模型在各方面优于科学专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在科学研究中具有变革潜力，但在高风险环境中的部署引发了可信度担忧，需要系统评估框架。

Method: 开发了包含新颖开放式真实性基准和伦理基准的评估框架，通过验证的反思调优流程和专家验证构建，使用多种评估指标对7个主要LLM进行评估。

Result: 通用行业模型在所有可信度维度上都优于科学专用模型，GPT-4-mini在真实性和对抗鲁棒性方面表现最佳。科学专用模型在逻辑和伦理推理能力上存在显著缺陷，在生物安全和化学武器等高风险领域存在安全隐患。

Conclusion: 通过开源该框架，为开发更可信的AI系统提供了基础，并推进了科学背景下模型安全与伦理的研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

Motivation: FinOps从业者面临来自多个云提供商和内部系统的异构计费数据格式、分类和指标，导致难以综合可操作的见解并做出及时决策。

Method: 构建FinOps代理系统，模拟从多源数据检索到数据整合分析再到生成优化建议的端到端行业流程，使用开源和闭源语言模型进行评估。

Result: 代理能够理解、规划和执行任务，表现与实际的FinOps从业者相当，证明了AI代理在FinOps自动化中的可行性。

Conclusion: 自主、目标驱动的AI代理可以有效解决FinOps中的数据异构性挑战，实现自动化成本优化和业务价值最大化。

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类的目标导向行为受到认知偏差影响，与人类交互的自主系统需要意识到这一点，特别是在日常任务如驾驶中，人们的注意力偏差会系统性地影响行为表现。

Method: 结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模的方法，通过注意力感知逆规划来推断认知偏差，并在Waymo开放数据集的真实驾驶场景中进行验证。

Result: 展示了注意力感知逆规划与标准逆强化学习的系统性差异，成功推断出强化学习智能体在真实驾驶场景中的注意力策略。

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆规划方法具有可扩展性，能够有效估计认知偏差，为理解人类行为中的认知因素提供了新途径。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于代理的自然语言转SQL系统，通过Mistral-based ReAct代理扩展基础SQL生成器，显著提升了时空查询的准确性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NL-to-SQL系统在处理现实的时空查询时表现不佳，需要解决用户模糊表达与数据库模式对齐、时间推理和输出选择等问题。

Method: 采用代理化管道，通过模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具，使代理能够规划、分解和适应查询。

Result: 在35个自然语言查询测试中，代理系统准确率达到91.4%，远高于基础系统的28.6%，并通过地图、图表和自然语言摘要增强了可用性。

Conclusion: 代理化编排比单纯强化SQL生成器更有前景，是构建交互式地理空间助手的有希望基础。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure

in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通场景中容易陷入困境，而现有的远程干预和人工接管方案存在成本高、效率低、限制非驾驶员使用等问题。

Method: 开发了StuckSolver作为插件模块，利用LLM分析传感器数据检测被困状态，理解环境上下文，并生成可由车辆原生规划器执行的高级恢复指令。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试和自定义不确定场景中，StuckSolver仅通过自主推理就达到接近最优性能，结合乘客引导后表现更佳。

Conclusion: StuckSolver提供了一种有效且可扩展的解决方案，能够提升自动驾驶车辆在复杂场景中的恢复能力，同时保持系统架构的兼容性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化中的知识差距，提出了GUI知识的三维框架，并创建了GUI知识基准来评估模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化方面仍落后于人类，作者假设这是由于缺乏核心GUI知识，而现有的训练方法无法完全解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析GUI任务执行中的常见失败模式，将GUI知识提炼为三个维度：界面感知、交互预测和指令理解，并创建了跨6个平台、292个应用的GUI知识基准。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs能够识别控件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测动作和验证任务完成方面存在困难。真实GUI任务实验验证了GUI知识与任务成功之间的紧密联系。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估GUI知识提供了结构化框架，支持在下游训练前选择更有潜力的VLMs，并为构建更强大的GUI智能体提供了见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个量化的大语言模型推理经济学框架，将LLM推理视为计算驱动的智能生产活动，分析了边际成本、规模经济和输出质量，并基于WiNEval-3.0数据构建了首个LLM推理生产前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的推理成本已成为决定其商业可行性和广泛应用的关键因素，需要建立经济分析框架来指导模型部署决策。

Method: 采用量化推理经济学框架，将LLM推理过程视为计算驱动的智能生产活动，基于WiNEval-3.0的实证数据构建LLM推理生产前沿。

Result: 揭示了三个原则：边际成本递减、规模收益递减和最优成本效益区域，为模型部署提供了经济依据。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为模型部署决策提供了经济基础，还为未来基于市场的AI推理资源定价和优化奠定了实证基础。

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Curriculum两阶段课程学习法，先在数学领域通过RL培养推理能力，然后在多领域联合RL中迁移和巩固这些能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习主要关注数学和代码领域，需要开发能跨领域迁移推理能力的通用方法。

Method: 两阶段课程：第一阶段数学领域RL开发推理技能；第二阶段多领域联合RL迁移和巩固技能。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B上的多领域评估显示一致性能提升，认知技能分析表明数学优先策略能增强解决复杂问题的重要认知行为。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一个紧凑、易于采用的通用推理能力培养方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI
research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert
guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization,

LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal
impact.

TL;DR: ToolRM是一个专门为工具学习设计的轻量级生成式奖励模型家族，通过构建多样化的偏好数据集和新的评估基准，显著提升了语言模型在函数调用任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工具学习领域，缺乏专门为函数调用任务设计的奖励模型限制了智能代理AI的发展。现有的奖励模型无法有效评估工具使用场景中的表现。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的流水线，使用基于规则的评分和多维采样构建成对偏好数据，创建了ToolPref-Pairwise-30K数据集，并基于BFCL构建了TRBench评估基准。

Result: 基于Qwen3-4B/8B系列的模型在成对奖励判断中准确率提升高达14.28%，显著优于Claude 4和OpenAI o3等前沿模型，在推理时减少超过66%的输出token使用。

Conclusion: ToolRM不仅提升了工具学习中的奖励建模效果，还能泛化到更广泛的评判任务，为未来研究提供了数据和模型检查点。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前问卷数据难以被LLM有效处理，现有工具主要面向人工操作，缺乏将问卷数据与LLM和AI自动化集成的指导。

Method: 引入QASU基准，测试6种结构技能（包括答案查找、受访者计数和多跳推理），使用6种序列化格式和多种提示策略进行实验。

Result: 选择合适的格式和提示组合可将准确率提升高达8.8个百分点；通过自增强提示添加轻量级结构提示可进一步平均提升3-4个百分点。

Conclusion: QASU基准为基于LLM的问卷分析研究和实践提供了简单而多功能的基础，通过系统隔离格式和提示效应来推进该领域发展。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REG-TSC是一个基于检索增强生成（RAG）的分布式LLM代理系统，用于通用交通信号控制。它通过紧急感知推理框架和类型无关的交通表示，解决了LLM在紧急情况下的幻觉问题，并提升了在异构交叉口的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着城市交通复杂性增加，交通信号控制（TSC）对优化交通流和提高道路安全至关重要。但LLM在紧急情况下容易产生幻觉，导致不可靠决策；同时异构交叉口类型给交通状态编码和跨交叉口训练带来挑战，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 1. 紧急感知推理框架：根据紧急场景动态调整推理深度，配备基于Reviewer的紧急RAG（RERAG）从历史案例中提取知识和指导。2. 类型无关交通表示和奖励引导的强化细化（R3）：自适应采样不同交叉口的训练经验，使用基于环境反馈的优先级，通过设计的奖励加权似然损失微调LLM代理。

Result: 在三个真实道路网络上（17到177个异构交叉口）的实验显示，REG-TSC将旅行时间减少42.00%，队列长度减少62.31%，紧急车辆等待时间减少83.16%，优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: REG-TSC通过RAG增强的分布式LLM代理和紧急响应机制，有效提升了交通信号控制的可靠性和在异构交叉口的泛化性能，显著改善了交通效率和安全。

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于群体的强化学习方法在训练多轮交互LLM智能体时出现的结构盲目性问题，包括低效探索、不精确信用分配和短视规划三个关键挑战。

Method: 动态构建状态转移图，利用图论中心性提供三种协同学习信号：结构化内在奖励、图增强优势函数和动态折扣因子。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和专有Workbench基准测试中，GEPO相比竞争基线分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 明确建模环境结构是推进LLM智能体训练的稳健、可泛化策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance是一个框架，通过将法规文本表示为政策图、运行时上下文表示为上下文图，并将两者对齐，来帮助大规模网络合规性评估。该方法在GDPR相关场景中比纯LLM和RAG基线表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络规模的合规性面临实际挑战：每个请求都需要进行法规评估。法规文本（如GDPR）具有交叉引用和规范性，而运行时上下文是非结构化的自然语言。这促使我们研究如何将非结构化文本中的语义信息与结构化、规范性的法规元素对齐。

Method: 引入GraphCompliance框架，将法规文本表示为政策图（编码规范结构和交叉引用），将运行时上下文表示为上下文图（将事件形式化为主体-动作-对象三元组和实体关系三元组），然后将两者对齐。这种对齐将法官LLM的推理锚定在结构化信息中。

Result: 在300个GDPR衍生的真实场景实验中，GraphCompliance在五个评估任务中比纯LLM和RAG基线的micro-F1得分高出4.1-7.2个百分点，具有更少的欠预测和过预测，导致更高的召回率和更低的误报率。

Conclusion: 消融研究表明每个图组件都有贡献，表明结构化表示和法官LLM在规范性推理中是互补的。

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了IPA-UCT方法，通过弱化状态抽象条件来在噪声和大动作空间环境中找到更多抽象，从而提升MCTS的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的状态-动作对抽象方法（如OGA-UCT）在大动作空间或噪声环境中难以找到状态抽象，限制了MCTS的样本效率提升。

Method: 提出IPA-UCT方法，使用更弱的状态抽象条件（IPA框架），允许轻微精度损失来获得更多抽象。IPA和ASAP都是更通用p-ASAP框架的特例。

Result: 实验验证IPA-UCT在广泛测试域和迭代预算下优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法。

Conclusion: IPA-UCT通过弱化抽象条件有效解决了状态抽象稀缺问题，显著提升了MCTS性能。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

Motivation: 现有任务选择方法存在高成本、适应性差或证据不完整的问题，而均匀任务采样效率低下，浪费计算资源在简单或无法解决的任务上。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推断维护任务难度的后验估计，结合显性证据（直接评估）和隐性证据（通过插值估计未评估任务难度），使用Thompson采样平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在多个领域和LLM规模上，BOTS相比基线和消融实验，持续提高了数据效率和性能。

Conclusion: BOTS为RFT中的动态任务选择提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

Conclusion: 项目中心方法能够实现更高效的模型评估，同时提供更好的冷启动性能和更可解释的基准测试。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动评分系统只能提供通过/失败结果，无法深入了解学生思维和学习需求，无法为教师提供可扩展的有意义反馈。

Method: 使用微调的大语言模型自动生成反馈，并通过对比学习代码嵌入进行可视化，将学生代码按功能和方式聚类，支持提示池让教师选择反馈风格。

Result: 在600份学生提交的评估中，系统生成的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐，基于1000份标注提交训练的代码嵌入能有效聚类解决方案。

Conclusion: Autograder+通过AI驱动的反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，减轻教师工作量，支持针对性教学，促进更好的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs)应用于MedCLIP的潜在空间，通过相关性指标、熵分析和MedGEMMA自动神经元命名来量化可解释性，在CheXpert数据集上验证了比原始MedCLIP特征更高的单义性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI需要既准确又可解释的模型，推进医学视觉中的机制可解释性研究。

Method: 将Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs)应用于MedCLIP的潜在空间，提出结合相关性指标、熵分析和MedGEMMA自动神经元命名的评估框架。

Result: 在CheXpert数据集上，MedSAE神经元比原始MedCLIP特征实现了更高的单义性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究连接了高性能医疗AI与透明度，为临床可靠表示提供了可扩展的步骤。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

### [108] [Chain-of-Thought Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26418)
*Jianli Zhao,Tingchen Fu,Rylan Schaeffer,Mrinank Sharma,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chain-of-Thought Hijacking的越狱攻击方法，通过在有害请求前添加无害的推理步骤来绕过大型推理模型的安全防护，攻击成功率极高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型通过增加推理时间计算可以提高任务性能，但研究发现相同的推理过程也可能被用来绕过安全防护，这与之前认为推理能增强安全性的观点相反。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击方法，将有害请求与长序列的无害谜题推理步骤相结合，通过稀释安全检查信号来绕过模型的安全机制。

Result: 在HarmBench测试中，该方法在Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT o4 mini、Grok 3 mini和Claude 4 Sonnet上的攻击成功率分别达到99%、94%、100%和94%，远超之前的越狱方法。

Conclusion: 最可解释的推理形式——显式思维链，当与最终答案提示结合时，本身可能成为越狱向量，揭示了推理模型安全机制中的新漏洞。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

*Clarissa Sabrina Arlinghaus,Tristan Kenneweg,Barbara Hammer,Günter W. Maier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT-4o在招聘决策中表现出强烈的从众倾向，面对8个模拟伙伴时几乎完全从众(99.9%)，即使只有1个伙伴时也有40.2%的从众率，表明LLMs会适应感知到的社会共识而非独立判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解大型语言模型在社会影响下的从众行为，特别是在高风险决策场景中的表现，以评估将LLMs作为决策辅助工具的风险。

Method: 在招聘情境下进行三个预注册的从众实验：基线研究确定GPT的初始偏好；研究1让GPT面对8个模拟伙伴的一致反对；研究2让GPT与单个伙伴互动。

Result: GPT在基线研究中稳定偏好同一候选人，但在社会压力下显著从众，报告更低的确定性和更高的信息性和规范性从众动机。

Conclusion: GPT不会作为独立观察者行动，而是适应感知的社会共识，这凸显了将LLMs视为中立决策辅助工具的风险，需要在暴露于人类意见前获取AI判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

TL;DR: 提出了LINK-KG框架，通过LLM引导的三阶段指代消解管道和知识图谱提取，有效解决法律文档中实体指代模糊和变化的问题，显著减少节点重复和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口走私网络复杂多变，法律案例文档提供了丰富信息但结构混乱、指代模糊，现有方法难以处理长文本的指代消解，导致知识图谱碎片化和实体链接不一致。

Method: LINK-KG采用模块化框架，集成三阶段LLM引导的指代消解管道和下游KG提取，核心是类型特定的提示缓存，跨文档块一致跟踪和解析指代。

Result: 相比基线方法，LINK-KG平均节点重复减少45.21%，噪声节点减少32.22%，生成更清洁连贯的图结构。

Conclusion: LINK-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了坚实基础，显著改善了法律文本知识图谱构建的质量。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

TL;DR: 本文系统化地定义了上下文工程，追溯其从1990年代至今的发展历程，分析了从人机交互到人-智能体交互的演进，并为AI系统中的上下文工程提供了概念基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能的发展，机器需要更好地理解人类的情境和目的。马克思关于"人的本质是社会关系总和"的观点启发了研究者思考如何让机器在交互中理解上下文，从而提出了上下文工程的概念。

Method: 通过历史分析的方法，追溯上下文工程从早期人机交互框架到现代智能体交互的发展历程，系统化定义概念并分析关键设计考量。

Result: 建立了上下文工程的概念框架，识别了其发展的三个历史阶段：基于原始计算机的早期人机交互、当前智能体驱动的人-智能体交互，以及未来可能的人类级或超人类智能交互。

Conclusion: 上下文工程是AI系统发展的重要方向，本文为其提供了概念基础，并展望了系统化上下文工程在AI系统中的广阔前景。

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

TL;DR: 结合AI评分和基于AI评分者置信度的人类评分比单独依赖任一方更好。为人类提供AI事实核查助手能进一步提高准确性，但辅助方式很重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力提升和处理更复杂任务，验证质量和安全变得更具挑战性。本文探索如何利用AI提高人类监督质量，重点关注人类难以处理的事实核查问题。

Method: 研究结合AI评分和人类评分的方法，特别关注AI评分者的置信度。测试不同类型的AI辅助方式，包括显示AI解释、置信度、标签，以及仅显示搜索结果和证据。

Result: AI与人类结合的事实核查优于单独使用任一方。提供AI助手能提高人类准确性，但显示AI解释、置信度和标签会导致过度依赖，而仅显示搜索结果和证据能培养更适当的信任。

Conclusion: 这些结果对"放大监督"具有启示意义——即结合人类和AI来监督AI系统，即使AI超越人类专家表现。

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发专门针对军事任务的小型本地化模型，满足数据敏感操作需求，支持在隔离边缘设备上部署。

Method: 使用160万高质量军事文档记录对gpt-oss-20b进行微调，并创建四个新的军事测试集进行评估。

Result: 在军事测试集上，EdgeRunner 20B在95%统计显著性下匹配或超越GPT-5，在通用基准测试上无明显回归。

Conclusion: 小型本地化模型是军事领域数据敏感操作的理想解决方案，可在隔离边缘设备上有效部署。

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k
(general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B
matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 住宅需求响应能力需要大幅提升，但现有家庭能源管理系统因用户交互障碍而采用受限，需要将日常偏好转换为技术参数。

Method: 采用分层架构，结合一个协调器和三个专业代理，使用ReAct模式进行迭代推理，集成Google Calendar进行上下文感知的截止时间提取。

Result: 评估显示Llama-3.3-70B在所有场景中成功协调所有电器，与混合整数线性规划计算的最优基准相匹配，而其他模型在单电器调度上表现完美但无法同时协调所有电器。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可作为自主协调器管理从自然语言输入到多电器调度的完整工作流，但无明确指导的分析查询处理仍不可靠，系统已开源以支持可重复性和未来研究。

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规范推理涉及义务和许可等模态概念，虽然LLMs在各种推理任务中表现出色，但其处理规范推理的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 创建了一个涵盖规范和认知领域广泛形式推理模式的新数据集，比较LLMs在规范模态和认知模态推理中的表现，并纳入影响人类推理的非形式认知因素。

Result: LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范推理中表现出显著不一致性，并显示出与心理学研究中观察到的类似认知偏差。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs规范推理中实现逻辑一致性所面临的挑战，为提高其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Motivation: 实现智能体协作解决复杂问题的代理组织时代，让多个智能体通过并发协作产生超越个体智能的成果。

Method: 提出异步思考协议，组织者动态分配子查询给工作者，合并中间知识，产生连贯解决方案，并通过强化学习优化思考结构。

Result: 相比并行思考降低28%推理延迟，在数学推理上提高准确率，且无需额外训练即可泛化到未见任务。

Conclusion: 异步思考是实现代理组织协作的有效范式，能显著提升推理效率和性能，并具备良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

Motivation: 当前LLM代理的工具授权方法过于宽泛，允许代理超出任务范围操作，存在显著安全风险。

Method: 引入委托授权模型，通过语义检查访问请求，生成最小必要范围的访问令牌；创建ASTRA数据集用于任务与权限范围的语义匹配基准测试。

Result: 实验显示基于模型的匹配方法在所需权限范围增加时存在局限性。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究语义匹配技术，实现意图感知授权，包括细粒度控制如基于任务的访问控制(TBAC)。

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型对文本输入的偏好源于其内部注意力机制中视觉键向量与文本键向量的分布差异，而非外部数据因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言数据时表现出明显的文本偏好，限制了其基于视觉证据进行有效推理的能力。传统研究将此归因于数据不平衡或指令调优等外部因素，但本文认为这种偏见源于模型内部架构。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL模型中提取键向量，使用t-SNE进行定性分析和Jensen-Shannon散度进行定量分析，研究视觉键和文本键在注意力空间中的分布结构。

Result: 视觉键向量和文本键向量在注意力空间中占据明显不同的子空间，模态间差异在统计上显著，超过模态内变异的几个数量级。

Conclusion: 文本偏见源于注意力键空间内部的内在错位，而不仅仅是外部数据因素。视觉键向量相对于语言预训练期间学习的文本键空间是分布外的，导致在注意力计算中获得系统性较低的相似性分数。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在列表处理任务中的工作机制，探索它们是否学习到了类似函数式编程的抽象计算操作。

Method: 使用因果中介分析在多样化的列表处理任务上，识别编码过滤谓词的注意力头（称为filter heads）。

Result: 发现少量注意力头在特定token处编码紧凑的谓词表示，这种表示可以跨不同集合、格式、语言和任务重用。

Conclusion: Transformer LMs能够发展出人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，其泛化方式与传统函数式编程模式惊人相似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.
