Abstract: Benchmarking is essential for developing and evaluating black-box optimization algorithms, providing a structured means to analyze their search behavior. Its effectiveness relies on carefully selected problem sets used for evaluation. To date, most established benchmark suites for black-box optimization consist of abstract or synthetic problems that only partially capture the complexities of real-world engineering applications, thereby severely limiting the insights that can be gained for application-oriented optimization scenarios and reducing their practical impact. To close this gap, we propose a new benchmarking suite that addresses it by presenting a curated set of optimization benchmarks rooted in structural mechanics. The current implemented benchmarks are derived from vehicle crashworthiness scenarios, which inherently require the use of gradient-free algorithms due to the non-smooth, highly non-linear nature of the underlying models. Within this paper, the reader will find descriptions of the physical context of each case, the corresponding optimization problem formulations, and clear guidelines on how to employ the suite.

### [2] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个分析框架来研究AI能力在什么条件下会无限增长（失控增长），以及在什么条件下可以排除这种可能性。该框架将能力增长与资源建设和部署策略联系起来，基于物理和信息理论限制定义了一个服务包络线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统在什么可测量的条件下能力会在有限时间内无限制增长（失控增长），以及在什么条件下可以排除这种可能性，用可测试的条件和可部署的控制措施来取代猜测。

Method: 开发了一个递归自我改进的分析框架，将能力增长与资源建设和部署策略联系起来。基于功率、带宽和内存的物理和信息理论限制定义了服务包络线。建立了一个内生增长模型，将资本与计算、数据和能源耦合，定义了超线性和亚临界状态之间的临界边界。

Result: 推导出了决策规则，将可观察的序列（设施功率、IO带宽、训练吞吐量、基准损失和支出）映射为失控行为与非奇异行为的yes/no证书。该框架提供了基于改进速度相对于当前水平加速程度的可证伪测试。

Conclusion: 该研究用可测试的条件和可部署的控制措施取代了对AI奇点的猜测，提供了基于实际工程测量的仿真自由方法，为认证或排除AI奇点提供了理论基础和实践控制手段。

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

Abstract: CAR-Scenes is a frame-level dataset for autonomous driving that enables training and evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs) for interpretable, scene-level understanding. We annotate 5,192 images drawn from Argoverse 1, Cityscapes, KITTI, and nuScenes using a 28-key category/sub-category knowledge base covering environment, road geometry, background-vehicle behavior, ego-vehicle behavior, vulnerable road users, sensor states, and a discrete severity scale (1-10), totaling 350+ leaf attributes. Labels are produced by a GPT-4o-assisted vision-language pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification; we release the exact prompts, post-processing rules, and per-field baseline model performance. CAR-Scenes also provides attribute co-occurrence graphs and JSONL records that support semantic retrieval, dataset triage, and risk-aware scenario mining across sources. To calibrate task difficulty, we include reproducible, non-benchmark baselines, notably a LoRA-tuned Qwen2-VL-2B with deterministic decoding, evaluated via scalar accuracy, micro-averaged F1 for list attributes, and severity MAE/RMSE on a fixed validation split. We publicly release the annotation and analysis scripts, including graph construction and evaluation scripts, to enable explainable, data-centric workflows for future intelligent vehicles.

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了在真实世界模型（如Stable Diffusion）上大规模应用数据归属方法的有意义进展。

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发并验证了首个基于共识的视频评估工具ColoWorkflow，用于微创结直肠手术的工作流程分析，建立了可重复的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微创结直肠手术存在程序变异性大、学习曲线陡峭、并发症影响质量和结果的问题，需要数据驱动的工具来减少变异性、优化培训和改善手术表现。

Method: 通过德尔菲法达成对通用工作流程描述符的共识，开发ColoWorkflow工具，并在多中心视频数据集上进行应用和验证，评估适用性和评分者间信度。

Result: 确定了10个程序无关阶段和34个程序特定步骤，工具在54个手术视频中表现出广泛适用性，评分者间信度中等（阶段K=0.71，步骤K=0.66）。

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow为微创结直肠手术提供了首个基于共识的验证视频评估工具，支持机构间基准测试和AI驱动的工作流程识别发展，有望标准化培训、加速能力获取和推进数据驱动的手术质量改进。

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

Conclusion: 建议未来研究聚焦于多模态深度学习模型，以提供更鲁棒和通用的检测能力，为构建更强防御系统提供明确起点。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Conclusion: FVMGN通过频率域分析和多模态特征对齐，有效解决了遥感多模态泛化问题，在遥感图像分类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The booming remote sensing (RS) technology is giving rise to a novel multimodality generalization task, which requires the model to overcome data heterogeneity while possessing powerful cross-scene generalization ability. Moreover, most vision-language models (VLMs) usually describe surface materials in RS images using universal texts, lacking proprietary linguistic prior knowledge specific to different RS vision modalities. In this work, we formalize RS multimodality generalization (RSMG) as a learning paradigm, and propose a frequency-aware vision-language multimodality generalization network (FVMGN) for RS image classification. Specifically, a diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) strategy is designed to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions, enriching input information for FVMGN. Following that, to overcome multimodal heterogeneity, a multimodal wavelet disentanglement (MWDis) module is developed to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low and high frequency components in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of RS vision modalities, shared and proprietary class texts is designed as linguistic inputs for the transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. For multimodal vision inputs, a spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) is constructed to realize local-global feature reconstruction and representation. Finally, a multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) module is suggested to construct a unified semantic space, ensuring refined multiscale alignment of different text and vision features in spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments show that FVMGN has the excellent multimodality generalization ability compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) significantly reduces computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters, enabling faster adaptation to new tasks with minimal loss in performance. Previous studies have introduced PEFTs tailored for point cloud data, as general approaches are suboptimal. To further reduce the number of trainable parameters, we propose a point-cloud-specific PEFT, termed Graph Features Tuning (GFT), which learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs of the transformer using a lightweight graph convolution network and passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules. Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation tasks show that GFT operates in the same domain, rivalling existing methods, while reducing the trainable parameters.

Result: 与现有方法相比，该方法在保持更好模型精度的同时实现了更高的剪枝率

Conclusion: 该方法为数据有限环境下的模型压缩提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition plays a key role in many domains, including mental health monitoring, educational interaction, and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance. Experiment results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with Weighted F1 scores improving by 3.42% and 5.73%, respectively.

Abstract: Object detection using images or videos captured by drones is a promising technology with significant potential across various industries. However, a major challenge is that drone images are typically taken from high altitudes, making object identification difficult. This paper proposes an effective solution to address this issue. The base model used in the experiments is YOLOv11, the latest object detection model, with a specific implementation based on YOLOv11n. The experimental data were sourced from the widely used and reliable VisDrone dataset, a standard benchmark in drone-based object detection. This paper introduces an enhancement to the Head network of the YOLOv11 algorithm, called the GhostHead Network. The model incorporating this improvement is named YOLO-Drone. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-Drone achieves significant improvements in key detection accuracy metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP (0.5), compared to the original YOLOv11. Specifically, the proposed model recorded a 0.4% increase in Precision, a 0.6% increase in Recall, a 0.5% increase in F1-Score, and a 0.5% increase in mAP (0.5). Additionally, the Inference Speed metric, which measures image processing speed, also showed a notable improvement. These results indicate that YOLO-Drone is a high-performance model with enhanced accuracy and speed compared to YOLOv11. To further validate its reliability, comparative experiments were conducted against other high-performance object detection models, including YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10. The results confirmed that the proposed model outperformed YOLOv8 by 0.1% in mAP (0.5) and surpassed YOLOv9 and YOLOv10 by 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively.

### [14] [PhaseWin Search Framework Enable Efficient Object-Level Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10914)
*Zihan Gu,Ruoyu Chen,Junchi Zhang,Yue Hu,Hua Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhaseWin是一种新颖的阶段窗口搜索算法，用于对象级基础模型的可信区域归因，以近线性复杂度实现接近贪心算法的高忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于子模子集选择的方法虽然忠实度高，但计算效率低，限制了在实际场景中的部署应用。

Method: 采用分阶段的粗到细搜索策略，结合自适应剪枝、窗口化细粒度选择和动态监督机制，替代传统的二次复杂度贪心选择。

Conclusion: PhaseWin为对象级多模态模型建立了可扩展、高忠实度归因的新技术标准。

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种正负提示监督方法，通过优化正负提示来增强基于能量的OOD检测器性能，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有的负提示方法包含过多非ID特征，可能捕获重叠或误导性信息，导致OOD检测性能不佳。

Conclusion: 提出的正负提示监督方法能有效提升OOD检测性能，通过优化提示表示和语义知识传递实现了更好的检测效果。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

TL;DR: 提出HCD框架解决异构架构知识蒸馏问题，通过共享logits整合师生互补特征，使用子logit解耦蒸馏和正交损失来提升学生模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构架构知识蒸馏（如ViT到ResNet18）面临空间特征表示差异的挑战，传统同构KD方法效果不佳，现有异构KD方法计算成本高、设计复杂或过度依赖logit对齐，无法充分利用互补特征。

Method: HCD框架：1) 通过卷积投影器和自适应池化处理学生中间特征；2) 与教师最后一层特征拼接，通过CFM模块映射到共享logits；3) SDD将共享logits分解为n个子logits，与教师logits融合修正分类；4) 引入正交损失确保子logit多样性。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、细粒度数据集（如CUB200）和ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，HCD优于最先进的KD方法。

Conclusion: HCD通过保留学生特定优势并利用教师知识，有效解决了异构知识蒸馏问题，提升了学生模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在医疗领域面临特征异质性挑战，现有方法存在上下文表示学习不完整和层间风格偏差累积两个关键限制。

Method: 引入频域自适应风格重校准的原型构建，解耦内容-风格表示；设计上下文感知的双层原型对齐方法，从编码器和解码器的不同层提取域不变原型。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法表现出显著的性能。

Conclusion: FedBCS通过域不变上下文原型对齐有效解决了联邦学习中的特征异质性问题，提升了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在3D相关任务（如空间认知和物理理解）上表现不佳，这限制了其在机器人和具身智能等现实应用中的潜力。主要原因是3D任务与2D训练之间存在模态差距。

Method: 提出了SandboxVLM框架，包含四个阶段：生成带抽象控制的多视角先验、代理高程、多视角投票和聚类、3D感知推理。通过抽象边界框编码几何结构和物理运动学。

Result: 在零样本设置下，该方法在多个基准测试和VLM骨干网络上表现一致提升，在SAT Real基准上相比基线方法获得8.3%的性能增益。

Conclusion: 为视觉语言模型配备3D抽象能力可以显著增强其3D推理能力，无需额外训练，为通用具身智能开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with 3D-related tasks such as spatial cognition and physical understanding, which are crucial for real-world applications like robotics and embodied agents. We attribute this to a modality gap between the 3D tasks and the 2D training of VLM, which led to inefficient retrieval of 3D information from 2D input. To bridge this gap, we introduce SandboxVLM, a simple yet effective framework that leverages abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and physical kinematics for VLM. Specifically, we design a 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline comprising four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning. Evaluated in zero-shot settings across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones, our approach consistently improves spatial intelligence, achieving an 8.3\% gain on SAT Real compared with baseline methods for instance. These results demonstrate that equipping VLMs with a 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning ability without additional training, suggesting new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 微表情识别对于推断真实情绪至关重要。现有方法面临两个核心挑战：(1)静态外观和动态运动线索的纠缠阻碍模型关注细微运动；(2)现有数据集的文本标签与面部肌肉运动不完全对应，存在语义鸿沟。

Method: 首先构建Uni-MER运动驱动指令数据集，利用光流和动作单元双重约束确保时空一致性和运动对应性。然后设计三专家架构，将面部动态解耦为结构、动态纹理和运动语义三个独立可解释表示。

Conclusion: DEFT-LLM通过运动语义对齐和多专家解耦，有效注入物理先验并利用大语言模型的跨模态推理能力，能够精确捕捉细微情绪线索。

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

Conclusion: LGRLN方法有效解决了视频摘要中的全局依赖和多模态定制问题，在性能和效率方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video content on social media, video summarization has become a crucial task in multimedia processing. However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, we proposed LGRLN reduces inference time and model parameters by 87.8% and 91.7%, respectively. Our codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/LGRLN.

Conclusion: 文本引导的语义指导和连贯时间建模能有效提升弱监督动态面部表情识别的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.

Conclusion: ERMoE为稀疏专家模型引入了一种新的架构原则，直接解决路由不稳定问题，并通过可扩展、可解释的专业化实现改进性能，无需显式平衡损失。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

Conclusion: DMC框架通过解耦模态优化有效缓解了CLIP模型在类增量学习中的分类器偏差问题，DMC-OT进一步通过统计量校准提升了性能，为视觉语言模型的持续学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频LLMs存在时间不一致性问题：帧时序的微小偏移会翻转注意力并抑制相关帧。这源于多模态RoPE引入的逆傅里叶时间核在帧尺度上产生波动，干扰了本应由原始查询键内积控制的注意力。

Method: 提出PAS方法：在多个注意力头上应用相反的小相位偏移，然后聚合它们的输出。该方法保持每个头的频谱幅度，同时通过聚合有效平滑时间核并降低相位敏感性，无需改变位置编码结构。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，在相同token预算下显示出持续改进，计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: PAS为视频LLMs提供了即插即用的鲁棒时间编码升级方案，能够有效解决时间不一致性问题。

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, the theoretical performance benchmark for learned lossless image compression, are often dismissed as impractical due to prohibitive computational cost. This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression. Notably, our approach sets a new benchmark in learned lossless compression, showing a carefully designed AR framework can offer significant gains over existing methods with a small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

TL;DR: CLUE是一个生成模型框架，能够在无需额外数据的情况下通过固定格式提示实现多样化的图像生成，同时保持稳定性。该框架基于Stable Diffusion架构，在医学领域等数据有限的专门领域中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像合成方法在通用领域表现良好，但在医学等专门领域面临数据种类有限、数量不足的挑战。需要开发能够在有限数据集上实现多样化且稳定图像生成的方法。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion架构，引入Style Encoder处理图像和提示生成风格嵌入，并将其输入到U-Net的新第二注意力层中。通过Kullback-Leibler散度在潜在空间中实现图像特征的连续高斯分布表示。

Result: 在中耳炎数据集上，CLUE将FID从46.81降至9.30，召回率从49.60%提升至70.29%。仅使用1000%规模的合成数据训练的分类器F1分数达83.21%，合成数据与真实数据结合时F1分数达94.76%。

Conclusion: CLUE能够在有限数据集上实现多样化且稳定的图像生成，是领域特定应用的有效数据增强方法，在医学图像合成方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

*Jiajun Chen,Sai Cheng,Yutao Yuan,Yirui Zhang,Haitao Yuan,Peng Peng,Yi Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROMISE是一个新颖的多模态框架，通过提示学习和分层对比学习处理模态缺失问题，在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型在真实场景中某些模态缺失时性能显著下降，主要原因是完整多模态数据与不完整模态场景之间的表示学习不一致。现有方法通过相对简单的生成方法处理缺失模态，但无法充分保持跨模态一致性。

Method: PROMISE将多模态提示学习融入分层对比学习框架，配备专门设计的提示注意力机制，动态生成对缺失模态场景的鲁棒且一致的表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验和消融研究表明，PROMISE相比当前最先进的多模态方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: PROMISE通过创新的提示注意力机制和分层对比学习，有效弥合了完整数据与不完整数据之间的表示差距，在处理模态缺失问题上表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

TL;DR: EmoVid是首个专为创意媒体设计的多模态情感标注视频数据集，包含卡通动画、电影片段和动画贴纸，通过情感条件化视频生成技术显著提升了视频生成的情感表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成系统主要关注低层次视觉指标而忽视情感维度，视频领域缺乏专门资源来连接情感理解与生成任务，特别是在风格化和非现实场景中。

Method: 引入EmoVid数据集，包含情感标签、视觉属性和文本标注；通过系统分析揭示视觉特征与情感感知的时空模式；基于这些洞察开发情感条件化视频生成技术，微调Wan2.1模型。

Result: 在文本到视频和图像到视频任务中，生成视频的定量指标和视觉质量均有显著提升。

Conclusion: EmoVid为情感视频计算设立了新基准，不仅为艺术风格视频中的视觉情感分析提供宝贵见解，也为增强视频生成中的情感表达提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

TL;DR: MeCaMIL是一个因果感知的多实例学习框架，通过结构化因果图显式建模人口统计学混杂因素，解决了现有方法缺乏因果可解释性和公平性不足的问题，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法存在两个关键局限：(1) 依赖缺乏因果可解释性的注意力机制；(2) 未能整合患者人口统计学信息，导致跨不同人群的公平性问题，阻碍了临床转化。

Method: 提出MeCaMIL框架，通过结构化因果图显式建模人口统计学混杂因素，利用do-演算和碰撞器结构原则性地进行因果推断，从虚假的人口统计学相关性中分离疾病相关信号。

Result: 在三个基准测试中实现最先进性能：CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946)、TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931)、TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970)。公平性显著提升，人口统计学差异方差平均降低超过65%，对服务不足人群有显著改善。生存预测也表现优异(平均C-index: 0.653)。

Conclusion: MeCaMIL为数字病理学提供了一个原则性的公平、可解释且临床可行的AI框架，因果图结构对性能至关重要，替代设计会导致准确率降低和公平性恶化。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for whole slide image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology, achieving strong diagnostic performance through patch-level feature aggregation. However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了Draft and Refine（DnR）框架，通过问题条件化的利用指标来量化LVLMs对视觉信息的依赖程度，并利用外部视觉专家提供针对性反馈来减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型过度依赖语言先验而非视觉证据，导致产生不接地气或幻觉的响应，缺乏量化衡量模型在推理过程中实际使用视觉信息的方法。

Method: DnR框架包含：1）构建查询条件相关性图来定位问题特定线索；2）通过相关性引导的概率掩码测量依赖度；3）利用外部视觉专家输出（如边界框或掩码）作为视觉线索，重新查询模型选择能最大程度提高利用率的响应。

Result: 在VQA和图像描述基准测试中，DnR框架实现了准确性的持续提升和幻觉现象的减少。

Conclusion: 测量视觉利用率为构建更可解释和证据驱动的多模态智能体系统提供了原则性路径，无需重新训练或架构更改即可增强视觉基础。

Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning abilities, they often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses because they rely too heavily on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence. This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

TL;DR: VisMem是一个受人类认知记忆理论启发的视觉语言模型框架，通过引入短期和长期视觉记忆模块来解决视觉处理瓶颈问题，显著提升了模型在视觉理解、推理和生成任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在复杂视觉任务中存在"视觉处理瓶颈"，容易失去视觉证据的关联性，在长序列生成中缺乏上下文视觉经验。受人类认知记忆理论的启发，需要为模型提供类似人类记忆的动态视觉记忆机制。

Method: 提出VisMem框架，包含两个记忆模块：短期模块用于保持细粒度感知信息，长期模块用于抽象语义整合。这些记忆在推理过程中动态调用，确保模型在思考和生成过程中保持感知保真度和语义一致性。

Result: 在多个视觉基准测试（理解、推理、生成）上的广泛实验表明，VisMem相比原始模型平均性能提升11.8%，并且优于所有对比方法。

Conclusion: VisMem建立了一个新的潜在空间记忆增强范式，通过认知对齐的记忆机制有效解决了视觉语言模型的视觉处理瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

*Sumin Yu,Taesup Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP-Guard是一种针对扩散式文本到图像模型的安全防护方法，通过估计提示词危害性并应用选择性引导掩码，仅在图像的不安全区域进行引导，从而在保证安全性的同时最小化对内容的意外修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时引导方法缺乏自适应性和选择性，无法根据提示词调整引导强度，也无法仅针对图像的不安全区域进行引导。扩散式T2I模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但也容易创建有害内容，引发社会担忧，需要更安全的生成方法。

Method: SP-Guard通过估计提示词的危害程度，并应用选择性引导掩码，仅对图像中的不安全区域进行引导，而不是对整个图像施加统一的引导强度。

Result: 实验表明，SP-Guard比现有方法生成更安全的图像，同时最大限度地减少了对内容的意外修改。

Conclusion: 除了提高安全性外，研究结果还强调了图像生成过程中透明度和可控性的重要性。

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跳跃连接编码器-解码器架构（U-Net变体）在逆问题中仍存在信息丢失问题，限制了细粒度高频细节的恢复。

Method: 利用小波的完美重构特性防止信息退化，同时选择性抑制冗余特征，作为即插即用解码器块集成到各种U-Net变体中。

Result: 在多个裂缝基准测试中，SUPER显著提升了细裂缝（宽度小于4像素）的分割性能，在智能手机图像去噪中也实现了PSNR的适度提升。

Conclusion: SUPER解码器块具有即插即用的通用性，在统一的重构感知框架内实现了高频保真度和全局一致性。

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Method: 使用模拟器和真实世界数据构建基准，通过模型、规则和人工方法在严格质量控制下生成大规模问题，涵盖退化感知场景和标注的协作事件。

Result: 对40个MLLMs的评估显示在协作感知任务中存在显著性能差距，最佳模型平均落后人类24.38%，且在不同任务间表现不一致。微调实验证实了空中协作感知和推理中模拟到真实迁移的可行性。

Conclusion: AirCopBench填补了多智能体协作感知评估的空白，揭示了MLLMs在复杂协作场景中的局限性，并为改进模型性能提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法未能利用胚胎发育的分布先验，且依赖单焦点信息导致胚胎表示不完整，在细胞遮挡情况下容易出现特征模糊问题。

Method: 两阶段扩散框架：1) 训练冻结帧级编码器提取多焦点特征；2) 多焦点特征融合策略构建3D感知形态表示，结合混合语义-边界条件块注入扩散去噪过程。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上达到最先进结果，单次去噪步骤即可获得最佳平均测试性能，准确率分别达到82.8%和81.3%。

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff通过扩散模型和多焦点特征融合有效解决了胚胎发育阶段识别中的特征模糊问题，显著提升了分类准确性。

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

Motivation: 揭示医学AI模型如何无意中编码社会不平等信息，挑战医学图像是中性生物数据的假设。

Method: 使用最先进的架构（DenseNet121、SwinV2-B、MedMamba）在MIMIC-CXR-JPG和CheXpert数据集上训练模型预测健康保险类型，采用基于补丁的遮挡分析定位信号来源。

Result: 模型能准确预测健康保险类型，信号分布在上胸和中胸区域，而非局部化，表明模型可能内化了临床环境、设备差异或护理路径的微妙痕迹。

Conclusion: 这项工作重新定义了医学AI的公平性目标：不仅需要平衡数据集或调整阈值，更需要审视和解构嵌入临床数据本身的社会指纹。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合粒度缓存(HGC)方法，通过在不同计算阶段采用不同粒度的缓存策略来降低可控生成模型的计算开销，显著提高生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可控生成模型在处理控制条件和内容生成时的计算效率低下问题，这些模型通常需要处理控制条件和内容生成的计算需求，导致生成效率普遍较低。

Method: 采用两种缓存策略：(1)粗粒度缓存(块级)-基于特征重用，在模型推理的每一步中动态绕过编码器-解码器块中的冗余计算；(2)细粒度缓存(提示级)-在模块内部工作，重用连续推理步骤中的交叉注意力图，并将其扩展到相邻步骤的相应模块计算中。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证了HGC的有效性，特别是在平衡生成效率和视觉质量方面具有优势。在COCO-Stuff分割基准上，计算成本(MACs)显著降低63%(从18.22T到6.70T)，同时语义保真度损失保持在1.5%以内。

Conclusion: HGC方法能够有效降低可控生成模型的计算开销，显著提高生成效率，同时保持良好的视觉质量，为高效可控生成提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

Motivation: 解决息肉自动分割中的三个关键挑战：(1)小尺寸息肉易被漏检，(2)息肉与周围环境边界模糊，(3)结肠镜图像中的噪声影响分割效果。

Method: 提出三个核心模块：CGMFE模块用于多尺度特征提取和噪声抑制，WCAD解码器模块用于恢复细节和精确定位，DFA模块用于特征聚合和重要性选择以减少小息肉丢失。

Result: 在ETIS-LaribPolypDB和CVC-ColonDB数据集上，mDice分数分别比第二名网络高出2.20%和0.68%，表现优于近期其他网络。

Conclusion: MPCGNet通过耦合门机制有效解决了息肉分割的关键挑战，特别是在小息肉检测和噪声抑制方面表现出色，为结肠息肉筛查提供了更可靠的自动分割方法。

Abstract: Automatic segmentation methods of polyps is crucial for assisting doctors in colorectal polyp screening and cancer diagnosis. Despite the progress made by existing methods, polyp segmentation faces several challenges: (1) small-sized polyps are prone to being missed during identification, (2) the boundaries between polyps and the surrounding environment are often ambiguous, (3) noise in colonoscopy images, caused by uneven lighting and other factors, affects segmentation results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection. Three modules are proposed: the coupling gates multiscale feature extraction (CGMFE) module, which effectively extracts local features and suppresses noise; the windows cross attention (WCAD) decoder module, which restores details after capturing the precise location of polyps; and the decoder feature aggregation (DFA) module, which progressively aggregates features, further extracts them, and performs feature importance selection to reduce the loss of small-sized polyps. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCGNet outperforms recent networks, with mDice scores 2.20% and 0.68% higher than the second-best network on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB datasets, respectively.

*Pooja Singh,Siddhant Ujjain,Tapan Kumar Gandhi,Sandeep Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossMed是一个评估医学多模态大语言模型组合泛化能力的基准，使用模态-解剖-任务(MAT)框架，将四个公共数据集转换为统一的视觉问答格式，包含20,200个多项选择题实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学多模态大模型在未见过的成像模态、解剖结构和任务类型组合上的泛化能力尚未充分探索，需要专门的基准来评估其组合泛化能力。

Method: 将CheXpert、SIIM-ACR、BraTS 2020和MosMedData四个数据集重新格式化为统一的视觉问答格式，使用MAT模式构建相关、不相关和零重叠三种测试分割，评估LLaVA-Vicuna-7B和Qwen2-VL-7B等模型。

Result: 在相关分割上模型达到83.2%分类准确率和0.75分割cIoU，但在不相关和零重叠条件下性能显著下降。跨任务迁移显示仅使用分类数据训练也能提升分割性能7% cIoU。

Conclusion: CrossMed为评估医学视觉语言模型的零样本、跨任务和模态无关泛化能力提供了严格的测试平台，多模态大模型在组合泛化方面表现独特优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

TL;DR: SemanticNN是一个面向资源受限物联网设备的语义级编解码器，能够在动态信道条件下实现压缩且容错的协作推理卸载，显著减少特征传输量同时保持高推理精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网设备上AI部署的增长，传统方法关注比特级传输正确性在动态信道条件下效率低下，需要能够在严格计算和通信约束下实现容错的设备-边缘协作系统。

Method: 提出SemanticNN语义编解码器，包含BER感知解码器适应动态信道条件、软量化编码器学习紧凑表示、特征增强学习训练策略，以及XAI不对称补偿解决编码器-解码器能力不匹配问题。

Conclusion: SemanticNN通过语义级容错方法有效解决了资源受限物联网设备在动态信道条件下的协作推理问题，显著提升了传输效率和系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出H²ARN网络解决文本-3D检索中的层次表示崩溃和冗余诱导显著性稀释问题，通过在双曲空间中嵌入数据和层次对齐推理来提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本-3D检索方法面临层次表示崩溃(HRC)和冗余诱导显著性稀释(RISD)两大挑战，HRC压缩了抽象到具体、整体到部分的层次结构，RISD平均噪声片段模糊了关键语义线索。

Method: H²ARN在洛伦兹模型双曲空间中嵌入文本和3D数据，使用层次排序损失构建收缩蕴含锥，实例级对比损失分离不匹配样本，贡献感知双曲聚合模块利用洛伦兹距离评估局部特征相关性。

Conclusion: H²ARN通过双曲层次对齐推理有效解决了HRC和RISD问题，提升了文本-3D检索的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the daily influx of 3D data on the internet, text-3D retrieval has gained increasing attention. However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes. Our codes are available at https://github.com/liwrui/H2ARN.

TL;DR: PINGS-X是一个基于轴向对齐时空高斯表示的新型框架，用于4D血流MRI的超分辨率重建，显著减少训练时间同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统4D血流MRI需要高时空分辨率来检测心血管疾病，但高分辨率导致扫描时间过长。现有物理信息神经网络方法训练缓慢且需为每个患者单独训练，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出PINGS-X框架，扩展3D高斯溅射概念，包含：(i)具有形式收敛保证的归一化高斯溅射；(ii)轴向对齐高斯简化高维数据训练；(iii)高斯合并程序防止退化解并提升计算效率。

Conclusion: PINGS-X通过创新的高斯表示方法，有效解决了4D血流MRI超分辨率重建中的训练效率问题，为心血管诊断提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.

*Chuheng Chen,Xiaofei Zhou,Geyuan Zhang,Yong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NP-LoRA方法，通过零空间投影解决LoRA融合中的结构干扰问题，实现更好的主题保真度和风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA融合方法依赖权重合并，导致一个LoRA主导另一个，造成干扰和保真度下降。这是因为单独训练的LoRA占据低秩高维子空间，产生非正交和重叠的表示。

Method: 分析LoRA内部结构，发现生成行为由低秩子空间中的少数主方向主导。提出NP-LoRA框架：通过SVD提取主风格方向，将主题LoRA投影到其正交零空间，并引入软投影机制平衡保真度和一致性。

Result: 实验表明NP-LoRA在融合质量上持续优于强基线（DINO和CLIP指标、人类和LLM偏好分数），且无需重新训练即可广泛应用于不同骨干网络和LoRA对。

Conclusion: NP-LoRA通过强制子空间分离有效防止主方向间的结构干扰，为可控生成提供了更优的LoRA融合解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fusion has emerged as a key technique for reusing and composing learned subject and style representations for controllable generation without costly retraining. However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency. Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines (e.g., DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with human and LLM preference scores), and applies broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.

Result: 在MVImgNet和MureCom数据集上的大量实验表明，生成模型能从校准的参考特征中显著受益

Conclusion: 多参考生成式图像合成方法通过特征校准有效解决了细节保持与前景调整的平衡问题

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

TL;DR: LiteAttention通过利用扩散注意力在去噪步骤间的时空一致性，实现进化式计算跳过，在保持视频生成质量的同时显著降低注意力计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散变换器在视频生成中存在二次注意力复杂度问题，导致延迟过高。动态稀疏注意力方法计算开销大且存在估计误差，而静态稀疏模式在整个去噪过程中保持固定且往往不是最优的。

Method: 识别扩散注意力具有跨去噪步骤的强时空一致性特性，提出LiteAttention方法：早期标记非必要tile并向前传播跳过决策，消除冗余注意力计算，无需重复分析开销。

Result: 在FlashAttention基础上实现高度优化的LiteAttention内核，在生产级视频扩散模型上实现显著加速，且无质量损失。

Conclusion: LiteAttention结合了动态方法的适应性和静态方法的效率，为扩散变换器提供了一种高效的注意力加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with early detection critical for reducing vision loss worldwide. Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI. Beyond DR, many of the surveyed innovations extend broadly to medical imaging at scale.

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU X-Ray基准测试中达到最先进性能，消融研究验证了多阶段辅助引导方法的有效性

Conclusion: S2D-Align为增强复杂多模态生成任务中的基础能力提供了一个有前景的方向

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

Conclusion: 扩散模型在连续潜在空间中表现最佳，但自回归模型在离散潜在空间中具有竞争力，为不同应用场景提供了模型选择依据。

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

Result: 最佳配置达到0.754的平均AUC，优于或相当于先前基于胸片的研究，证明DRRs作为训练基础的有效性。

Conclusion: DRRs为冠状动脉钙化检测提供了可扩展、标签丰富的训练基础，为未来向真实胸片的迁移学习和域适应奠定了基础。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.

Abstract: Bark beetle infestations represent a serious challenge for maintaining the health of coniferous forests. This paper proposes a few-shot learning approach leveraging contrastive learning to detect bark beetle infestations using satellite PRISMA hyperspectral data. The methodology is based on a contrastive learning framework to pre-train a one-dimensional CNN encoder, enabling the extraction of robust feature representations from hyperspectral data. These extracted features are subsequently utilized as input to support vector regression estimators, one for each class, trained on few labeled samples to estimate the proportions of healthy, attacked by bark beetle, and dead trees for each pixel. Experiments on the area of study in the Dolomites show that our method outperforms the use of original PRISMA spectral bands and of Sentinel-2 data. The results indicate that PRISMA hyperspectral data combined with few-shot learning offers significant advantages for forest health monitoring.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Conclusion: OT-ALD有效解决了潜在分布不匹配问题，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了翻译效率。

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

Conclusion: AlignVQA框架通过多智能体辩论和校准优化，有效提升了VQA系统的置信度校准性能，使模型置信度更准确地反映其真实预测能力。

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

Result: 在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上的实验验证了HinD的有效性，使用7B规模MLLM的推理能力达到了优越性能。

Conclusion: HinD框架成功激发了MLLMs的内部知识推理能力，在KBVQA任务中实现了无需外部知识或商业API的优异表现，为知识推理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Conclusion: 混响变换具有作为通用延迟建模方法的潜力，能够实现可控的轨迹预测并揭示智能体的延迟行为模式。

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

TL;DR: 提出D-GAP方法，通过在幅度空间和像素空间进行目标增强来提高模型的跨域鲁棒性，解决传统增强方法在真实世界域偏移下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界计算机视觉应用中，图像背景、风格和采集设备的偏移会降低模型性能。传统增强方法在这种偏移下表现不一致，而数据集特定增强需要专家知识。神经网络对域偏移适应能力差，因为它们对域特定频率分量存在学习偏差。

Method: D-GAP方法：1）在频率空间中基于任务梯度计算敏感度图，反映模型对不同频率分量的响应强度；2）使用敏感度图自适应地在源样本和目标样本之间插值幅度；3）通过像素空间混合过程恢复精细空间细节。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集和三个域适应基准上的实验表明，D-GAP始终优于通用和数据集特定增强方法，在真实世界数据集上平均OOD性能提升+5.3%，在基准数据集上提升+1.8%。

Conclusion: D-GAP通过同时处理频率空间和像素空间的增强，有效减少了模型的学习偏差，显著提高了跨域鲁棒性，为处理真实世界域偏移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness is challenging to achieve in real-world computer vision applications, where shifts in image background, style, and acquisition instruments always degrade model performance. Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法无法区分异常类型，且需要为每个对象类别训练单独模型，成本高昂。大型视觉语言模型虽然能解决此问题但计算资源需求大，不适合实时或嵌入式系统。

Method: 使用简单的卷积框架，仅需图像级标签学习生成多通道热图，每个通道对应特定异常类型，作为统一框架处理多个对象类别。

Result: 在Real-IAD数据集上评估，与最先进复杂模型竞争性结果，同时显著降低参数负载和推理时间。

Conclusion: 为计算资源受限的实际应用提供了高度实用和可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Result: 实验结果表明AUVIC实现了最先进的目标遗忘率，同时对非目标概念的性能影响最小。

Conclusion: AUVIC成功解决了MLLMs中视觉概念遗忘的挑战，为数据隐私保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本到图像扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊性，提出了多模态标志性概念，开发了区分识别与实现的评估框架，发现模型在文化参考方面既会复制也会重新诠释，且文化对齐与训练数据频率、文本独特性、参考流行度和创建日期相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊性问题，特别关注多模态标志性现象，即图像和文本唤起文化共享关联的情况，如标题唤起熟悉艺术品或电影场景。

Method: 引入评估框架分离识别（模型是否识别参考）与实现（如何通过复制或重新诠释来描绘），量化两个维度；评估五个扩散模型在767个来自Wikidata的文化参考上；进行提示扰动实验使用同义词替换和字面图像描述。

Result: 框架比现有基于相似性的方法更有效地区分复制与转换；模型即使文本线索改变也经常复制标志性视觉结构；文化对齐不仅与训练数据频率相关，还与文本独特性、参考流行度和创建日期相关。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的价值不仅在于复制内容，还在于如何转换和重新语境化文化知识，推动评估超越简单的文本-图像匹配，实现更丰富的语境理解。

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

TL;DR: VRD-UQA是一个评估视觉大语言模型对视觉丰富文档中不可回答问题检测能力的基准，通过自动修改现有VQA数据集的问题来测试模型在概念替换、文档元素和布局变化等维度上的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然VLLMs在多页视觉丰富文档的视觉问答方面表现出色，但它们检测不可回答问题的能力仍是一个开放的研究问题。本研究旨在探索VLLMs对看似合理但实际无法回答的问题的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过替换原始自然语言实体为同类型的其他实体，属于不同文档元素和不同布局位置或页面，生成不可回答的问题。使用VLLM-as-a-judge方法验证问题的不可回答性，并在12个模型上进行多维度实验分析。

Result: 实验揭示了VLLMs在检测不可回答问题方面的局限性，特别是在页面和文档级别的准确性、不同类型损坏的影响以及不同知识注入策略的有效性方面。

Conclusion: VRD-UQA可以作为开发鲁棒文档VQA系统的评估框架，帮助识别和改进VLLMs在不可回答问题检测方面的能力。

Abstract: The evolution of Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) has revolutionized the automatic understanding of Visually Rich Documents (VRDs), which contain both textual and visual elements. Although VLLMs excel in Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-page VRDs, their ability to detect unanswerable questions is still an open research question. Our research delves into the robustness of the VLLMs to plausible yet unanswerable questions, i.e., questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions caused by swaps between related concepts or plausible question formulations. Corruptions are generated by replacing the original natural language entities with other ones of the same type, belonging to different document elements, and in different layout positions or pages of the related document. To this end, we present VRD-UQA (VISUALLY RICH DOCUMENT UNANSWERABLE QUESTION ANSWERING), a benchmark for evaluating VLLMs' resilience to plausible yet unanswerable questions across multiple dimensions. It automatically alters the questions of existing VQA datasets consisting of multi-page VRDs, verifies their unanswerability using a VLLM-as-a-judge approach, and then thoroughly evaluates VLLMs' performance. Experiments, run on 12 models, analyze: (1) The VLLMs' accuracy in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels; (2) The effect of different types of corruption (NLP entity, document element, layout); (3) The effectiveness of different knowledge injection strategies based on in-context learning (OCR, multi-page selection, or the possibility of unanswerability). Our findings reveal VLLMs' limitations and demonstrate that VRD-UQA can serve as an evaluation framework for developing resilient document VQA systems.

### [70] [Dynamic Gaussian Scene Reconstruction from Unsynchronized Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11175)
*Zhixin Xu,Hengyu Zhou,Yuan Liu,Wenhan Xue,Hao Pan,Wenping Wang,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于非同步多视角视频4D高斯溅射重建的时序对齐策略，通过粗到精的对齐模块估计和补偿相机时间偏移，提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中多视角视频常因相机触发延迟或独立录制设置导致时序不同步，而现有4DGS方法假设输入视频流已同步，这限制了重建质量。

Method: 采用粗到精对齐模块，先估计帧级粗偏移，再细化到亚帧精度，可作为即插即用模块集成到现有4DGS框架中。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效处理时序未对齐视频，显著提升基线方法性能。

Conclusion: 该时序对齐策略增强了4DGS对异步数据的鲁棒性，为现实场景的多视角视频重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

Result: 在图像生成和编辑任务上的广泛实验表明，ImAgent持续优于骨干模型，甚至在骨干模型失败的情况下超越其他强基线。

Conclusion: 统一多模态代理在测试时扩展下具有实现自适应和高效图像生成的潜力。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Viper-F1实现了准确、细粒度的理解，并显著提高了效率。

Conclusion: Viper-F1通过状态空间方法和视觉定位增强，在保持高效推理的同时实现了细粒度的视觉语言理解。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，研究发现模型在幻觉预测时倾向于忽略图像而依赖先前生成的标记进行推理。

Method: 引入Prelim Attention Score (PAS)，通过计算对prelim标记的注意力权重来量化图像依赖程度，该信号轻量且无需额外前向传播。

Result: PAS在多个模型和数据集上实现了最先进的物体幻觉检测性能，能够实时进行过滤和干预。

Conclusion: PAS是一种有效的训练无关方法，通过利用先前被忽视的注意力信号来检测和缓解LVLM中的物体幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

Abstract: This paper is a submission for the Weather4Cast~2025 complementary Pollution Task and presents an efficient framework for 6-hour lead-time nowcasting of PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ across the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions. The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型取得了显著进展，但其在保持语义不变的小幅输入变化下的可靠性尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在系统评估VLM对良性扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过大规模实验，测试了多种VLM对像素级位移、几何变换、缩放、改写和多语言重写等良性扰动的敏感性，分析了稳定性在不同扰动类型、问题类别和模型间的变化规律。

Result: 研究发现现代VLM对微小扰动高度敏感，即使是最先进模型（如GPT-4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash）也经常在像素级位移或无害改写下失败。样本稳定性是正确性的强指标，稳定样本更可能被正确回答。

Conclusion: 当前VLM存在根本性脆弱性，需要超越对抗性扰动的鲁棒性评估，重点关注模型应可靠保持的不变性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Conclusion: 这项工作为3D视觉中的多目标威胁建立了关键基准，为保护未来3D驱动的智能系统提供了基础理解。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Conclusion: GSD框架有效解决了稀疏视角下3D高斯溅射的过拟合问题，提升了多视角一致性

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: 多模态模型中的位置偏见由位置编码方案、训练损失、上下文重要性以及图像-文本对的使用等多种因素共同导致或放大。

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

### [82] [DoReMi: A Domain-Representation Mixture Framework for Generalizable 3D Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11232)
*Mingwei Xing,Xinliang Wang,Yifeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoReMi是一个混合专家框架，通过联合建模领域感知专家分支和统一表示分支，解决多源点云异构性问题，实现专业知识和泛化能力的协同学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D深度学习在多领域泛化受限，主要由于数据集规模有限和多源点云的高度异构性。不同传感器采集的点云在密度和噪声分布上存在显著差异，导致多领域融合时出现负迁移。现有方法大多只关注领域感知或领域通用特征，忽视了二者之间的协同潜力。

Method: 提出DoReMi框架：1）领域感知专家分支通过领域引导空间路由动态激活，实现上下文感知的专家选择；2）使用熵控制动态分配实现稳定高效的专家利用；3）通过鲁棒多属性自监督学习预训练的冻结统一表示分支，保持跨领域几何和结构先验。

Result: 在多个3D理解基准测试中评估，DoReMi在ScanNet Val上达到80.1% mIoU，在S3DIS上达到77.2% mIoU，表现出与现有方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: DoReMi展示了作为未来3D理解研究基础框架的强大潜力，能够自适应地建模多样化领域分布，同时保持全局一致性。

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在显著减少LoRA参数的情况下，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MoE LoRA框架能够有效解决小样本风格编辑问题，在参数效率和性能方面都表现出色。

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

TL;DR: GEODE是一个解决视觉语言模型3D空间理解瓶颈的新架构，通过解耦3D推理和数值生成，在1.5B参数下实现与7B+模型相当的3D空间推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间智能理解上存在双重瓶颈：输入阶段几何感知编码器计算成本高与2D特征浅层化的冲突，输出阶段离散分词器无法生成精确连续数值。

Method: 引入GEODE架构，包含两个即插即用模块：解耦推理模块（DRM）作为空间协处理器，通过交叉注意力对齐3D数据和2D特征，并蒸馏空间思维链逻辑；直接回归头（DRH）使用"嵌入即值"范式，通过轻量MLP精确回归标量和3D边界框。

Result: 1.5B参数的模型作为高级语义分发器，在空间推理性能上达到最先进水平，可与7B+模型相媲美。

Conclusion: GEODE通过解耦3D推理和数值生成，有效解决了视觉语言模型在3D空间理解上的双重瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Arcee提出了一种跨块循环状态链，通过重用每个块的终端状态空间表示作为下一块的初始条件，改进了Mamba模型在视觉任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Mamba选择性扫描操作在每个块重新初始化状态空间动态，丢弃了前一个块的终端状态空间表示，这限制了模型的信息流动和性能。

Method: Arcee构建了一个可微分的边界映射，将每个块的终端状态空间表示作为下一块的初始条件，实现跨块的梯度流动，且与现有视觉Mamba变体兼容且参数免费。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ（256×256）无条件生成任务中，Arcee将FID从82.81显著降低到15.33（5.4倍改进）。

Conclusion: Arcee通过跨块状态重用提供了一种有效的方向性先验，显著提升了视觉Mamba模型的性能，且实现成本可忽略。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), Mamba in particular, are increasingly adopted for long-context sequence modeling, providing linear-time aggregation via an input-dependent, causal selective-scan operation. Along this line, recent "Mamba-for-vision" variants largely explore multiple scan orders to relax strict causality for non-sequential signals (e.g., images). Rather than preserving cross-block memory, the conventional formulation of the selective-scan operation in Mamba reinitializes each block's state-space dynamics from zero, discarding the terminal state-space representation (SSR) from the previous block. Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain, reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Handoff across blocks is constructed as a differentiable boundary map whose Jacobian enables end-to-end gradient flow across terminal boundaries. Key to practicality, Arcee is compatible with all prior "vision-mamba" variants, parameter-free, and incurs constant, negligible cost. As a modeling perspective, we view terminal SSR as a mild directional prior induced by a causal pass over the input, rather than an estimator of the non-sequential signal itself. To quantify the impact, for unconditional generation on CelebA-HQ (256$\times$256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID$\downarrow$ from $82.81$ to $15.33$ ($5.4\times$ lower) on a single scan-order Zigzag Mamba baseline. Efficient CUDA kernels and training code will be released to support rigorous and reproducible research.

TL;DR: CountSteer是一种无需训练的方法，通过引导扩散模型在推理过程中的交叉注意力隐藏状态，提高文本到图像生成中对象数量控制的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型能生成逼真连贯的图像，但经常无法遵循文本中的数字指令，这揭示了语言和视觉表示之间的差距。研究发现这些模型并非完全对数字无感知，它们隐式地了解自己的计数准确性。

Method: 基于模型内部已经编码了数值正确性的潜在概念这一发现，CountSteer在推理过程中引导模型的交叉注意力隐藏状态，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验显示CountSteer将对象计数准确性提高了约4%，且不损害视觉质量。

Conclusion: CountSteer展示了向更可控和语义可靠的文本到图像生成迈出的简单而有效的一步。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过分组caption tokens来获取细粒度视觉语言表示的方法，该方法将语言表示与图像中的对象级别对齐，提高了模型对视觉和语言的细粒度理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注图像块与语言token的对齐，但图像块对人眼无意义，单个token也不一定携带可ground的图像信息。需要将token分组来描述场景的不同方面，以获得更好的细粒度知识理解。

Method: 提出了一种模型架构，在模型中自动对caption tokens进行分组，以捕获语言的细粒度表示。将这些表示与经过训练发现对象的图像编码器输出对齐，使表示达到图像中对象的级别。

Result: 通过学习token分组，视觉语言模型对视觉和语言有了更好的细粒度理解。模型发现的token组在定性和定量上都与文本中的可ground短语高度相似。

Conclusion: 通过token分组的方法能够有效提升视觉语言模型的细粒度理解能力，发现的token组与真实可ground短语具有高度一致性。

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: 在LangAuto基准测试中，场景图条件化使最先进方法的驾驶性能获得大幅持续提升，即使测试时不需要场景图输入。

Conclusion: 场景图条件化训练能让模型更好地内化和基于关系先验知识，显著提升自动驾驶性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as effective backbones for many vision tasks. However, current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, such as geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $Φ$eat, a novel physically-grounded visual backbone that encourages a representation sensitive to material identity, including reflectance cues and geometric mesostructure. Our key idea is to employ a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions. While similar data have been used in high-end supervised tasks such as intrinsic decomposition or material estimation, we demonstrate that a pure self-supervised training strategy, without explicit labels, already provides a strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors. We evaluate the learned representations through feature similarity analysis and material selection, showing that $Φ$eat captures physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping. These findings highlight the promise of unsupervised physical feature learning as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

Conclusion: 通过协调学习框架，CORAL能够学习解剖感知的表示，有利于下游分割任务，并捕获跨患者共享的规范解剖流形。

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Abstract: Gaze redirection methods aim to generate realistic human face images with controllable eye movement. However, recent methods often struggle with 3D consistency, efficiency, or quality, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we propose RTGaze, a real-time and high-quality gaze redirection method. Our approach learns a gaze-controllable facial representation from face images and gaze prompts, then decodes this representation via neural rendering for gaze redirection. Additionally, we distill face geometric priors from a pretrained 3D portrait generator to enhance generation quality. We evaluate RTGaze both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in efficiency, redirection accuracy, and image quality across multiple datasets. Our system achieves real-time, 3D-aware gaze redirection with a feedforward network (~0.06 sec/image), making it 800x faster than the previous state-of-the-art 3D-aware methods.

Conclusion: SimuFreeMark通过利用低频分量的稳定性，实现了无需噪声模拟的鲁棒水印嵌入，具有更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices.

Conclusion: 该数据集以结构化格式提供原始事件流和预计算的最优表示，便于即时研究使用和可复现基准测试。

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.
  The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/paroj/ycbev_sd.

*Sheng Liu,Yuanzhi Liang,Sidan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free3D是一个无需3D运动标注的3D人体运动生成框架，通过2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜在空间，使用3D无监督正则化目标实现视图一致性、方向连贯性和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体运动生成模型虽然重建精度高，但难以泛化到训练分布之外，这源于精确的3D监督使模型过度拟合固定坐标模式，而非学习本质的3D结构和运动语义线索。

Method: 提出Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ)将2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜在空间，并设计了一套3D无监督正则化目标，包括视图一致性、方向连贯性和物理合理性约束。

Result: 仅使用2D运动数据训练，Free3D能生成多样化、时间连贯且语义对齐的3D运动，性能达到甚至超过完全3D监督的模型。

Conclusion: 放松显式3D监督能促进更强的结构推理和泛化能力，为3D运动生成提供了可扩展和数据高效的范式。

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合隐马尔可夫随机场(HMRF)理论和CNN分割的方法，实现无监督学习和快速分割，在PU泡沫μCT图像数据集上达到高精度分割，并提出了减少标注数据需求的预训练策略。

Conclusion: HMRF-UNet方法成功结合了无监督学习和快速分割的优势，在材料图像分割任务中表现出色，预训练策略有效降低了数据标注需求。

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

Motivation: 视频情感计算面临模型不稳定和表征退化问题，核心限制是缺乏分层结构机制来解耦不同的情感成分（情感基和瞬时波动）。

Method: 提出LSEF框架：稳定性编码模块捕获低秩情感基，动态解耦模块分离稀疏瞬时信号，一致性集成模块重建多尺度稳定性与反应性一致性，使用秩感知优化策略平衡梯度平滑性和敏感性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，LSEF显著增强了鲁棒性和动态判别能力，验证了分层低秩稀疏建模理解情感动态的有效性和普适性。

Conclusion: LSEF通过分层低秩稀疏建模成功解决了情感动态理解中的稳定性和表征退化问题，为情感计算提供了有效的理论框架。

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要建立一个系统性的评估框架来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出三层次评估框架：粗粒度质量评分、中粒度失真类型识别（单选和多选测试）、细粒度失真强度分类。使用思维链提示来提升性能。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs具备初步的DIQA能力，但存在评分不一致、失真误识别和强度误判等关键限制。思维链提示在所有层次上都显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为MLLMs的DIQA能力提供了基准测试，揭示了其在质量感知方面的明显不足，并指出了改进的可行路径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA是一种用于类增量学习的新框架，通过仅调整CLIP的跨模态桥接层，无需额外参数即可实现稳定知识积累，并利用正交低秩融合防止遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP在类增量学习中面临的两个挑战：避免因添加可学习模块而增加模型复杂度和遗忘风险，以及更有效地整合视觉和文本模态的互补优势。

Method: 在CLIP的跨模态桥接层进行适配，使用正交低秩融合机制将参数更新限制在低秩安全子空间，并结合跨模态混合原型（稳定文本原型与视觉原型）。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，BOFA相比现有方法实现了更高的准确率和效率。

Conclusion: BOFA通过在CLIP桥接层进行受限适配，无需数据回放即可实现稳定知识积累，为类增量学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应教学范式来解决视觉-脑电信号不对称对齐问题，通过让视觉模态（教师）动态调整知识结构来匹配脑电模态（学生）的能力，在零样本脑到图像检索任务中达到60.2%的top-1准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉和脑电模态之间存在根本性的不对称性，包括保真度差距（EEG噪声与视觉高保真特征）和语义差距（EEG浅层概念表示与视觉丰富语义深度）。现有方法忽视这种不对称性，导致泛化性能差。

Method: 提出自适应教学范式，通过ShrinkAdapter模块实现。该模块采用无残差设计和瓶颈结构，让视觉模态动态调整其语义密集特征以适应脑电模态的容量。

Result: 在零样本脑到图像检索任务中达到60.2%的top-1准确率，比之前最先进方法提升了9.8%。

Conclusion: 教师必须缩小和适应来弥合视觉-脑电差距，为不对称对齐提供了新视角。

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) requires models to localize objects in images based on natural language descriptions. Research on the area remains predominantly English-centric, despite increasing global deployment demands. This work addresses multilingual REC through two main contributions. First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks, e.g. achieving 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, compared to an English-only result of 91.3%. Multilingual evaluation shows consistent capabilities across languages, establishing the practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

Motivation: 当前基于扩散的解码器直接使用fMRI特征，忽略了大脑的层次处理结构，模糊了早期、中期和晚期视觉区域的不同作用。

Method: 使用ROI适配器将fMRI分组为早期/中期/晚期流，构建与U-Net深度对齐的多尺度皮层金字塔，通过轻量级ControlNet在去噪过程中注入尺度特定提示。

Conclusion: 按皮层层次结构组织条件是一种强大的替代纯数据驱动嵌入的方法，为研究视觉皮层提供了有用的视角。

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

TL;DR: VP-Bench是一个评估多模态大语言模型理解和利用视觉提示能力的基准测试，包含感知评估和下游任务评估两个阶段，测试了28个模型在8种形状和355种属性组合下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs缺乏对视觉提示（如边界框）理解能力的系统性评估，而这是人类直观的交互方式，需要明确当前模型是否能有效识别和利用这些视觉提示。

Method: 采用两阶段评估框架：第一阶段评估模型在自然场景中感知视觉提示的能力，使用30k个可视化提示；第二阶段评估视觉提示对下游任务的影响。

Result: 评估了28个MLLMs（包括GPT-4o、InternVL3、Qwen2.5-VL等），分析了影响VP理解的因素，如VP属性变化、问题安排和模型规模。

Conclusion: VP-Bench为研究MLLMs如何理解和解决基于视觉提示的问题建立了新的参考框架。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

Conclusion: 使用受控生成的合成数据进行微调是解决视觉语言模型微调中偏差和分布不平衡问题的有效方法，能够显著提升模型在真实世界数据上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

Abstract: We introduce VoxTell, a vision-language model for text-prompted volumetric medical image segmentation. It maps free-form descriptions, from single words to full clinical sentences, to 3D masks. Trained on 62K+ CT, MRI, and PET volumes spanning over 1K anatomical and pathological classes, VoxTell uses multi-stage vision-language fusion across decoder layers to align textual and visual features at multiple scales. It achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across modalities on unseen datasets, excelling on familiar concepts while generalizing to related unseen classes. Extensive experiments further demonstrate strong cross-modality transfer, robustness to linguistic variations and clinical language, as well as accurate instance-specific segmentation from real-world text.

### [109] [Rethinking Efficient Mixture-of-Experts for Remote Sensing Modality-Missing Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11460)
*Qinghao Gao,Jianhai Qu,Yunsong Li,Weiqiang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaMOL框架，将模态缺失重新定义为多任务学习问题，通过双路由机制实现参数高效的自适应，在遥感多模态分类中表现出优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Motivation: 解决遥感多模态分类中因环境干扰、传感器故障等导致的模态缺失问题，现有两阶段适应方法计算成本高且假设训练时数据完整，限制了在实际不完整场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出缺失感知的混合LoRA框架，包含任务导向的动态路由器和模态特定共享的静态路由器，通过轻量级专家更新和共享专家重用实现参数高效适应。

Result: 在多个遥感基准测试中，在不同缺失率下表现出优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力，计算开销最小。在自然图像数据集上的迁移实验验证了其可扩展性和跨领域适用性。

Conclusion: MaMOL为不完整多模态学习提供了一个通用且高效的解决方案，具有出色的跨领域应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

*Yijie Kang,Xinliang Wang,Zhenyu Wu,Yifeng Shi,Hailong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sat2RealCity是一个从真实卫星图像生成3D城市的框架，通过基于OSM的空间先验、外观引导控制和MLLM语义引导，解决了现有方法对大规模3D城市资产依赖和缺乏真实外观连接的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D城市生成方法面临两个主要挑战：需要大规模3D城市资产进行监督训练（获取困难且成本高），以及依赖语义或高度图（缺乏与现实世界外观的连接，限制了生成城市的真实性和泛化能力）。

Method: 1) 引入基于OSM的空间先验策略，实现从空间拓扑到建筑实例的可解释几何生成；2) 设计外观引导的可控建模机制，实现细粒度外观真实性和风格控制；3) 构建MLLM驱动的语义引导生成流程，桥接语义解释和几何重建。

Result: 大量定量和定性实验表明，Sat2RealCity在结构一致性和外观真实性方面显著超越现有基线方法，为现实世界对齐的3D城市内容创建奠定了坚实基础。

Conclusion: Sat2RealCity通过基于建筑实体的生成方法，利用3D对象生成的丰富先验知识，大幅减少了对大规模3D城市资产的依赖，实现了更真实、可控的3D城市生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have substantially enhanced 3D urban generation, enabling applications in digital twins, virtual cities, and large-scale simulations. However, existing methods face two key challenges: (1) the need for large-scale 3D city assets for supervised training, which are difficult and costly to obtain, and (2) reliance on semantic or height maps, which are used exclusively for generating buildings in virtual worlds and lack connection to real-world appearance, limiting the realism and generalizability of generated cities. To address these limitations, we propose Sat2RealCity, a geometry-aware and appearance-controllable framework for 3D urban generation from real-world satellite imagery. Unlike previous city-level generation methods, Sat2RealCity builds generation upon individual building entities, enabling the use of rich priors and pretrained knowledge from 3D object generation while substantially reducing dependence on large-scale 3D city assets. Specifically, (1) we introduce the OSM-based spatial priors strategy to achieve interpretable geometric generation from spatial topology to building instances; (2) we design an appearance-guided controllable modeling mechanism for fine-grained appearance realism and style control; and (3) we construct an MLLM-powered semantic-guided generation pipeline, bridging semantic interpretation and geometric reconstruction. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Sat2RealCity significantly surpasses existing baselines in structural consistency and appearance realism, establishing a strong foundation for real-world aligned 3D urban content creation. The code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nnUNet-B是一个贝叶斯分割框架，通过多模态后验采样直接从H&E染色组织学图像推断PD-L1表达，提供准确分割和认知不确定性估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于免疫组织化学的PD-L1表达评估方法资源密集，需要更高效、可扩展的解决方案

Method: 基于nnUNet-v2构建，在循环训练期间采样多样化模型检查点来近似后验分布，通过熵和标准差进行不确定性估计

Result: 在肺鳞状细胞癌数据集上，平均Dice分数0.805，平均IoU 0.709，性能与现有基线相当，同时提供像素级不确定性图谱

Conclusion: 基于H&E的不确定性感知PD-L1预测是向临床工作流程中可扩展、可解释生物标志物评估迈出的有前景的一步

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

TL;DR: OpenUS是首个基于大规模公共数据的可复现开源超声基础模型，采用视觉Mamba架构和自适应掩码框架，在308K超声图像上预训练，支持标签高效的下游任务适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像解释高度依赖操作者，且因解剖区域、采集协议和设备类型差异而显著变化，加上斑点噪声、低对比度和标准化标注有限等挑战，阻碍了泛化性强、标签高效的超声AI模型发展。

Method: 使用视觉Mamba骨干网络捕捉图像的局部和全局长程依赖；提出结合对比学习和掩码图像建模的自适应掩码框架，整合教师注意力图和学生重建损失来优化临床相关掩码；采用动态学习进度表调整预训练难度；在42个公共数据集的308K超声图像上预训练。

Result: 开发了迄今为止最大的公共超声数据集，构建了首个可复现的开源超声基础模型，可作为标签高效微调的主干网络适配各种下游任务。

Conclusion: OpenUS为超声AI提供了首个开源基础模型，通过创新的自适应掩码框架和动态学习策略，有效解决了超声图像分析中的泛化性和标签效率问题。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used medical imaging modalities, thanks to its low cost, portability, real-time feedback, and absence of ionizing radiation. However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/XZheng0427/OpenUS.

TL;DR: CVChess是一个深度学习框架，可将棋盘图像转换为FEN符号，然后输入在线象棋引擎提供最佳下一步棋


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疫情期间在线象棋观看人数激增，但实体象棋游戏缺乏数字辅助工具，造成模拟与数字象棋体验的鸿沟

Method: 使用带残差层的卷积神经网络进行棋子识别，包括霍夫线变换边缘检测、投影变换获得俯视视角、64个方格分割、13类棋子分类

Result: 在包含10,800张智能手机图像的Chess Recognition Dataset上训练和评估模型

Conclusion: 该系统能够将物理棋盘图像转换为FEN字符串，供象棋引擎生成最优走法

Abstract: Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move

*Benjamin Fein-Ashley,Jacob Fein-Ashley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种轻量级的跨模态融合模块，通过在编码器顶部添加少量双向交叉注意力层来对齐视觉和文本隐藏状态，既保持了编码器的理解能力，又实现了高效的跨模态对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型要么在编码器早期融合特征，要么在后期比较池化嵌入，但两种模态的隐藏状态已经包含了丰富的模态特定结构信息，直接对齐这些状态是更自然的方式。

Method: 在视觉和文本编码器顶部添加少量仅交叉的双向注意力层，将隐藏状态投影到共享空间进行跨模态注意力计算，并通过门控残差更新回传，使用简单稳定器改善对齐效果。

Result: 在标准检索、VQA和视觉推理基准测试中，BRIDGE优于可比较的视觉语言模型，同时保持了对比模型的双编码器效率。

Conclusion: BRIDGE提供了一种有效的方法来对齐视觉和语言表示，既保持了编码器的强理解能力，又实现了高效的跨模态融合，代码已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DocLens是一个工具增强的多智能体框架，通过"放大"证据来解决长视觉文档理解中的证据定位挑战，在MMLongBench-Doc和FinRAGBench-V上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视觉文档理解中存在证据定位的根本挑战，难以检索相关页面并忽略视觉元素中的细粒度细节，导致性能有限和模型幻觉。

Method: 提出DocLens框架，首先从完整文档导航到相关页面上的特定视觉元素，然后采用采样-裁决机制生成单一可靠答案。

Result: 与Gemini-2.5-Pro配对，DocLens在MMLongBench-Doc和FinRAGBench-V上实现最先进性能，甚至超越人类专家，特别是在视觉中心和不可回答查询上表现优异。

Conclusion: DocLens通过增强的定位能力证明了其在长视觉文档理解中的有效性，特别是在处理视觉中心和不可回答查询时显示出强大优势。

Abstract: Comprehending long visual documents, where information is distributed across extensive pages of text and visual elements, is a critical but challenging task for modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing approaches falter on a fundamental challenge: evidence localization. They struggle to retrieve relevant pages and overlook fine-grained details within visual elements, leading to limited performance and model hallucination. To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens. It first navigates from the full document to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate a single, reliable answer. Paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro, DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, surpassing even human experts. The framework's superiority is particularly evident on vision-centric and unanswerable queries, demonstrating the power of its enhanced localization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化方法需要密集多视角输入和昂贵的逐实例优化，限制了可扩展性；而现有feedforward方法产生粗糙几何、缺乏纹理重建且依赖复杂多阶段流程。

Method: 将LVSM扩展到关节设置，使用基于transformer的架构联合推理相机姿态和关节变化，生成深度图和部件掩码以促进显式3D网格提取和关节估计。

Result: 在多个物体类别上实现高保真重建，在新视角和状态合成以及3D关节物体重建方面优于最先进方法，生成与输入图像紧密贴合的高质量网格。

Conclusion: LARM提供了一个可扩展且准确的框架，能够从稀疏视图有效重建3D关节物体，消除了对密集监督的需求，并在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Modeling 3D articulated objects with realistic geometry, textures, and kinematics is essential for a wide range of applications. However, existing optimization-based reconstruction methods often require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, limiting their scalability. Recent feedforward approaches offer faster alternatives but frequently produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle, complex multi-stage pipelines. We introduce LARM, a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images by jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures. LARM extends LVSM a recent novel view synthesis (NVS) approach for static 3D objects into the articulated setting by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture, enabling scalable and accurate novel view synthesis. In addition, LARM generates auxiliary outputs such as depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation. Our pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse object categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to the input images. project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/

TL;DR: 该论文提出了AI伦理熵的第二定律，证明无约束AI会自发偏离目标，需要持续的对齐工作来维持稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决AI系统在无约束条件下会自发偏离预期目标的问题，需要建立定量框架来理解和管理AI对齐的稳定性。

Method: 定义了基于目标概率分布的伦理熵，证明了熵随时间增加，推导了对齐工作的临界稳定性边界，并通过模拟验证理论。

Result: 70亿参数模型从初始熵0.32漂移到1.69±1.08纳特，而使用对齐工作γ=20.4的系统保持稳定在0.00±0.00纳特。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI对齐重新定义为连续热力学控制问题，为维护先进自主系统的稳定性和安全性提供了定量基础。

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

TL;DR: Co-EPG是一个自迭代训练框架，通过规划和接地模型的协同进化，实现GUI任务自动化的持续改进，无需外部数据即可超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前GUI代理方法存在的两个基本限制：(1)跨模型协同利用不足，(2)过度依赖合成数据生成而利用不足。

Method: 提出Co-EPG框架，建立规划和接地模型之间的迭代正反馈循环：规划模型在接地奖励指导下通过GRPO探索策略，生成多样化数据优化接地模型；优化后的接地模型为后续规划模型训练提供更有效奖励。

Result: 在Multimodal-Mind2Web和AndroidControl基准测试中，仅经过三次迭代就超越了现有最先进方法，且每次迭代都持续改进。

Conclusion: 为GUI代理建立了新的训练范式，从孤立优化转向集成、自驱动的协同进化方法。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) task automation constitutes a critical frontier in artificial intelligence research. While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach.

Motivation: 现实决策问题通常涉及多个目标优化，决策者需要从帕累托最优解集中选择代表性子集，现有质量度量方法存在不直观行为，需要改进。

Method: 将帕累托剪枝重新定义为多赢家投票问题，进行公理化分析，提出新的定向覆盖度量方法，并分析各种质量度量的计算复杂性。

Conclusion: 质量度量的选择对所选解集特征有决定性影响，新提出的定向覆盖度量在多种场景下表现良好，为多目标决策提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

Motivation: 虽然现代SAT求解器在小树宽度的实例上表现高效，但对于更一般的图参数团宽度，编码能力的研究还很有限。抽象论证框架基于有向图且计算复杂，是研究计算特性的理想候选。

Method: 设计了从论证问题到(Q)SAT的新归约方法，这些归约能线性保持团宽度，称为有向分解引导(DDG)归约。

Result: 为所有论证语义（包括计数）建立了新结果，证明DDG归约引起的开销在合理假设下无法显著改进。

Conclusion: 本文开启了理解团宽度编码能力的研究，为抽象论证框架提供了高效的(Q)SAT编码方法，且这些方法在理论上是接近最优的。

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

Conclusion: PoR和PoB为反事实决策提供了新的有效工具，在真实世界数据集上展示了应用价值。

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

Result: 建立了统一的适应性推理分类体系，明确了不同机制在实践中的实现方式，为不同策略的系统比较提供了框架。

Conclusion: 适应性推理是LLM推理能力发展的关键方向，未来挑战包括自评估、元推理和人类对齐的推理控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

Abstract: Operational safety at mission-critical work sites is a top priority given the complex and hazardous nature of daily tasks. This paper presents the Human-Agent Risk Navigation and Event Safety System (HARNESS), a modular AI framework designed to forecast hazardous events and analyze operational risks in U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) environments. HARNESS integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured work data, historical event retrieval, and risk analysis to proactively identify potential hazards. A human-in-the-loop mechanism allows subject matter experts (SMEs) to refine predictions, creating an adaptive learning loop that enhances performance over time. By combining SME collaboration with iterative agentic reasoning, HARNESS improves the reliability and efficiency of predictive safety systems. Preliminary deployment shows promising results, with future work focusing on quantitative evaluation of accuracy, SME agreement, and decision latency reduction.

Conclusion: HyperComplEx框架能够有效处理知识图谱中多样化的关系类型，在保持高效训练的同时实现显著性能提升，并通过自适应维度分配实现良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

Result: 在39个复杂碰撞案例评估中，框架实现了100%准确率，成功识别最相关EDR事件并正确区分撞击与被撞车辆，即使在处理不完整数据时也保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了AI在处理异构碰撞数据方面的卓越能力，在重建碰撞动力学和表征事故前行为方面提供了前所未有的精度。

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

Abstract: Conventional planning units or urban regions, such as census tracts, zip codes, or neighborhoods, often do not capture the specific demands of local communities and lack the flexibility to implement effective strategies for hazard prevention or response. To support the creation of dynamic planning units, we introduce a planning support system with agentic AI that enables users to generate demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, integrating the human-in-the-loop principle for transparency and adaptability. The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.

Motivation: 当前方法过于简化脑连接性的复杂关系，假设单模态脑连接组作为疾病传播基质，导致病理传播预测不准确。纯数据驱动方法由于缺乏适当约束而面临可识别性问题。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解神经退行性疾病进展提供了更准确和可解释的方法，能够更好地捕捉脑区间的复杂相互作用。

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

Conclusion: 领域专业化和协调推理能够显著提升法律AI性能，为可信赖和可解释的自动化合规验证提供了可扩展且符合法规的框架。

Abstract: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is becoming increasingly critical under stringent privacy regulations such as the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). We propose a multi-agent legal verifier that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol. Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.

Conclusion: 自主AI系统需要超越训练策略，整合多种知识类型来构建和评估行动方案，以实现与人类价值观一致的目标。

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms generates vast amounts of unstructured product data, creating significant challenges for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and data analytics. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured, interpretable format to organize such data, yet constructing product-specific KGs remains a complex and manual process. This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable path toward intelligent product data integration and utilization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在约束编程中，抽象结构（如嵌套集合）需要转换为求解器支持的表示形式。对称性破坏技术通常通过变量排序来避免搜索对称解，但应用于抽象变量时会产生大量复杂约束，性能较差。

Method: 开发了一种新的不完全对称性破坏方法，通过更好地利用抽象结构的表示来处理对称性问题，特别针对不可区分对象产生的对称性。

Result: 该方法在破坏不可区分对象对称性方面比之前的方法（Akgün et al. 2025）更快。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法能够更有效地处理抽象结构的对称性问题，在性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

Motivation: 多智能体辩论在提升LLM推理能力方面具有潜力，但角色分配策略这一关键方面尚未充分探索，特别是在实际应用中真相未知的情况下。

Method: 提出"Truth Last"角色分配策略，并开发多智能体辩论一致性(MADC)策略，通过路径一致性评估独立角色间的一致性，将一致性最高的角色模拟为真相。

Result: 在9个LLM模型上的验证显示，MADC策略持续表现出先进性能，有效克服了MAD的性能瓶颈，在推理任务中性能提升显著。

Conclusion: MADC策略为LLM智能体扩展提供了关键改进路径，通过系统模拟和优化多智能体辩论的核心机制，显著提升了推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

Conclusion: DSS框架通过结合规划梯度和随机搜索，在自动驾驶规划任务中取得了显著优势。

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Abstract: We present ARCTraj, a dataset and methodological framework for modeling human reasoning through complex visual tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

### [137] [Multi-agent Undercover Gaming: Hallucination Removal via Counterfactual Test for Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11182)
*Dayong Liang,Xiao-Yong Wei,Changmeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MUG协议来解决LLM幻觉问题，通过多模态反事实测试检测"卧底"幻觉代理，提升多模态推理的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAD方法假设所有代理都是理性的，但实际代理本身可能产生幻觉，需要更可靠的检测机制

Method: 基于"谁是卧底"游戏设计MUG协议，通过修改参考图像引入反事实证据，观察代理是否能准确识别变化来检测幻觉代理

Result: MUG在三个关键维度上推进了MAD协议：事实验证、跨证据推理和主动推理

Conclusion: MUG为LLM多模态推理提供了更可靠有效的框架

Abstract: Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.

TL;DR: STaR框架为LLMs引入慢思考能力，通过两阶段难度感知强化学习和不确定性量化，提升表格推理的深度和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在表格推理中存在两个关键局限：推理过程缺乏人类认知的深度和迭代优化特性，以及推理过程不稳定影响下游应用可靠性。

Method: 采用两阶段难度感知强化学习（DRL），从简单到复杂查询逐步学习；推理时通过整合token级置信度和答案一致性进行轨迹级不确定性量化。

Result: 在基准测试中取得优越性能，推理稳定性显著增强，在领域外数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: STaR作为认知启发的可靠解决方案，为LLMs表格推理提供了有效的慢思考能力，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for mission planning, perception, and decision-making, yet the lack of standardized and physically grounded benchmarks limits systematic evaluation of their reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce UAVBench, an open benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 validated UAV flight scenarios generated through taxonomy-guided LLM prompting and multi-stage safety validation. Each scenario is encoded in a structured JSON schema that includes mission objectives, vehicle configuration, environmental conditions, and quantitative risk labels, providing a unified representation of UAV operations across diverse domains. Building on this foundation, we present UAVBench_MCQ, a reasoning-oriented extension containing 50,000 multiple-choice questions spanning ten cognitive and ethical reasoning styles, ranging from aerodynamics and navigation to multi-agent coordination and integrated reasoning. This framework enables interpretable and machine-checkable assessment of UAV-specific cognition under realistic operational contexts. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-5, ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3, Qwen3 235B, and ERNIE 4.5 300B, and find strong performance in perception and policy reasoning but persistent challenges in ethics-aware and resource-constrained decision-making. UAVBench establishes a reproducible and physically grounded foundation for benchmarking agentic AI in autonomous aerial systems and advancing next-generation UAV reasoning intelligence. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the UAVBench dataset, the UAVBench_MCQ benchmark, evaluation scripts, and all related materials on GitHub at https://github.com/maferrag/UAVBench

Abstract: The discovery of novel Ionic Liquids (ILs) is hindered by critical challenges in property prediction, including limited data, poor model accuracy, and fragmented workflows. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery.

Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

Conclusion: 该方法为解决AI决策责任问题提供了实用且有效的解决方案，确保决策过程的可追溯性和法律合规性。

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出对比ABox解释的概念，用于回答"为什么a是C的实例而b不是？"这类问题，同时考虑正蕴含和缺失蕴含，关注a和b之间的相关共性和差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别解释正蕴含（为什么C(a)被知识库蕴含）和缺失蕴含（为什么C(b)不被蕴含），但缺乏同时考虑两者的对比解释方法，无法有效揭示实例间的相关差异。

Method: 为描述逻辑本体论的ABox推理开发了对比解释的适当概念，分析了不同变体在不同最优性标准下的计算复杂度，涵盖轻量级和更表达性的描述逻辑。

Result: 实现了计算对比解释变体的首个方法，并在现实知识库的生成问题上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 对比ABox解释能够有效回答实例分类差异的原因，通过同时考虑正负蕴含来聚焦相关共性和差异，为描述逻辑推理提供了新的解释能力。

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcoAlign是一个推理时框架，将大视觉语言模型对齐重新定义为经济理性的搜索问题，通过前瞻性函数动态权衡安全性、实用性和成本，在更低计算成本下实现更好的安全性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的对齐方法在安全性、实用性和运营成本之间存在权衡困难，仅关注最终输出的方法会浪费大量计算预算在不安全的推理上，有害推理可能通过良性理由伪装来规避简单的安全评分。

Method: 将LVLM视为有限理性代理，增量扩展思维图，使用前瞻性函数（类似净现值）对行动评分，动态权衡预期安全性、实用性和成本与剩余预算，并通过最弱链接原则强制执行路径安全性。

Result: 在3个闭源和2个开源模型上的6个数据集实验表明，EcoAlign在更低计算成本下匹配或超越了最先进的安全性和实用性。

Conclusion: EcoAlign为强大的LVLM对齐提供了原则性、经济性的路径，解决了安全与效率的平衡问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在社交导航中的局限性：基于规则的方法缺乏泛化性，而数据驱动方法效率低、不透明且难以与人类直觉对齐。

Method: 提出RLSLM混合框架，将基于实证行为实验的社会运动模型集成到强化学习的奖励函数中，生成方向敏感的社会舒适度场，联合优化机械能量和社会舒适度。

Result: 在沉浸式VR实验中，RLSLM在用户体验上优于最先进的基于规则模型，消融和敏感性分析显示其比传统数据驱动方法具有显著改进的可解释性。

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了一个可扩展的、以人为中心的方法论，有效整合认知科学和机器学习，用于现实世界的社会导航。

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

Abstract: We introduce KarmaTS, an interactive framework for constructing lag-indexed, executable spatiotemporal causal graphical models for multivariate time series (MTS) simulation. Motivated by the challenge of access-restricted physiological data, KarmaTS generates synthetic MTS with known causal dynamics and augments real-world datasets with expert knowledge. The system constructs a discrete-time structural causal process (DSCP) by combining expert knowledge and algorithmic proposals in a mixed-initiative, human-in-the-loop workflow. The resulting DSCP supports simulation and causal interventions, including those under user-specified distribution shifts. KarmaTS handles mixed variable types, contemporaneous and lagged edges, and modular edge functionals ranging from parameterizable templates to neural network models. Together, these features enable flexible validation and benchmarking of causal discovery algorithms through expert-informed simulation.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型的输出长度限制了单次推理的深度，而多代理推理系统虽然有效但难以推广到开源模型，因为开源模型缺乏足够的批评和修正能力。

Method: 提出MarsRL框架，采用代理特定的奖励机制来减少奖励噪声，并使用管道式训练来高效处理长轨迹，联合优化系统中的所有代理。

Result: 在Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507上应用MarsRL，将AIME2025准确率从86.5%提升到93.3%，BeyondAIME从64.9%提升到73.8%，甚至超过了Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507。

Conclusion: MarsRL有潜力推进多代理推理系统的发展，并扩大其在各种推理任务中的适用性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has been propelled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and test-time scaling. However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. These findings highlight the potential of MarsRL to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数预测模型未能充分利用EHR中多模态数据之间的交互、冗余和时间模式，通常只关注单一数据类型或忽略这些复杂性，而医生需要综合多模态和时间序列数据来形成对患者健康的全面视图。

Method: 使用大语言模型处理临床文本和文本实验室测试，使用transformer编码器处理纵向序列就诊数据，整合非结构化临床笔记、实验室测试和患者时间序列数据。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和FEMH数据集上，CURENet在多标签框架中预测前10种慢性疾病时达到94%以上的准确率。

Conclusion: 多模态EHR整合有潜力增强临床决策制定并改善患者预后。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统在训练后难以自适应调整问题解决方法，要么只能修改文本输入，要么需要离线优化且部署后无法改变。需要一种能在推理时灵活调整所有策略组件的系统。

Method: 使用基于LLM的元策略来生成策略，包含两个组件：Guide基于当前问题和过往经验生成候选策略，Consolidator整合执行反馈来改进未来策略生成。

Result: 在五个挑战性基准测试中，EGuR相比最强基线实现了高达14%的准确率提升，同时计算成本降低了111倍，且随着经验积累性能持续提升。

Conclusion: EGuR证明了在推理时动态生成完整计算策略的可行性，实现了AI系统的真正自适应，在提升性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模型引导策略塑造的测试时对齐技术，能够在复杂动态环境中精确控制个体行为属性，实现伦理对齐与奖励最大化之间的权衡，无需重新训练智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂动态环境中部署决策AI智能体时，保持与人类价值观或指导方针的对齐是一个关键挑战。仅训练实现目标的智能体可能采取有害行为，暴露出最大化奖励函数与保持对齐之间的权衡问题。

Method: 使用模型引导策略塑造的测试时对齐技术。首先训练RL智能体在各自游戏中最大化奖励，然后在测试时通过场景-动作属性分类器应用策略塑造，确保决策与伦理属性对齐。

Result: 在包含134个基于文本游戏环境和数千个伦理决策标注场景的MACHIAVELLI基准测试中，测试时策略塑造提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案，能够减轻不同环境和对齐属性中的不道德行为。

Conclusion: 测试时策略塑造为缓解不同环境和对齐属性中的不道德行为提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案，无需智能体重新训练即可实现伦理对齐与奖励最大化之间的原则性权衡。

Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.
