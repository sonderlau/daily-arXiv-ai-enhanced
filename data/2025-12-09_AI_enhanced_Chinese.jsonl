We here use a multi-model framework to investigate how the tropical troposphere responds to SAI when sea surface temperatures are held fixed. By performing convection-resolving simulations in small-domains and in mock-Walker setups, and contrasting these with global climate model simulations, we trace how stratospheric aerosols radiatively heat the troposphere, and in turn alter convection, clouds, and rainfall. Our simulations show an SAI-induced reduction in tropical mean precipitation, yet decreased cloud radiative heating moderates this effect and complicates its predictability. Regional rainfall anomalies within the tropics can be substantial. However, surface-temperature-independent effects on tropical circulation are found to be negligible, indicating that stratospheric aerosols do not inherently alter the tropical overturning circulation as previously suggested. These results clarify the mechanisms governing SAI hydroclimate impacts and show that key uncertainties arise from cloud processes that models are unable to constrain. Consequently, near-term SAI deployment would carry the risk of being implemented without the ability to reliably predict its hydroclimate impacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5e73\u6d41\u5c42\u6c14\u6eb6\u80f6\u6ce8\u5165\uff08SAI\uff09\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u70ed\u5e26\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u6c34\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u70ed\u5e26\u73af\u6d41\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u4e91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f7f\u6c34\u6587\u6c14\u5019\u5f71\u54cd\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76SAI\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5730\u8868\u51b7\u5374\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6539\u53d8\u964d\u96e8\u548c\u98ce\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5e73\u6d41\u5c42\u6c14\u6eb6\u80f6\u5bf9\u70ed\u5e26\u5bf9\u6d41\u5c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c0f\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u6d41\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u6c83\u514b\u73af\u6d41\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u5168\u7403\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6d77\u9762\u6e29\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5206\u6790SAI\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "SAI\u5bfc\u81f4\u70ed\u5e26\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u6c34\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u4e91\u8f90\u5c04\u52a0\u70ed\u51cf\u5f31\u7f13\u548c\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u533a\u57df\u964d\u96e8\u5f02\u5e38\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u5bf9\u70ed\u5e26\u73af\u6d41\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1", "conclusion": "SAI\u4e0d\u4f1a\u56fa\u6709\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u70ed\u5e26\u73af\u6d41\uff0c\u4f46\u4e91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f7f\u6c34\u6587\u6c14\u5019\u5f71\u54cd\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd1\u671f\u90e8\u7f72SAI\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669"}}

Recent studies have identified cold pools and planetary rotation as factors that increase and decrease TC embryo size. While the planetary rotation effect has been depicted using a quasi-geostrophic (QG) model, the cold pool effect still lacks a theoretical model. This paper presents a cloud chain model to derive the length scale regarding the influence of cold pools on the TC embryo vortex. Within the model, the amount of rain evaporation during a single convective event determines the wind speed and humidity at the cold pool edge, influencing the amount of sub-cloud moisture convergence for the next-generation convection and, therefore, the intensity of the next-generation cold pool. A perturbation analysis shows that cold pools exhibit a nonlocal dependence on air-column humidity, with the influence range determined by the cold pool size and a convective memory weight. The memory weight relies on the sum of the contributions of mechanical lifting and thermodynamic forcing to convective initiation. A crucial parameter is the ratio of rain evaporation to surface evaporation in a cold pool. By coupling the cloud chain model with the QG equation, an analytical expression for the TC embryo size is obtained. The theory captures the trend but overestimates the TC embryo size in cloud-permitting simulations. The deviation might be due to the oversimplification in estimating the fractional contribution of cold pools to convective initiation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e91\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u51b7\u6c60\u5bf9\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u65cb\u80da\u80ce\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51c6\u5730\u8f6c\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f97\u5230TC\u80da\u80ce\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u7406\u8bba\u503c\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u4e91\u5206\u8fa8\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u65cb\u80da\u80ce\u5c3a\u5ea6\u662fTC\u751f\u6210\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u51b7\u6c60\u548c\u884c\u661f\u65cb\u8f6c\u5206\u522b\u4f1a\u589e\u5927\u548c\u51cf\u5c0fTC\u80da\u80ce\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u884c\u661f\u65cb\u8f6c\u6548\u5e94\u5df2\u6709\u51c6\u5730\u8f6c\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u51b7\u6c60\u6548\u5e94\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e91\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u51b7\u6c60\u5bf9TC\u80da\u80ce\u6da1\u65cb\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8003\u8651\u5355\u6b21\u5bf9\u6d41\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u96e8\u6ef4\u84b8\u53d1\u91cf\u51b3\u5b9a\u51b7\u6c60\u8fb9\u7f18\u98ce\u901f\u548c\u6e7f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u6b21\u4e91\u5c42\u6c34\u6c7d\u8f90\u5408\u548c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u51b7\u6c60\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u51b7\u6c60\u5bf9\u7a7a\u6c14\u67f1\u6e7f\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5c40\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8303\u56f4\u7531\u51b7\u6c60\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5bf9\u6d41\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6743\u91cd\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u5c06\u4e91\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u51c6\u5730\u8f6c\u65b9\u7a0b\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5f97\u5230TC\u80da\u80ce\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e91\u5206\u8fa8\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86TC\u80da\u80ce\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u51b7\u6c60\u5bf9\u6d41\u542f\u52a8\u8d21\u732e\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u51b7\u6c60\u5f71\u54cdTC\u80da\u80ce\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3TC\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9645\u80da\u80ce\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This paper uses the term \"Gentelligent system\" to refer to systems that incorporate inherent component information (akin to genes in bioinformatics-where manufacturing operations are likened to chromosomes in this study) and automated mechanisms. By implementing reliable fault detection methods, manufacturers can achieve several benefits, including improved product quality, increased yield, and reduced production costs. To support these objectives, we propose a hybrid framework with a dominance-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. This mechanism enables simultaneous optimization of feature selection and classification performance by exploring Pareto-optimal solutions in a single run. This solution helps monitor various manufacturing operations, addressing a range of conflicting objectives that need to be minimized together.

Data, prompts, and code available at https://osf.io/dc24t/", "summary": "Large language models are increasingly used to evaluate other models, yet these judgments typically lack any representation of confidence. This pilot study tests whether framing an evaluation task as a betting game (a fictional prediction market with its own LLM currency) improves forecasting accuracy and surfaces calibrated confidence signals. We generated 100 math and logic questions with verifiable answers. Six Baseline models (three current-generation, three prior-generation) answered all items. Three Predictor models then forecasted, for each question-baseline pair, if the baseline would answer correctly. Each predictor completed matched runs in two conditions: Control (simple correct/incorrect predictions) and Incentive (predictions plus wagers of 1-100,000 LLMCoin under even odds, starting from a 1,000,000 LLMCoin bankroll). Across 5,400 predictions per condition, Incentive runs showed modestly higher accuracy (81.5% vs. 79.1%, p = .089, d = 0.86) and significantly faster learning across rounds (12.0 vs. 2.9 percentage-point improvement from Round 1 to Round 4, p = .011). Most notably, stake size tracked confidence. \"Whale\" bets of 40,000+ coins were correct ~99% of the time, while small bets (<1,000 coins) showed only ~74% accuracy. The key finding is not that fictional money makes models smarter; accuracy gains were modest and did not reach statistical significance (p = .089) in this pilot. Rather, the betting mechanic created a legible confidence signal absent from binary yes/no outputs. This suggests that simple financial framing may help transform LLMs into risk-aware forecasters, making their internal beliefs visible and usable. The protocol offers a foundation for future work for meta-evaluation systems and what may become LLM-to-LLM prediction markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u865a\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u6ce8\u6e38\u620f\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u8bfb\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9LLM\u8868\u8fbe\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u5ff5\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u610f\u8bc6", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1100\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba96\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u7b54\uff0c3\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u7b54\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff1a\u63a7\u5236\u7ec4\uff08\u7b80\u5355\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u7ec4\uff08\u9884\u6d4b+1-100,000 LLMCoin\u6295\u6ce8\uff09", "result": "\u6fc0\u52b1\u7ec4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7565\u9ad8\uff0881.5% vs 79.1%\uff09\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5feb\uff08\u7b2c1\u8f6e\u5230\u7b2c4\u8f6e\u63d0\u534712.0% vs 2.9%\uff09\uff0c\u6295\u6ce8\u91d1\u989d\u4e0e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff1a\u5927\u989d\u6295\u6ce8\uff0840,000+\uff09\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u7ea699%\uff0c\u5c0f\u989d\u6295\u6ce8\uff08<1,000\uff09\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u7ea674%", "conclusion": "\u6295\u6ce8\u673a\u5236\u4e3aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u8bfb\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f7f\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u5ff5\u53ef\u89c1\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u5143\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840"}}

In this algorithm, the hunting process consists of four steps: driving, blocking, chasing, and attacking. Because of the novelty of ChOA, the steps of the hunting process have been modeled in a simple way, leading to slow and premature convergence similar to other iterative algorithms. This paper proposes six spiral functions and introduces two novel hybrid spiral functions (SEB-ChOA) to address these deficiencies. The performance of SEB-ChOA is evaluated on 23 standard benchmarks, 20 benchmarks of the IEEE CEC-2005 test suite, 10 cases from the IEEE CEC06-2019 test suite, and 12 constrained real-world engineering problems from IEEE CEC-2020. The SEB-ChOA variants are compared with three groups of optimization algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) as well-known optimizers; Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA), Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA), Ant Lion Optimization (ALO), and Henry Gas Solubility Optimization (HGSO) as recently developed optimizers; and jDE100 and DISHchain1e+12, the winners of the IEEE CEC06-2019 competition. Additional comparisons are made with EBOwithCMAR and CIPDE as strong secondary baselines. The SEB-ChOA methods achieve top-ranked results on nearly all benchmarks and show competitive performance compared to jDE100 and DISHchain1e+12.

Unlike traditional dataset pruning and distillation methods that focus on inter-sample redundancy, the proposed method compresses each image by reducing redundant or less informative content within samples while preserving essential features. It first applies linear symmetric quantization to obtain an initial quantization range and scale for each sample. Then, an adaptive quantization allocation algorithm is introduced to distribute different quantization ratios for samples with varying precision requirements, maintaining a constant total compression ratio. The main contributions include: (1) being the first to use limited bits to represent datasets for storage reduction; (2) introducing a dataset-level quantization algorithm with adaptive ratio allocation; and (3) validating the method's effectiveness through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K.

Machine learning (ML) has shown promise in automating ASD diagnosis, but most existing models operate as black boxes and are typically trained on a single dataset, limiting their generalizability. In this study, we introduce a transparent and interpretable ML approach that leverages BioBERT, a state-of-the-art language model, to analyze unstructured clinical text. The model is trained to label descriptions of behaviors and map them to diagnostic criteria, which are then used to assign a final label (ASD or not). We evaluate transfer learning, the ability to transfer knowledge to new data, using two distinct real-world datasets. We trained on datasets sequentially and mixed together and compared the performance of the best models and their ability to transfer to new data. We also created a black-box approach and repeated this transfer process for comparison. Our transparent model demonstrated robust performance, with the mixed-data training strategy yielding the best results (97 % sensitivity, 98 % specificity). Sequential training across datasets led to a slight drop in performance, highlighting the importance of training data order. The black-box model performed worse (90 % sensitivity, 96 % specificity) when trained sequentially or with mixed data. Overall, our transparent approach outperformed the black-box approach. Mixing datasets during training resulted in slightly better performance and should be the preferred approach when practically possible.

Existing methods often struggle with multi-view fusion, leading to fragmented 3D representations and sub-optimal performance. To address this, we introduce VG3T, a novel multi-view feed-forward network that predicts a 3D semantic occupancy via a 3D Gaussian representation. Unlike prior methods that infer Gaussians from single-view images, our model directly predicts a set of semantically attributed Gaussians in a joint, multi-view fashion. This novel approach overcomes the fragmentation and inconsistency inherent in view-by-view processing, offering a unified paradigm to represent both geometry and semantics. We also introduce two key components, Grid-Based Sampling and Positional Refinement, to mitigate the distance-dependent density bias common in pixel-aligned Gaussian initialization methods.

Albrecht"], "title": "ARCANE: A Multi-Agent Framework for Interpretable and Configurable Alignment", "comment": "Accepted to the AAAI 2026 LLAMAS Workshop (Large Language Model Agents for Multi-Agent Systems)", "summary": "As agents based on large language models are increasingly deployed to long-horizon tasks, maintaining their alignment with stakeholder preferences becomes critical. Effective alignment in such settings requires reward models that are interpretable so that stakeholders can understand and audit model objectives. Moreover, reward models must be capable of steering agents at interaction time, allowing preference shifts to be incorporated without retraining. We introduce ARCANE, a framework that frames alignment as a multi-agent collaboration problem that dynamically represents stakeholder preferences as natural-language rubrics: weighted sets of verifiable criteria that can be generated on-the-fly from task context. Inspired by utility theory, we formulate rubric learning as a reconstruction problem and apply a regularized Group-Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) procedure that balances interpretability, faithfulness, and computational efficiency. Using a corpus of 219 labeled rubrics derived from the GDPVal benchmark, we evaluate ARCANE on challenging tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and tool use. The learned rubrics produce compact, legible evaluations and enable configurable trade-offs (e.g., correctness vs. conciseness) without retraining. Our results show that rubric-based reward models offer a promising path toward interpretable, test-time adaptive alignment for complex, long-horizon AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARCANE\u6846\u67b6\u5c06AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u4ee3\u8868\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u957f\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba9\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5ba1\u6838\u6a21\u578b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u7eb3\u5165\u504f\u597d\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faARCANE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5c06\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u504f\u597d\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u52a0\u6743\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6807\u51c6\uff09\u3002\u53d7\u6548\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u91cd\u6784\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u7ec4\u5e8f\u5217\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316(GSPO)\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4eceGDPVal\u57fa\u51c6\u6d3e\u751f\u7684219\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30ARCANE\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u4ea7\u751f\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u6613\u8bfb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff08\u5982\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\uff09\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u3001\u957f\u671fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Each vesicle is a self contained object v = (c, kappa, l, tau, s) carrying a vector payload, type label, location on the graph G = (V, E), remaining lifetime, and optional internal state. Vesicles are emitted in response to activity, errors, or meta signals; migrate along learned transition kernels; probabilistically dock at nodes; locally modify activations, parameters, learning rules, or external memory through content dependent release operators; and finally decay or are absorbed.\n  This event based interaction layer reshapes neuromodulation. Instead of applying the same conditioning tensors on every forward pass, modulation emerges from the stochastic evolution of a vesicle population that can accumulate, disperse, trigger cascades, carve transient pathways, and write structured traces into topological memory. Dense, short lived vesicles approximate familiar tensor mechanisms such as FiLM, hypernetworks, or attention. Sparse, long lived vesicles resemble a small set of mobile agents that intervene only at rare but decisive moments.\n  We give a complete mathematical specification of the framework, including emission, migration, docking, release, decay, and their coupling to learning; a continuous density relaxation that yields differentiable reaction diffusion dynamics on the graph; and a reinforcement learning view where vesicle control is treated as a policy optimized for downstream performance. We also outline how the same formalism extends to spiking networks and neuromorphic hardware such as the Darwin3 chip, enabling programmable neuromodulation on large scale brain inspired computers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Neuro-Vesicles\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u56ca\u6ce1\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u56ca\u6ce1\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5916\u90e8\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u8282\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c42\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u79ef\u7d2f\u3001\u5206\u6563\u3001\u7ea7\u8054\u89e6\u53d1\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56ca\u6ce1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56ca\u6ce1\u5305\u542b\u5411\u91cf\u8f7d\u8377\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u56fe\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u56ca\u6ce1\u54cd\u5e94\u6d3b\u52a8\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u5143\u4fe1\u53f7\u800c\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u6cbf\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6838\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u6982\u7387\u6027\u5730\u505c\u9760\u5728\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u91ca\u653e\u64cd\u4f5c\u5668\u4fee\u6539\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8870\u51cf\u6216\u88ab\u5438\u6536\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53d1\u5c04\u3001\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u505c\u9760\u3001\u91ca\u653e\u3001\u8870\u51cf\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff1b\u8fde\u7eed\u5bc6\u5ea6\u677e\u5f1b\u4ea7\u751f\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u53cd\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\u5c06\u56ca\u6ce1\u63a7\u5236\u89c6\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u5bc6\u96c6\u77ed\u5bff\u547d\u56ca\u6ce1\u8fd1\u4f3cFiLM\u3001\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5230\u7a00\u758f\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u56ca\u6ce1\u7c7b\u4f3c\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u8be5\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8109\u51b2\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7c7b\u8111\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u8282\u3002"}}

We recast grounding from a binary judgment into an audit across desiderata, each indexed by an evaluation tuple (context, meaning type, threat model, reference distribution): authenticity (mechanisms reside inside the agent and, for strong claims, were acquired through learning or evolution); preservation (atomic meanings remain intact); faithfulness, both correlational (realized meanings match intended ones) and etiological (internal mechanisms causally contribute to success); robustness (graceful degradation under declared perturbations); compositionality (the whole is built systematically from the parts). We apply this framework to four grounding modes (symbolic; referential; vectorial; relational) and three case studies: model-theoretic semantics achieves exact composition but lacks etiological warrant; large language models show correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks, yet lack selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction; human language meets the desiderata under strong authenticity through evolutionary and developmental acquisition. By operationalizing a philosophical inquiry about representation, we equip philosophers of science, computer scientists, linguists, and mathematicians with a common language and technical framework for systematic investigation of grounding and meaning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u7b26\u53f7\u63a5\u5730\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u3001\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56db\u79cd\u63a5\u5730\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u54f2\u5b66\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u63a5\u5730\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7b26\u53f7\u63a5\u5730\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u5373\u7b26\u53f7\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u4f53\u5efa\u7acb\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5f62\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u5143\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b26\u53f7\u63a5\u5730\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u63a5\u5730\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u6c42\uff1a\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff08\u673a\u5236\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5185\u90e8\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60/\u8fdb\u5316\u83b7\u5f97\uff09\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\uff08\u539f\u5b50\u610f\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u6574\uff09\u3001\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff08\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u6027\uff09\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u5728\u58f0\u660e\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u96c5\u964d\u7ea7\uff09\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\uff08\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u4ece\u90e8\u5206\u6784\u5efa\u6574\u4f53\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u5143\u7ec4\uff08\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u610f\u4e49\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u6765\u7d22\u5f15\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56db\u79cd\u63a5\u5730\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u7b26\u53f7\u3001\u6307\u79f0\u3001\u5411\u91cf\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u8bba\u8bed\u4e49\u5b66\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7ec4\u5408\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u5173\u62df\u5408\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65e0\u63a5\u5730\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6210\u529f\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5316\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u83b7\u5f97\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u54f2\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u95ee\u9898\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u54f2\u5b66\u5bb6\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5bb6\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u63a5\u5730\u548c\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8c03\u67e5\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This difficulty stems primarily from the high memory demands of maintaining accurate spike-timing logs and the potential for purely local plasticity adjustments to clash with the supervised learning goal. To effectively leverage local signals derived from spiking neuron dynamics, we introduce Dopamine-Modulated Spike-Synchrony-Dependent Plasticity (DA-SSDP), a synchrony-based rule that is sensitive to loss and brings a synchrony-based local learning signal to the model. DA-SSDP condenses spike patterns into a synchrony metric at the batch level. An initial brief warm-up phase assesses its relationship to the task loss and sets a fixed gate that subsequently adjusts the local update's magnitude. In cases where synchrony proves unrelated to the task, the gate settles at one, simplifying DA-SSDP to a basic two-factor synchrony mechanism that delivers minor weight adjustments driven by concurrent spike firing and a Gaussian latency function. These small weight updates are only added to the network`s deeper layers following the backpropagation phase, and our tests showed this simplified version did not degrade performance and sometimes gave a small accuracy boost, serving as a regularizer during training. The rule stores only binary spike indicators and first-spike latencies with a Gaussian kernel. Without altering the model structure or optimization routine, evaluations on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (+0.42\\%), CIFAR-100 (+0.99\\%), CIFAR10-DVS (+0.1\\%), and ImageNet-1K (+0.73\\%) demonstrated consistent accuracy gains, accompanied by a minor increase in computational overhead.

However, existing models are predominantly trained on surgical pathology data, which is enriched for non-nervous tissue and overrepresents neoplastic, inflammatory, metabolic, and other non-neurological diseases. Neuropathology represents a markedly different domain of histopathology, characterized by unique cell types (neurons, glia, etc.), distinct cytoarchitecture, and disease-specific pathological features including neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, Lewy bodies, and pattern-specific neurodegeneration. This domain mismatch may limit the ability of general-purpose foundation models to capture the morphological patterns critical for interpreting neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebellar ataxias. To address this gap, we developed NeuroFM, a foundation model trained specifically on whole-slide images of brain tissue spanning diverse neurodegenerative pathologies. NeuroFM demonstrates superior performance compared to general-purpose models across multiple neuropathology-specific downstream tasks, including mixed dementia disease classification, hippocampal region segmentation, and neurodegenerative ataxia identification encompassing cerebellar essential tremor and spinocerebellar ataxia subtypes. This work establishes that domain-specialized foundation models trained on brain tissue can better capture neuropathology-specific features than models trained on general surgical pathology datasets. By tailoring foundation models to the unique morphological landscape of neurodegenerative diseases, NeuroFM enables more accurate and reliable AI-based analysis for brain disease diagnosis and research, setting a precedent for domain-specific model development in specialized areas of digital pathology.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroFM\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u6a21\u578b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u79d1\u75c5\u7406\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7279\u6709\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1NeuroFM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8111\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316", "result": "NeuroFM\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6027\u75f4\u5446\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6d77\u9a6c\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u5171\u6d4e\u5931\u8c03\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u8111\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5176\u4ed6\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u6811\u7acb\u4e86\u5148\u4f8b"}}

It further highlights future research directions including federated learning for privacy-preserving collaboration, fairness-aware and interpretable AI, reinforcement learning for adaptive defenses, and human-in-the-loop visualization systems to ensure that next-generation AML architectures remain transparent, accountable, and robust.

Experimental results show that the RAG-Graph architecture delivers high faithfulness and strong answer relevancy across diverse evaluation settings, thereby enhancing the efficiency and transparency of KYC CDD/EDD workflows and contributing to more sustainable, resource-optimized compliance practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86AI\u5728\u53cd\u6d17\u94b1(AML)\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG Graph)\u7684KYC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3aKYC\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d17\u94b1\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6bcf\u5e74\u9020\u6210\u6570\u4e07\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u5168\u7403\u91d1\u878d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u4f20\u7edfAML\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f4e\u3001\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u67e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u91cd\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981AI\u6280\u672f\u6765\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316AML\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "method": "1. \u7efc\u8ff0AI\u5728AML\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u73b0\u72b6\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff1a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b3. \u8bbe\u8ba1AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684KYC\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG Graph)\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347KYC\u6d41\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cRAG-Graph\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u7b54\u6848\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86KYC\u5ba2\u6237\u5c3d\u804c\u8c03\u67e5(CDD)\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u5c3d\u804c\u8c03\u67e5(EDD)\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316AML\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684RAG-Graph KYC\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI\u5728\u589e\u5f3aKYC\u6d41\u7a0b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u95ee\u8d23\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684AML\u67b6\u6784\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However building these networks in hardware respecting both tight energy and memory budgets, remains a core challenge in the field. We address this challenge through novel algorithm-hardware co-design effort. At the algorithm level, inspired by the cortical fast-slow organization in the brain, we introduce a neural network with an explicit slow memory pathway that, combined with fast spiking activity, enables a dual memory pathway (DMP) architecture in which each layer maintains a compact low-dimensional state that summarizes recent activity and modulates spiking dynamics. This explicit memory stabilizes learning while preserving event-driven sparsity, achieving competitive accuracy on long-sequence benchmarks with 40-60% fewer parameters than equivalent state-of-the-art spiking neural networks. At the hardware level, we introduce a near-memory-compute architecture that fully leverages the advantages of the DMP architecture by retaining its compact shared state while optimizing dataflow, across heterogeneous sparse-spike and dense-memory pathways. We show experimental results that demonstrate more than a 4x increase in throughput and over a 5x improvement in energy efficiency compared with state-of-the-art implementations. Together, these contributions demonstrate that biological principles can guide functional abstractions that are both algorithmically effective and hardware-efficient, establishing a scalable co-design paradigm for real-time neuromorphic computation and learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u5927\u8111\u76ae\u5c42\u5feb\u6162\u7ec4\u7ec7\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u53cc\u8bb0\u5fc6\u901a\u8def\uff08DMP\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5-\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1140-60%\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53474\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u53475\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\uff1a\u53d7\u5927\u8111\u76ae\u5c42\u5feb\u6162\u7ec4\u7ec7\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u6162\u8bb0\u5fc6\u901a\u8def\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53cc\u8bb0\u5fc6\u901a\u8def\uff08DMP\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6bcf\u5c42\u7ef4\u62a4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u603b\u7ed3\u8fd1\u671f\u6d3b\u52a8\u5e76\u8c03\u8282\u8109\u51b2\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u786c\u4ef6\u5c42\u9762\uff1a\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd1\u5185\u5b58\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528DMP\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u7a00\u758f\u8109\u51b2\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u901a\u8def\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u51cf\u5c1140-60%\u3002\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c55\u793a\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53474\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u53475\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u7269\u539f\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u65e2\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u53c8\u786c\u4ef6\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We introduce FishDetector-R1, a unified MLLM-based framework for fish detection, segmentation, and counting under weak supervision. On the DeepFish dataset, our framework achieves substantial gains over baselines, improving AP by 20% and mIoU by 10%, while reducing MAE by 30% and GAME by 35%. These improvements stem from two key components: a novel detect-to-count prompt that enforces spatially consistent detections and counts, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) with a complementary scalable paradigm leveraging sparse point labels. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of this reward design. Moreover, the improvement generalizes well to other underwater datasets, confirming strong cross-domain robustness.

Dual Evaluation Perspectives on Knowledge Graph Completion", "comment": "5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, ACM WSDM 2026", "summary": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing facts from the observed KG. While a number of KGC models have been studied, the evaluation of KGC still remain underexplored. In this paper, we observe that existing metrics overlook two key perspectives for KGC evaluation: (A1) predictive sharpness -- the degree of strictness in evaluating an individual prediction, and (A2) popularity-bias robustness -- the ability to predict low-popularity entities. Toward reflecting both perspectives, we propose a novel evaluation framework (PROBE), which consists of a rank transformer (RT) estimating the score of each prediction based on a required level of predictive sharpness and a rank aggregator (RA) aggregating all the scores in a popularity-aware manner. Experiments on real-world KGs reveal that existing metrics tend to over- or under-estimate the accuracy of KGC models, whereas PROBE yields a comprehensive understanding of KGC models and reliable evaluation results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPROBE\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79e9\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u548c\u79e9\u805a\u5408\u5668\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8865\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5ffd\u89c6\u9884\u6d4b\u9510\u5ea6\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8865\u5168(KGC)\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u5ffd\u89c6\u9884\u6d4b\u9510\u5ea6\uff08\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\uff1b2) \u5ffd\u89c6\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff09", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPROBE\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u79e9\u8f6c\u6362\u5668(RT)\u548c\u79e9\u805a\u5408\u5668(RA)\u3002RT\u6839\u636e\u6240\u9700\u9884\u6d4b\u9510\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5206\u6570\uff0cRA\u4ee5\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\u6240\u6709\u5206\u6570", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4f30\u6216\u4f4e\u4f30KGC\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800cPROBE\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9KGC\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c", "conclusion": "PROBE\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8865\u5168\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u9510\u5ea6\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3"}}

Better robustness to affine transformation and overlapping image detection are some of the benefits associated with CapsNets.

In addition, CapsNets' training and testing are slow and resource hungry. This paper investigates the possibility of Primary Capsules pruning in CapsNets on MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets. We show that a pruned version of CapsNet performs up to 9.90 times faster than the conventional architecture by removing 95 percent of Capsules without a loss of accuracy. Also, our pruned architecture saves on more than 95.36 percent of floating-point operations in the dynamic routing stage of the architecture.

While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for eliciting such post-training reasoning capabilities due to its exceptional performance, it remains plagued by significant training instability and poor sample efficiency. We theoretically identify the root cause of these issues as the lack of distinctiveness within on-policy rollouts: for routine queries, highly homogeneous samples induce destructive gradient conflicts; whereas for hard queries, the scarcity of valid positive samples results in ineffective optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose Distinctiveness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (DaGRPO). DaGRPO incorporates two core mechanisms: (1) Sequence-level Gradient Rectification, which utilizes fine-grained scoring to dynamically mask sample pairs with low distinctiveness, thereby eradicating gradient conflicts at the source; and (2) Off-policy Data Augmentation, which introduces high-quality anchors to recover training signals for challenging tasks. Extensive experiments across 9 mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization benchmarks demonstrate that DaGRPO significantly surpasses existing SFT, GRPO, and hybrid baselines, achieving new state-of-the-art performance (e.g., a +4.7% average accuracy gain on math benchmarks).

We introduce a controlled evaluation framework that probes reasoning reliability through four targeted stress tests: (1) rule deletion, removing either redundant or essential rules from a multi-step inference chain; (2) contradictory evidence injection; (3) logic-preserving rewrites generated through several families of equivalence laws (contrapositive, double negation, implication, De Morgan, identity, and commutativity); and (4) multi-law equivalence stacking that introduces 2-5 simultaneous logical transformations.\n  Across three representative model families: BERT, Qwen2, and LLaMA-like models. Our experiments reveal a strikingly consistent pattern: all models achieve perfect accuracy on the base tasks and remain fully generalise to redundant rule deletion and all equivalence-based rewrites (single or multi-law), but fail sharply under essential rule deletion (dropping to 25% accuracy) and collapse completely in the presence of explicit contradictions (0% accuracy). These results demonstrate that LLMs possess stable invariance to semantic-preserving logical transformations, yet remain fundamentally brittle to missing or conflicting evidence.

The literature on adversarially robust Deep Learning attempts to either enhance the robustness of neural networks (e.g, via adversarial training) or to certify their decisions up to a given robustness level (e.g, by using randomized smoothing, formal methods or Lipschitz bounds). These studies mostly focus on classification tasks and few efficient certification procedures currently exist for semantic segmentation. In this work, we introduce a new class of certifiably robust Semantic Segmentation networks with built-in Lipschitz constraints that are efficiently trainable and achieve competitive pixel accuracy on challenging datasets such as Cityscapes. Additionally, we provide a novel framework that generalizes robustness certificates for semantic segmentation tasks, where we showcase the flexibility and computational efficiency of using Lipschitz networks. Our approach unlocks real-time compatible certifiably robust semantic segmentation for the first time. Moreover, it allows the computation of worst-case performance under $\\ell_2$ attacks of radius $\u03b5$ across a wide range of performance measures. Crucially, we benchmark the runtime of our certification process and find our approach to be around 600 times faster than randomized smoothing methods at inference with comparable certificates on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Finally, we evaluate the tightness of our worstcase certificates against state-of-the-art adversarial attacks to further validate the performance of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7f6eLipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb600\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u5fae\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u50cf\u7d20\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53c8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5177\u6709\u5185\u7f6eLipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53ef\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Lipschitz\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728Cityscapes\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u50cf\u7d20\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u53ef\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb600\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u2113\u2082\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This know-how gap limits Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME), where state-of-the-art codes exist but remain cumbersome for non-experts. We address this bottleneck with GENIUS, an AI-agentic workflow that fuses a smart Quantum ESPRESSO knowledge graph with a tiered hierarchy of large language models supervised by a finite-state error-recovery machine.

We develop and evaluate three clustering pipelines: an autoencoder pipeline, a shape-descriptor pipeline, and a functional-data pipeline. Across a dataset of approximately 126,000 powder images (0.5-102 micrometer diameter), internal validity metrics identify the Fourier-descriptor + k-means pipeline as the most effective, achieving the lowest Davies-Bouldin index and highest Calinski-Harabasz score while maintaining sub-millisecond runtime per particle on a standard desktop workstation. Although the present work focuses on establishing the morphological-clustering framework, the resulting shape groups form a basis for future studies examining their relationship to flowability, packing density, and SLM part quality.

Despite this achievement, LLMs, as data-driven systems, often make incorrect predictions, which can lead to potential losses in safety-critical scenarios. To address this issue and measure the confidence of model outputs, multiple uncertainty quantification(UQ) criteria have been proposed. However, even though important, there are limited tools to integrate these methods, hindering the practical usage of UQ methods and future research in this domain. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce UncertaintyZoo, a unified toolkit that integrates 29 uncertainty quantification methods, covering five major categories under a standardized interface. Using UncertaintyZoo, we evaluate the usefulness of existing uncertainty quantification methods under the code vulnerability detection task on CodeBERT and ChatGLM3 models.

Addressing this gap, this study develops a tailored planning model for Qena City. Using a hybrid methodology (descriptive, analytical, and experimental), the research utilizes Python programming to generate an intelligent spatial analysis algorithm based on Voronoi Diagrams. This approach creates city-specific planning criteria and evaluates the current coverage of public facilities. The primary contribution of this study is the successful derivation of a localized planning standards model and the deployment of an automated algorithm to assess service efficiency. Application of this model reveals a general service coverage average of 81.3%. Ambulance stations demonstrated the highest efficiency (99.8%) due to recent upgrades, while parks and open spaces recorded the lowest coverage (10%) caused by limited land availability.

One simple method for doing so is to include statements describing beliefs maintained in the prompt space (in what we'll call their belief boxes). But when agents have such statements in belief boxes, how does it actually affect their behaviors and dispositions towards those beliefs? And does it significantly affect agents' ability to be persuasive in multi-agent scenarios? Likewise, if the agents are given instructions to be open-minded, how does that affect their behaviors? We explore these and related questions in a series of experiments. Our findings confirm that instructing agents to be open-minded affects how amenable they are to belief change. We show that incorporating belief statements and their strengths influences an agent's resistance to (and persuasiveness against) opposing viewpoints. Furthermore, it affects the likelihood of belief change, particularly when the agent is outnumbered in a debate by opposing viewpoints, i.e., peer pressure scenarios. The results demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the belief box technique in reasoning and decision-making tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\"\u4fe1\u5ff5\u76d2\"\u6280\u672f\u7ef4\u62a4\u547d\u9898\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5bf9\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4fe1\u5ff5\u9648\u8ff0\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u5fc3\u6001\u6307\u4ee4\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6539\u53d8\u503e\u5411\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8ba9\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5177\u5907\u7c7b\u4f3c\u547d\u9898\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u9648\u8ff0\uff08\u4fe1\u5ff5\u76d2\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fe1\u5ff5\u76d2\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a2\u7d22\u4fe1\u5ff5\u76d2\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u9648\u8ff0\u53ca\u5176\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u76f8\u53cd\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\uff1b3\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u653e\u5fc3\u6001\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b4\uff09\u5728\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5c11\u6570\u6d3e\u60c5\u5883\uff08\u540c\u4f34\u538b\u529b\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6539\u53d8\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u5f00\u653e\u5fc3\u6001\u6307\u4ee4\u786e\u5b9e\u5f71\u54cd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u4fe1\u5ff5\u9648\u8ff0\u53ca\u5176\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u76f8\u53cd\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\uff1b3\uff09\u5f53\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u88ab\u76f8\u53cd\u89c2\u70b9\u5305\u56f4\u65f6\uff08\u540c\u4f34\u538b\u529b\u573a\u666f\uff09\uff0c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff1b4\uff09\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4fe1\u5ff5\u76d2\u6280\u672f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u5ff5\u76d2\u6280\u672f\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5f00\u653e\u5fc3\u6001\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u4fe1\u5ff5\u9648\u8ff0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u540c\u4f34\u538b\u529b\u90fd\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Despite recent progress, existing approaches either fail to capture nuanced user preferences or lack effective mechanisms to encode personalized visual signals. In this work, we propose a multimodal framework that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to extract rich user representations and inject them into diffusion-based image generation. We train the MLLM with a preference-oriented visual question answering task to capture fine-grained semantic cues. To isolate preference-relevant features, we introduce two complementary probing tasks: inter-user discrimination to distinguish between different users, and intra-user discrimination to separate liked from disliked content. To ensure compatibility with diffusion text encoders, we design a maximum mean discrepancy-based alignment loss that bridges the modality gap while preserving multimodal structure. The resulting embeddings are used to condition the generator, enabling faithful adherence to both prompts and user preferences.

To resolve this, we propose FlatFormer, a streamlined architecture based on the novel design paradigm of ``Information Injection over Structural Stacking.'' Unlike parameter-heavy hierarchical models, FlatFormer leverages a standard flat Transformer augmented with two lightweight injection mechanisms: (i) a hybrid input encoding strategy combining learnable session identifiers with fixed sinusoidal step embeddings; and (ii) a pre-computed power-law bias integrated directly into attention logits to explicitly model the forgetting curve. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets (e.g., EdNet, Junyi) show that FlatFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, on the EdNet dataset, compared to the strongest hierarchical baseline (HiTSKT), its absolute AUC increased by 8.3%, while using less than 15% of parameters, and inference speed was about three times faster.

Using physics-based constraints, we perform time-resolved reconstruction of nonlinear 3D velocity fields from the evolving free-surface boundary. Experiments under real-sea conditions demonstrate millimetre-level wave elevation prediction in the central region, dominant-frequency errors below 0.01 Hz, precise estimation of high-frequency spectral power laws, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction of nonlinear velocity fields, while enabling dense reconstruction of two million points in only 1.35 s.

Building upon this foundation, recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have further empowered models to autonomously and strategically control search tool usage, optimizing when and how to query external knowledge sources. Yet, these RL-driven DeepSearch systems often reveal a see-saw trade-off between accuracy and efficiency-frequent tool invocations can improve factual correctness but lead to unnecessary computational overhead and diminished efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose LightSearcher, an efficient RL framework that incorporates textual experiential memory by learning contrastive reasoning trajectories to generate interpretable summaries of successful reasoning patterns. In addition, it employs an adaptive reward shaping mechanism that penalizes redundant tool calls only in correct-answer scenarios. This design effectively balances the inherent accuracy-efficiency trade-off in DeepSearch paradigms.

We explain why the expertise in prompt-based segmentation of SAM2 does not transfer to the multimodal concept-driven paradigm of SAM3. SAM2 operates through spatial prompts points, boxes, and masks yielding purely geometric and temporal segmentation. In contrast, SAM3 introduces a unified vision-language architecture capable of open-vocabulary reasoning, semantic grounding, contrastive alignment, and exemplar-based concept understanding. We structure this analysis through five core components: (1) a Conceptual Break Between Prompt-Based and Concept-Based Segmentation, contrasting spatial prompt semantics of SAM2 with multimodal fusion and text-conditioned mask generation of SAM3; (2) Architectural Divergence, detailing pure vision-temporal design of SAM2 versus integration of vision-language encoders, geometry and exemplar encoders, fusion modules, DETR-style decoders, object queries, and ambiguity-handling via Mixture-of-Experts in SAM3; (3) Dataset and Annotation Differences, contrasting SA-V video masks with multimodal concept-annotated corpora of SAM3; (4) Training and Hyperparameter Distinctions, showing why SAM2 optimization knowledge does not apply to SAM3; and (5) Evaluation, Metrics, and Failure Modes, outlining the transition from geometric IoU metrics to semantic, open-vocabulary evaluation.

However, the effectiveness of these policies remains unclear. Here, we analyze 5,114 journals and over 5.2 million papers to evaluate the real-world impact of AI usage guidelines. We show that despite 70% of journals adopting AI policies (primarily requiring disclosure), researchers' use of AI writing tools has increased dramatically across disciplines, with no significant difference between journals with or without policies. Non-English-speaking countries, physical sciences, and high-OA journals exhibit the highest growth rates. Crucially, full-text analysis on 164k scientific publications reveals a striking transparency gap: Of the 75k papers published since 2023, only 76 (0.1%) explicitly disclosed AI use.

When combined with 2D images, 3D data offers machines a comprehensive understanding of their environment, benefiting applications like autonomous driving, robotics, remote sensing, and medical treatment. This dissertation focuses on three main areas: supervised representation learning for point cloud primitive segmentation, self-supervised learning methods, and transfer learning from 2D to 3D. Our approach, which integrates pre-trained 2D models to support 3D network training, significantly improves 3D understanding without merely transforming 2D data. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our methods, showcasing their potential to advance point cloud representation learning by effectively integrating 2D knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76842D\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u652f\u63013D\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53473D\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u53ea\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u8f6c\u63622D\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77403D\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c3D\u6570\u636e\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3002\u7ed3\u54082D\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c3D\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u73af\u5883\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u75282D\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u63d0\u53473D\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u805a\u7126\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u5411\uff1a\u70b9\u4e91\u57fa\u5143\u5206\u5272\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece2D\u52303D\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76842D\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u652f\u63013D\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u96c6\u62102D\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u63a8\u8fdb\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u55843D\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e862D-3D\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Yet current evaluation practice, reporting a single accuracy number from a single run, obscures the variance underlying these results, making it impossible to distinguish genuine capability improvements from lucky sampling. We propose adopting Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), a metric from measurement science, to characterize this variance. ICC decomposes observed variance into between-query variance (task difficulty) and within-query variance (agent inconsistency), highlighting whether reported results reflect true capability or measurement noise. We evaluated on GAIA (Levels 1-3, measuring agentic capabilities across varying reasoning complexity) and FRAMES (measuring retrieval and factuality across multiple documents). We found that ICC varies dramatically with task structure, with reasoning and retrieval tasks (FRAMES) exhibit ICC=0.4955-0.7118 across models, and agentic tasks (GAIA) exhibiting ICC=0.304-0.774 across models. For sub-agent replacement decisions in agentic systems, accuracy improvements are only trustworthy if ICC also improves. We demonstrate that ICC converges by n=8-16 trials for structured tasks and n>=32 for complex reasoning, enabling practitioners to set evidence-based resampling budgets. We recommend reporting accuracy alongside ICC and within-query variance as standard practice, and propose updated Evaluation Cards capturing these metrics. By making evaluation stability visible, we aim to transform agentic benchmarking from opaque leaderboard competition to trustworthy experimental science.

While recent AI video editors perform well on third-person footage, egocentric views present unique challenges - including rapid egomotion and frequent hand-object interactions - that create a significant domain gap. Moreover, existing offline editing pipelines suffer from high latency, limiting real-time interaction. To address these issues, we present a complete ecosystem for egocentric video editing. First, we construct EgoEditData, a carefully designed and manually curated dataset specifically designed for egocentric editing scenarios, featuring rich hand-object interactions, while explicitly preserving hands. Second, we develop EgoEdit, an instruction-following egocentric video editor that supports real-time streaming inference on a single GPU. Finally, we introduce EgoEditBench, an evaluation suite targeting instruction faithfulness, hand and interaction preservation, and temporal stability under egomotion. Across both egocentric and general editing tasks, EgoEdit produces temporally stable, instruction-faithful results with interactive latency. It achieves clear gains on egocentric editing benchmarks-where existing methods struggle-while maintaining performance comparable to the strongest baselines on general editing tasks.

These attacks hijack agent behavior by polluting external information sources, exploiting fundamental trade-offs between security and functionality in existing defense mechanisms. This leads to malicious and unauthorized tool invocations, diverting agents from their original objectives. The success of complex IPIs reveals a deeper systemic fragility: while current defenses demonstrate some effectiveness, most defense architectures are inherently fragmented. Consequently, they fail to provide full integrity assurance across the entire task execution pipeline, forcing unacceptable multi-dimensional compromises among security, functionality, and efficiency. Our method is predicated on a core insight: no matter how subtle an IPI attack, its pursuit of a malicious objective will ultimately manifest as a detectable deviation in the action trajectory, distinct from the expected legitimate plan. Based on this, we propose the Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA), a holistic framework achieving full-lifecycle cognitive supervision. CCA constructs an efficient, dual-layered defense system through two synergistic pillars: (i) proactive and preemptive control-flow and data-flow integrity enforcement via a pre-generated \"Intent Graph\"; and (ii) an innovative \"Tiered Adjudicator\" that, upon deviation detection, initiates deep reasoning based on multi-dimensional scoring, specifically designed to counter complex conditional attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark substantiate that CCA not only effectively withstands sophisticated attacks that challenge other advanced defense methods but also achieves uncompromised security with notable efficiency and robustness, thereby reconciling the aforementioned multi-dimensional trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff08CCA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u56fe\u56fe\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u88c1\u51b3\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8ba4\u77e5\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9632\u5fa1\u67b6\u6784\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u505a\u51fa\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u59a5\u534f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff08CCA\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u652f\u67f1\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u751f\u6210\u7684\"\u610f\u56fe\u56fe\"\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u6267\u884c\uff1b2\uff09\u521b\u65b0\u7684\"\u5206\u5c42\u88c1\u51b3\u5668\"\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u504f\u5dee\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u5206\u542f\u52a8\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728AgentDojo\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCCA\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u5176\u4ed6\u5148\u8fdb\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u590d\u6742\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u663e\u8457\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u59a5\u534f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8c03\u548c\u4e86\u591a\u7ef4\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "CCA\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8ba4\u77e5\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u653b\u51fb\u6700\u7ec8\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\u8fd9\u4e00\u6838\u5fc3\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Project page: https://shoot-bounce-3d.github.io", "summary": "3D scene reconstruction from a single measurement is challenging, especially in the presence of occluded regions and specular materials, such as mirrors. We address these challenges by leveraging single-photon lidars. These lidars estimate depth from light that is emitted into the scene and reflected directly back to the sensor. However, they can also measure light that bounces multiple times in the scene before reaching the sensor. This multi-bounce light contains additional information that can be used to recover dense depth, occluded geometry, and material properties. Prior work with single-photon lidar, however, has only demonstrated these use cases when a laser sequentially illuminates one scene point at a time. We instead focus on the more practical - and challenging - scenario of illuminating multiple scene points simultaneously. The complexity of light transport due to the combined effects of multiplexed illumination, two-bounce light, shadows, and specular reflections is challenging to invert analytically. Instead, we propose a data-driven method to invert light transport in single-photon lidar. To enable this approach, we create the first large-scale simulated dataset of ~100k lidar transients for indoor scenes. We use this dataset to learn a prior on complex light transport, enabling measured two-bounce light to be decomposed into the constituent contributions from each laser spot. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate how this decomposed light can be used to infer 3D geometry in scenes with occlusions and mirrors from a single measurement.

ProAgent then adopts a context-aware proactive reasoner to map these contexts to user needs and tool calls, providing proactive assistance. We implement ProAgent on Augmented Reality (AR) glasses with an edge server and extensively evaluate it on a real-world testbed, a public dataset, and through a user study. Results show that ProAgent achieves up to 33.4% higher proactive prediction accuracy, 16.8% higher tool-calling F1 score, and notable improvements in user satisfaction over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a significant step toward proactive assistants.

However, a lot of existing work often relies on either single-view encoders that fail to exploit the spatial structure of multi-camera systems or operate on aggregated multi-view features, which lack a unified spatial representation, making it more challenging to reason about ego-centric directions, object relations, and the wider context. We thus present BeLLA, an end-to-end architecture that connects unified 360\u00b0 BEV representations with a large language model for question answering in autonomous driving. We primarily evaluate our work using two benchmarks - NuScenes-QA and DriveLM, where BeLLA consistently outperforms existing approaches on questions that require greater spatial reasoning, such as those involving relative object positioning and behavioral understanding of nearby objects, achieving up to +9.3% absolute improvement in certain tasks.

The prevailing practice is to leverage LLMs for log-based failure localization, attributing errors to a specific agent and step. However, this paradigm has two key limitations: (i) log-only debugging lacks validation, producing untested hypotheses, and (ii) single-step or single-agent attribution is often ill-posed, as we find that multiple distinct interventions can independently repair the failed task. To address the first limitation, we introduce DoVer, an intervention-driven debugging framework, which augments hypothesis generation with active verification through targeted interventions (e.g., editing messages, altering plans). For the second limitation, rather than evaluating on attribution accuracy, we focus on measuring whether the system resolves the failure or makes quantifiable progress toward task success, reflecting a more outcome-oriented view of debugging. Within the Magnetic-One agent framework, on the datasets derived from GAIA and AssistantBench, DoVer flips 18-28% of failed trials into successes, achieves up to 16% milestone progress, and validates or refutes 30-60% of failure hypotheses. DoVer also performs effectively on a different dataset (GSMPlus) and agent framework (AG2), where it recovers 49% of failed trials. These results highlight intervention as a practical mechanism for improving reliability in agentic systems and open opportunities for more robust, scalable debugging methods for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

However, its growing deployment in real-world applications raises significant concerns regarding its vulnerability to Presentation Attacks (PAs). Effective Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) is therefore critical to ensure the integrity and security of iris-based biometric systems. While conventional iris recognition systems predominantly operate in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, multispectral imaging across multiple NIR bands provides complementary reflectance information that can enhance the generalizability of PAD methods. In this work, we propose \\textbf{SpectraIrisPAD}, a novel deep learning-based framework for robust multispectral iris PAD. The SpectraIrisPAD leverages a DINOv2 Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone equipped with learnable spectral positional encoding, token fusion, and contrastive learning to extract discriminative, band-specific features that effectively distinguish bona fide samples from various spoofing artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce a new comprehensive dataset Multispectral Iris PAD (\\textbf{MSIrPAD}) with diverse PAIs, captured using a custom-designed multispectral iris sensor operating at five distinct NIR wavelengths (800\\,nm, 830\\,nm, 850\\,nm, 870\\,nm, and 980\\,nm). The dataset includes 18,848 iris images encompassing eight diverse PAI categories, including five textured contact lenses, print attacks, and display-based attacks. We conduct comprehensive experiments under unseen attack evaluation protocols to assess the generalization capability of the proposed method.

However, RL for VLMs requires abundant high-quality multimodal data, especially challenging in specialized domains like chemistry, earth sciences, and multimodal mathematics. Existing strategies such as synthetic data and self-rewarding mechanisms suffer from limited distributions and alignment difficulties, ultimately causing reward hacking: models exploit high-reward patterns, collapsing policy entropy and destabilizing training. We propose DoGe (Decouple to Generalize), a dual-decoupling framework that guides models to first learn from context rather than problem solving by refocusing on the problem context scenarios overlooked by synthetic data methods. By decoupling learning process into dual components (Thinker and Solver), we reasonably quantify the reward signals of this process and propose a two-stage RL post-training approach from freely exploring context to practically solving tasks. Second, to increase the diversity of training data, DoGe constructs an evolving curriculum learning pipeline: an expanded native domain knowledge corpus and an iteratively evolving seed problems pool.

However, model opacity and the lack of interpretability remain critical barriers to clinical adoption, as clinicians often struggle to trust the decision-making processes of black-box models. To address this gap, we present a Cross-modal Explainable Framework for Melanoma (CEFM) that leverages contrastive learning as the core mechanism for achieving interpretability. Specifically, CEFM maps clinical criteria for melanoma diagnosis-namely Asymmetry, Border, and Color (ABC)-into the Vision Transformer embedding space using dual projection heads, thereby aligning clinical semantics with visual features. The aligned representations are subsequently translated into structured textual explanations via natural language generation, creating a transparent link between raw image data and clinical interpretation. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate 92.79% accuracy and an AUC of 0.961, along with significant improvements across multiple interpretability metrics. Qualitative analyses further show that the spatial arrangement of the learned embeddings aligns with clinicians' application of the ABC rule, effectively bridging the gap between high-performance classification and clinical trust.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCEFM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u4e34\u5e8aABC\u6807\u51c6\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9ed1\u8272\u7d20\u7624\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9ed1\u8272\u7d20\u7624\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5df2\u8fbe\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u533b\u751f\u96be\u4ee5\u4fe1\u4efb\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "CEFM\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6295\u5f71\u5934\u5c06\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u989c\u8272\uff09\u6620\u5c04\u5230Vision Transformer\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523092.79%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c0.961\u7684AUC\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u6392\u5217\u4e0e\u533b\u751f\u5e94\u7528\u7684ABC\u89c4\u5219\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "CEFM\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e34\u5e8a\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u8272\u7d20\u7624\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that the view discrepancy arises from supervision limited to pixel- or latent-space video-diffusion losses, which lack explicitly temporally aware, feature-level tracking guidance. We present \\emph{Track4DGen}, a two-stage framework that couples a multi-view video diffusion model with a foundation point tracker and a hybrid 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) reconstructor. The central idea is to explicitly inject tracker-derived motion priors into intermediate feature representations for both multi-view video generation and 4D-GS. In Stage One, we enforce dense, feature-level point correspondences inside the diffusion generator, producing temporally consistent features that curb appearance drift and enhance cross-view coherence. In Stage Two, we reconstruct a dynamic 4D-GS using a hybrid motion encoding that concatenates co-located diffusion features (carrying Stage-One tracking priors) with Hex-plane features, and augment them with 4D Spherical Harmonics for higher-fidelity dynamics modeling. \\emph{Track4DGen} surpasses baselines on both multi-view video generation and 4D generation benchmarks, yielding temporally stable, text-editable 4D assets.

We investigate the impact of persona prompting on strategic performance in PERIL, a world-domination board game. Specifically, we compare the effectiveness of persona-derived heuristic strategies to those chosen manually. Our findings reveal that certain personas associated with strategic thinking improve game performance, but only when a mediator is used to translate personas into heuristic values. We introduce this mediator as a structured translation process, inspired by exploratory factor analysis, that maps LLM-generated inventory responses into heuristics. Results indicate our method enhances heuristic reliability and face validity compared to directly inferred heuristics, allowing us to better study the effect of persona types on decision making.

Laird", "Corey Clark"], "title": "On Memory: A comparison of memory mechanisms in world models", "comment": "10 pages, 1 figure", "summary": "World models enable agents to plan within imagined environments by predicting future states conditioned on past observations and actions. However, their ability to plan over long horizons is limited by the effective memory span of the backbone architecture. This limitation leads to perceptual drift in long rollouts, hindering the model's capacity to perform loop closures within imagined trajectories. In this work, we investigate the effective memory span of transformer-based world models through an analysis of several memory augmentation mechanisms. We introduce a taxonomy that distinguishes between memory encoding and memory injection mechanisms, motivating their roles in extending the world model's memory through the lens of residual stream dynamics. Using a state recall evaluation task, we measure the memory recall of each mechanism and analyze its respective trade-offs. Our findings show that memory mechanisms improve the effective memory span in vision transformers and provide a path to completing loop closures within a world model's imagination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8de8\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u60f3\u8c61\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u5230\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u6f14\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60f3\u8c61\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u533a\u5206\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u6269\u5c55\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u56de\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u6bcf\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u56de\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8de8\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60f3\u8c61\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8de8\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6539\u5584\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u6f14\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u60f3\u8c61\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In the physics of shadow formation, the occluder blocks some light rays casting from the light source that would otherwise arrive at the surface, creating a shadow that follows the silhouette of the occluder. However, such explicit physical modeling has rarely been used in deep-learning-based shadow generation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that embeds explicit physical modeling - geometry and illumination - into deep-learning-based shadow generation. First, given a monocular RGB image, we obtain approximate 3D geometry in the form of dense point maps and predict a single dominant light direction. These signals allow us to recover fairly accurate shadow location and shape based on the physics of shadow formation. We then integrate this physics-based initial estimate into a diffusion framework that refines the shadow into a realistic, high-fidelity appearance while ensuring consistency with scene geometry and illumination. Trained on DESOBAV2, our model produces shadows that are both visually realistic and physically coherent, outperforming existing approaches, especially in scenes with complex geometry or ambiguous lighting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5149\u7167\uff09\u878d\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9634\u5f71\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u83b7\u5f97\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u9634\u5f71", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u5c11\u5229\u7528\u9634\u5f71\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u906e\u6321\u7269\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5149\u7167\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5f62\u72b6", "method": "1) \u4ece\u5355\u76eeRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u83b7\u53d6\u5bc6\u96c6\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c3D\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u5411\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u9634\u5f71\u5f62\u6210\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u521d\u59cb\u9634\u5f71\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f62\u72b6\uff1b3) \u5c06\u7269\u7406\u4f30\u8ba1\u878d\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u5149\u7167\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "result": "\u5728DESOBAV2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u65e2\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u53c8\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u5149\u7167\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u6216\u5149\u7167\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457"}}

This project develops an AI system offering the only end-to-end solution by aiding doctors with both diagnosis and treatment planning. In the diagnosis phase, a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 classification models (Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine) are used. Each model progressively classifies the patient's brain into increasingly specific categories, with the final step being named diagnosis. For treatment planning, an RL system consisting of 3 generative models is used. First, the resection model (diffusion model) analyzes the diagnosed GBM MRI and predicts a possible resection outcome. Second, the radiotherapy model (Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer) generates an MRI of the brain's progression after a user-defined number of weeks. Third, the chemotherapy model (Diffusion Model) produces the post-treatment MRI. A survival rate calculator (Convolutional Neural Network) then checks if the generated post treatment MRI has a survival rate within 15% of the user defined target. If not, a feedback loop using proximal policy optimization iterates over this system until an optimal resection location is identified. When compared to existing solutions, this project found 3 key findings: (1) Using a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 small diagnostic models reduced computing costs by 22.28x, (2) Transformers regression capabilities decreased tumor progression inference time by 113 hours, and (3) Applying Augmentations resembling Real-life situations improved overall DICE scores by 2.9%.

They are crucial for defining the three-dimensional structure of objects and enhancing scene understanding. Yet existing shadow detection methods mainly target cast shadows, and there are no dedicated datasets or models for detecting attached shadows. To address this gap, we introduce a framework that jointly detects cast and attached shadows by reasoning about their mutual relationship with scene illumination and geometry. Our system consists of a shadow detection module that predicts both shadow types separately, and a light estimation module that infers the light direction from the detected shadows. The estimated light direction, combined with surface normals, allows us to derive a geometry-consistent partial map that identifies regions likely to be self-occluded. This partial map is then fed back to refine shadow predictions, forming a closed-loop reasoning process that iteratively improves both shadow segmentation and light estimation. In order to train our method, we have constructed a dataset of 1,458 images with separate annotations for cast and attached shadows, enabling training and quantitative evaluation of both. Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative geometry-illumination reasoning substantially improves the detection of attached shadows, with at least 33% BER reduction, while maintaining strong full and cast shadow performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u8054\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u6295\u5c04\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u9644\u7740\u9634\u5f71\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u9644\u7740\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u9634\u5f71\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6295\u5c04\u9634\u5f71\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u9644\u7740\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u9644\u7740\u9634\u5f71\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u4f53\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5149\u7167\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u79cd\u9634\u5f71\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u5149\u7167\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u4ece\u9634\u5f71\u63a8\u65ad\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u56fe\uff1b\u8be5\u56fe\u53cd\u9988\u5230\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u8fed\u4ee3\u51e0\u4f55-\u5149\u7167\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9644\u7740\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0cBER\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u5c1133%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u6295\u5c04\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6295\u5c04\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u9644\u7740\u9634\u5f71\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8054\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Although clinical notes contain rich, detailed patient information and make up a large portion of electronic health records (EHRs), they remain underutilized for HF readmission risk analysis. Traditional computational models for HF readmission often rely on expert-crafted rules, medical thesauri, and ontologies to interpret clinical notes, which are typically written under time pressure and may contain misspellings, abbreviations, and domain-specific jargon. We present ClinNoteAgents, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that transforms free-text clinical notes into (1) structured representations of clinical and social risk factors for association analysis and (2) clinician-style abstractions for HF 30-day readmission prediction. We evaluate ClinNoteAgents on 3,544 notes from 2,065 patients (readmission rate=35.16%), demonstrating strong performance in extracting risk factors from free-text, identifying key contributing factors, and predicting readmission risk.

They lack runtime introspection, cannot diagnose their own failure modes, and do not improve over time without human intervention. In practice, many agent stacks degrade into decorated chains of LLM calls with no structural mechanisms for reliability. We present VIGIL (Verifiable Inspection and Guarded Iterative Learning), a reflective runtime that supervises a sibling agent and performs autonomous maintenance rather than task execution. VIGIL ingests behavioral logs, appraises each event into a structured emotional representation, maintains a persistent EmoBank with decay and contextual policies, and derives an RBT diagnosis that sorts recent behavior into strengths, opportunities, and failures. From this analysis, VIGIL generates both guarded prompt updates that preserve core identity semantics and read only code proposals produced by a strategy engine that operates on log evidence and code hotspots. VIGIL functions as a state gated pipeline. Illegal transitions produce explicit errors rather than allowing the LLM to improvise. In a reminder latency case study, VIGIL identified elevated lag, proposed prompt and code repairs, and when its own diagnostic tool failed due to a schema conflict, it surfaced the internal error, produced a fallback diagnosis, and emitted a repair plan.

Color evolution of food samples is an important indicator of product quality in food drying. Although existing studies have examined color changes under different drying conditions, current approaches primarily rely on low-dimensional color features and cannot fully capture the complex, dynamic color trajectories of food samples. Moreover, existing modeling approaches lack the ability to generalize to unseen process conditions. To address these limitations, we develop a novel multi-modal color-trajectory prediction method that integrates high-dimensional temporal color information with drying process parameters to enable accurate and data-efficient color trajectory prediction. Under unseen drying conditions, the model attains RMSEs of 2.12 for cookie drying and 1.29 for apple drying, reducing errors by over 90% compared with baseline models.

We prove the taxonomy's visual coherence by training a CNN on raw grid pixels (95.24% accuracy on S3, 36.25% overall, 3.3x chance), then apply the taxonomy diagnostically to the original ARC-AGI-2 test set. Our curriculum analysis reveals 35.3% of tasks exhibit low neural affinity for Transformers--a distributional bias mirroring ARC-AGI-2. To probe this misalignment, we fine-tuned a 1.7M-parameter Transformer across 302 tasks, revealing a profound Compositional Gap: 210 of 302 tasks (69.5%) achieve >80% cell accuracy (local patterns) but <10% grid accuracy (global synthesis). This provides direct evidence for a Neural Affinity Ceiling Effect, where performance is bounded by architectural suitability, not curriculum. Applying our framework to Li et al.'s independent ViTARC study (400 specialists, 1M examples each) confirms its predictive power: Very Low affinity tasks achieve 51.9% versus 77.7% for High affinity (p<0.001), with a task at 0% despite massive data.

Six participating teams were evaluated using a standardized FL setup and a multi-institutional dataset derived from the BraTS glioma benchmark, consisting of 1,251 training cases, 219 validation cases, and 570 hidden test cases with segmentations for enhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and whole tumor (WT). Teams were ranked using a cumulative scoring system that considered both segmentation performance, measured by Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), and communication efficiency assessed through the convergence score.

Among various XAI approaches, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has gained prominence due to its ability to provide both global and local explanations across different machine learning models. While SHAP effectively visualizes feature importance, it often lacks contextual explanations that are meaningful for end-users, especially those without technical backgrounds. To address this gap, we propose a Python package that extends SHAP by integrating it with a large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations. This integration is guided by user-defined parameters (such as feature aliases, descriptions, and additional background) to tailor the explanation to both the model context and the user perspective. We hypothesize that this enhancement can improve the perceived understandability of SHAP explanations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed package, we applied it in a healthcare-related case study and conducted user evaluations involving real end-users. The results, based on Likert-scale surveys and follow-up interviews, indicate that the generated explanations were perceived as more understandable and contextually appropriate compared to visual-only outputs. While the findings are preliminary, they suggest that combining visualization with contextualized text may support more user-friendly and trustworthy model explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u548cGPT\u7684Python\u5305\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6587\u672c\u8bf4\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u975e\u6280\u672f\u7528\u6237\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u6027", "motivation": "SHAP\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u975e\u6280\u672f\u7528\u6237\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027AI\u53d8\u5f97\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1Python\u5305\uff0c\u5c06SHAP\u4e0eOpenAI\u7684GPT\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u7279\u5f81\u522b\u540d\u3001\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u7684\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u76f8\u5173\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u5305\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u674e\u514b\u7279\u91cf\u8868\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u8bbf\u8c08\u8fdb\u884c\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6bd4\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6587\u672c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u521d\u6b65\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5c\u529b"}}

To overcome these limitations, a Practical Interlinked Concept Knowledge Tracing (PICKT) model that can effectively process multiple types of input data is proposed. Specifically, a knowledge map structures the relationships among concepts considering the question and concept text information, thereby enabling effective knowledge tracing even in cold start situations. Experiments reflecting real operational environments demonstrated the model's excellent performance and practicality. The main contributions of this research are as follows. First, a model architecture that effectively utilizes diverse data formats is presented. Second, significant performance improvements are achieved over existing models for two core cold start challenges: new student enrollment and new question addition.

Marlin"], "title": "GPU-GLMB: Assessing the Scalability of GPU-Accelerated Multi-Hypothesis Tracking", "comment": null, "summary": "Much recent research on multi-target tracking has focused on multi-hypothesis approaches leveraging random finite sets. Of particular interest are labeled random finite set methods that maintain temporally coherent labels for each object. While these methods enjoy important theoretical properties as closed-form solutions to the multi-target Bayes filter, the maintenance of multiple hypotheses under the standard measurement model is highly computationally expensive, even when hypothesis pruning approximations are applied. In this work, we focus on the Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filter as an example of this class of methods. We investigate a variant of the filter that allows multiple detections per object from the same sensor, a critical capability when deploying tracking in the context of distributed networks of machine learning-based virtual sensors. We show that this breaks the inter-detection dependencies in the filter updates of the standard GLMB filter, allowing updates with significantly improved parallel scalability and enabling efficient deployment on GPU hardware. We report the results of a preliminary analysis of a GPU-accelerated implementation of our proposed GLMB tracker, with a focus on run time scalability with respect to the number of objects and the maximum number of retained hypotheses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684GLMB\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u540c\u4e00\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u4e2a\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6253\u7834\u68c0\u6d4b\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0GPU\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u968f\u673a\u6709\u9650\u96c6\u7684GLMB\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff09\u867d\u7136\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7ef4\u62a4\u591a\u4e2a\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u91c7\u7528\u5047\u8bbe\u526a\u679d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u865a\u62df\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u652f\u6301\u540c\u4e00\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u4e2a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGLMB\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u540c\u4e00\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u4e2a\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u6807\u51c6GLMB\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u5728GPU\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u521d\u6b65\u5206\u6790GPU\u52a0\u901f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684GLMB\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u5047\u8bbe\u6700\u5927\u6570\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u68c0\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684GLMB\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u53d8\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u652f\u6301\u591a\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728GPU\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u865a\u62df\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches typically treat observations as high-level conditioning inputs to the denoising network, rather than integrating them into the stochastic dynamics of the diffusion process itself. As a result, sampling must begin from random Gaussian noise, weakening the coupling between perception and control and often yielding suboptimal performance. We introduce BridgePolicy, a generative visuomotor policy that explicitly embeds observations within the stochastic differential equation via a diffusion-bridge formulation. By constructing an observation-informed trajectory, BridgePolicy enables sampling to start from a rich, informative prior rather than random noise, substantially improving precision and reliability in control. A key challenge is that classical diffusion bridges connect distributions with matched dimensionality, whereas robotic observations are heterogeneous and multi-modal and do not naturally align with the action space. To address this, we design a multi-modal fusion module and a semantic aligner that unify visual and state inputs and align observation and action representations, making the bridge applicable to heterogeneous robot data. Extensive experiments across 52 simulation tasks on three benchmarks and five real-world tasks demonstrate that BridgePolicy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "BridgePolicy\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6865\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53bb\u566a\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u91c7\u6837\u5fc5\u987b\u4ece\u968f\u673a\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u4ea7\u751f\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBridgePolicy\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6865\u516c\u5f0f\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u5d4c\u5165\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u6865\u63a5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u768452\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBridgePolicy\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "BridgePolicy\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f4\u63a5\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u5f00\u59cb\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

We pretrain a Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) model on SAYCam, a developmentally realistic, egocentric video dataset partially capturing three children's everyday visual experiences.

By building knowledge graphs (KGs), the product matching problem can be converted to the Entity Alignment (EA) task, which aims to discover the equivalent entities from diverse KGs. The existing EA methods inadequately utilize both attribute triples and relation triples simultaneously, especially the interactions between them. This paper introduces a two-stage pipeline consisting of rough filter and fine filter to match products from eBay and Amazon. For fine filtering, a new framework for Entity Alignment, Relation-aware and Attribute-aware Graph Attention Networks for Entity Alignment (RAEA), is employed. RAEA focuses on the interactions between attribute triples and relation triples, where the entity representation aggregates the alignment signals from attributes and relations with Attribute-aware Entity Encoder and Relation-aware Graph Attention Networks. The experimental results indicate that the RAEA model achieves significant improvements over 12 baselines on EA task in the cross-lingual dataset DBP15K (6.59% on average Hits@1) and delivers competitive results in the monolingual dataset DWY100K. The source code for experiments on DBP15K and DWY100K is available at github (https://github.com/Mockingjay-liu/RAEA-model-for-Entity-Alignment).", "AI": {"tldr": "RAEA\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c5e\u6027\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ea7\u54c1\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6DBP15K\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd412\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53476.59%\u7684Hits@1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5c5e\u6027\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4ea7\u54c1\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a\u7c97\u7565\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3002\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528RAEA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5b9e\u4f53\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "RAEA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6DBP15K\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd412\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53476.59%\u7684Hits@1\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6DWY100K\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "RAEA\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u5c5e\u6027\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9e\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea7\u54c1\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing approaches, however, have largely focused on the simpler setting of homogeneous, dense prediction tasks, leaving the more realistic challenge of learning from structurally diverse tasks unexplored. To this end, we introduce NexusFlow, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play framework effective in both settings. NexusFlow introduces a set of surrogate networks with invertible coupling layers to align the latent feature distributions of tasks, creating a unified representation that enables effective knowledge transfer. The coupling layers are bijective, preserving information while mapping features into a shared canonical space. This invertibility avoids representational collapse and enables alignment across structurally different tasks without reducing expressive capacity. We first evaluate NexusFlow on the core challenge of domain-partitioned autonomous driving, where dense map reconstruction and sparse multi-object tracking are supervised in different geographic regions, creating both structural disparity and a strong domain gap. NexusFlow sets a new state-of-the-art result on nuScenes, outperforming strong partially supervised baselines. To demonstrate generality, we further test NexusFlow on NYUv2 using three homogeneous dense prediction tasks, segmentation, depth, and surface normals, as a representative N-task PS-MTL scenario.

With the rise of the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) paradigm, recent works explore synthetic trajectory generation using autoregressive and diffusion models.

This study proposes Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal AutoRegression (M-STAR), a new framework that generates long-term trajectories through a coarse-to-fine spatiotemporal prediction process. M-STAR combines a Multi-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenizer that encodes hierarchical mobility patterns with a Transformer-based decoder for next-scale autoregressive prediction.

While effective on seen classes, such supervision overlooks the rich semantics encoded in category names, hindering the modeling of comparability among cross-category details and, in turn, limiting generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we introduce LaFG, a Language-driven framework for Fine-Grained Retrieval that converts class names into attribute-level supervision using large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Treating each name as a semantic anchor, LaFG prompts an LLM to generate detailed, attribute-oriented descriptions.

While CBMs use supervision to align activations with human-labeled concepts, SAEs rely on sparse coding to uncover emergent ones. We show that both paradigms instantiate the same geometric structure: each learns a set of linear directions in activation space whose nonnegative combinations form a concept cone. Supervised and unsupervised methods thus differ not in kind but in how they select this cone. Building on this view, we propose an operational bridge between the two paradigms. CBMs provide human-defined reference geometries, while SAEs can be evaluated by how well their learned cones approximate or contain those of CBMs. This containment framework yields quantitative metrics linking inductive biases -- such as SAE type, sparsity, or expansion ratio -- to emergence of plausible\\footnote{We adopt the terminology of \\citet{jacovi2020towards}, who distinguish between faithful explanations (accurately reflecting model computations) and plausible explanations (aligning with human intuition and domain knowledge). CBM concepts are plausible by construction -- selected or annotated by humans -- though not necessarily faithful to the true latent factors that organise the data manifold.} concepts. Using these metrics, we uncover a ``sweet spot'' in both sparsity and expansion factor that maximizes both geometric and semantic alignment with CBM concepts.

The core issue is not a lack of knowledge, but a path selection bias within the vast reasoning search space. Although LVLMs are often capable of sampling correct solution trajectories, they disproportionately favor unstable or logically inconsistent ones, leading to erratic and unreliable outcomes. The substantial disparity between Pass@K (with large K) and Pass@1 across numerous models provides compelling evidence that such failures primarily stem from misreasoning rather than ignorance. To systematically investigate and address this issue, we propose PSO (Path-Select Optimization), a two-stage post-training framework designed to enhance both the reasoning performance and stability of existing LVLMs. In the first stage, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with template and answer-based rewards to cultivate structured, step-by-step reasoning. In the second stage, we conduct online preference optimization, where the model samples reasoning paths from GRPO-generated data, self-evaluates them, and aligns itself toward the preferred trajectories. Incorrect or suboptimal paths are concurrently stored in a Negative Replay Memory (NRM) as hard negatives, which are periodically revisited to prevent the model from repeating prior mistakes and to facilitate continual reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments show that PSO effectively prunes invalid reasoning paths, substantially enhances reasoning accuracy (with 7.4% improvements on average), and yields more stable and consistent chains of thought.

As the first comprehensive benchmark for agentic search in local life services, LocalSearchBench includes over 150,000 high-quality entries from various cities and business types. We construct 300 multi-hop QA tasks based on real user queries, challenging agents to understand questions and retrieve information in multiple steps. We also developed LocalPlayground, a unified environment integrating multiple tools for agent interaction. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art LRMs struggle on LocalSearchBench: the best model (DeepSeek-V3.1) achieves only 34.34% correctness, and most models have issues with completeness (average 77.33%) and faithfulness (average 61.99%). This highlights the need for specialized benchmarks and domain-specific agent training in local life services.

However, building a 3D Gaussian is guided solely by photometric loss, which can result in inconsistencies in reconstruction. This under-constrained process often results in \"floater\" artifacts and unstructured geometry, preventing the extraction of high-fidelity surfaces. To address this issue, our paper introduces a novel method that improves reconstruction by enforcing global geometry consistency through constrained multi-view triangulation. Our approach aims to achieve a consensus on 3D representation in the physical world by utilizing various estimated views. We optimize this process by penalizing the deviation of a rendered 3D point from a robust consensus point, which is re-triangulated from a bundle of neighboring views in a self-supervised fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results. On the DTU dataset, our method attains a mean Chamfer Distance of 0.50 mm, outperforming comparable explicit methods.

A Qualitative Analysis of Success and Failure Scenarios of Various LLMs in Agentic Simulations", "comment": "48 pages, 3 tables, 2 listings", "summary": "We investigate how large language models (LLMs) fail when operating as autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities. Using the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1 benchmark, we analyze 900 execution traces from three representative models - Granite 4 Small, Llama 4 Maverick, and DeepSeek V3.1 - across filesystem, text extraction, CSV analysis, and SQL scenarios. Rather than focusing on aggregate scores, we perform fine-grained, per-trial behavioral analysis to surface the strategies that enable successful multi-step tool execution and the recurrent failure modes that undermine reliability. Our findings show that model scale alone does not predict agentic robustness: Llama 4 Maverick (400B) performs only marginally better than Granite 4 Small (32B) in some uncertainty-driven tasks, while DeepSeek V3.1's superior reliability derives primarily from post-training reinforcement learning rather than architecture or size. Across models, we identify four recurring failure archetypes: premature action without grounding, over-helpfulness that substitutes missing entities, vulnerability to distractor-induced context pollution, and fragile execution under load. These patterns highlight the need for agentic evaluation methods that emphasize interactive grounding, recovery behavior, and environment-aware adaptation, suggesting that reliable enterprise deployment requires not just stronger models but deliberate training and design choices that reinforce verification, constraint discovery, and adherence to source-of-truth data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7KAMI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u6790LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5e76\u975e\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u5931\u8d25\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u91cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u6062\u590d\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u805a\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6570\u3002\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528KAMI v0.1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff08Granite 4 Small\u3001Llama 4 Maverick\u3001DeepSeek V3.1\uff09\u5728\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u3001CSV\u5206\u6790\u548cSQL\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684900\u4e2a\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u9010\u8bd5\u9a8c\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u805a\u5408\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1a400B\u7684Llama 4 Maverick\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ec5\u6bd432B\u7684Granite 4 Small\u7565\u597d\uff1bDeepSeek V3.1\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u800c\u975e\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u89c4\u6a21\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u91cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u578b\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u7840\u524d\u63d0\u7684\u8fc7\u65e9\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u66ff\u4ee3\u7f3a\u5931\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e2e\u52a9\u6027\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c61\u67d3\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6267\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u5f3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u7684\u9075\u5b88\u3002\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u5f3a\u8c03\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u6062\u590d\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), a foundational technology, enables cardiac measurement through minute changes in light reflected from the skin. However, practical deployment is limited by the computational constraints of performing analysis on front-end devices and the accuracy degradation of transmitting data through compressive channels that reduce signal quality. We propose a memory efficient rPPG algorithm - \\emph{FacePhys} - built on temporal-spatial state space duality, which resolves the trilemma of model scalability, cross-dataset generalization, and real-time operation. Leveraging a transferable heart state, FacePhys captures subtle periodic variations across video frames while maintaining a minimal computational overhead, enabling training on extended video sequences and supporting low-latency inference.

To address this limitation, we introduce RefBench-PRO, a comprehensive REC benchmark, which decomposes referring expressions into two core dimensions, i.e., perception and reasoning, and further subdivides them into six progressively challenging tasks, such as attribute, position, interaction, commonsense, relation and reject. We also develop a fully automated data-generation pipeline that produces diverse referring expressions across these six sub-dimensions.

We introduce the Agent Capability Problem (ACP), a framework for predicting whether an agent can solve a problem under resource constraints. Rather than relying on empirical heuristics, ACP frames problem-solving as information acquisition: an agent requires $\\Itotal$ bits to identify a solution and gains $\\Istep$ bits per action at cost $\\Cstep$, yielding an effective cost $\\Ceff = (\\Itotal/\\Istep), \\Cstep$ that predicts resource requirements before search. We prove that $\\Ceff$ lower-bounds expected cost and provide tight probabilistic upper bounds. Experimental validation shows that ACP predictions closely track actual agent performance, consistently bounding search effort while improving efficiency over greedy and random strategies. The framework generalizes across LLM-based and agentic workflows, linking principles from active learning, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning through a unified information-theoretic lens. \\", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAgent Capability Problem (ACP)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u80fd\u5426\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u6709\u6548\u6210\u672cCeff\u9884\u6d4b\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u9884\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u80fd\u5426\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u8981I_total\u6bd4\u7279\u8bc6\u522b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b65\u52a8\u4f5c\u83b7\u5f97I_step\u6bd4\u7279\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6210\u672cC_step\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u6709\u6548\u6210\u672cC_eff = (I_total/I_step)*C_step\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eC_eff\u662f\u671f\u671b\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1ACP\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ea6\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u8d2a\u5a6a\u548c\u968f\u673a\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387", "conclusion": "ACP\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u641c\u7d22\u524d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b"}}

Despite their impressive performance, MLLMs suffer from the modality imbalance issue, where visual information is often underutilized compared to textual representations in deeper layers, leading to degraded visual performance or hallucinations. This issue stems from the predominant reliance on next-text-token-prediction during training, which fails to provide direct visual supervisory signals, resulting in progressive homogenization of visual representations throughout the layers. To this end, we propose Latent Visual Reconstruction (LaVer), a novel training framework that facilitates MLLMs in learning more discriminative visual representations via masked image modeling in the joint latent semantic space of LLM. Our method offers direct visual activation to MLLMs, which exhibit increased visual attention allocation, indicating enhanced utilization of visual information. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks prove the superiority of our approach in various scenarios, especially those requiring dense visual capabilities.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce several unified innovations: (1) Multi-Stage Zero-Variance Elimination, which filters out non-informative prompts and stabilizes group-based policy optimization (e.g. GRPO) by removing wasted rollouts; (2) ESPO, an entropy-adaptive optimization method that balances token-level and sequence-level importance sampling to maintain stable learning dynamics; (3) a Router Replay strategy that aligns training-time MoE router decisions with inference-time behavior to mitigate train-infer discrepancies, coupled with a reward model adjustment to prevent advantage inversion; (4) a high-throughput RL system with FP8-precision rollouts, overlapped reward computation, and length-aware scheduling to eliminate performance bottlenecks.

We observe sleeping in home context and classify the sleep disturbances into three types of events: motion events, light-on/off events and noise events. A device with an infrared depth sensor, a RGB camera, and a four-microphone array is used in sleep monitoring in an environment with barely light sources. One background model is established in depth signals for measuring magnitude of movements.

This paper studies black-box multi-turn jailbreaks, aiming to train attacker LLMs to elicit harmful content from black-box models through a sequence of prompt-output interactions. Existing approaches typically rely on single turn optimization, which is insufficient for learning long-term attack strategies. To bridge this gap, we formulate the problem as a multi-turn reinforcement learning task, directly optimizing the harmfulness of the final-turn output as the outcome reward. To mitigate sparse supervision and promote long-term attack strategies, we propose two heuristic process rewards: (1) controlling the harmfulness of intermediate outputs to prevent triggering the black-box model's rejection mechanisms, and (2) maintaining the semantic relevance of intermediate outputs to avoid drifting into irrelevant content. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show consistently improved attack success rates across multiple models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

The core challenge in stroke classification is modeling the semantic relationships between strokes. Our observations indicate that stroke interactions are typically localized, making it difficult for existing deep learning methods to capture such fine-grained relationships. Although viewing strokes from a point-level perspective can address this issue, it introduces redundancy. However, by selecting reference points and using their sequential order to represent strokes in a fine-grained manner, this problem can be effectively solved. This insight inspired StrokeNet, a novel network architecture encoding strokes as reference pair representations (points + feature vectors), where reference points enable spatial queries and features mediate interaction modeling. Specifically, we dynamically select reference points for each stroke and sequence them, employing an Inline Sequence Attention (ISA) module to construct contextual features. To capture spatial feature interactions, we devised a Cross-Ellipse Query (CEQ) mechanism that clusters reference points and extracts features across varying spatial scales. Finally, a joint optimization framework simultaneously predicts stroke categories via reference points regression and adjacent stroke semantic transition modeling through an Auxiliary Branch (Aux-Branch). Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public online handwritten datasets.

Yet, current evaluation practices overwhelmingly report single-run accuracy while ignoring the intrinsic uncertainty that naturally arises from stochastic decoding. This omission creates a blind spot because practitioners cannot reliably assess whether a method's reported performance is stable, reproducible, or cost-consistent. We introduce ReasonBENCH, the first benchmark designed to quantify the underlying instability in LLM reasoning. ReasonBENCH provides (i) a modular evaluation library that standardizes reasoning frameworks, models, and tasks, (ii) a multi-run protocol that reports statistically reliable metrics for both quality and cost, and (iii) a public leaderboard to encourage variance-aware reporting. Across tasks from different domains, we find that the vast majority of reasoning strategies and models exhibit high instability. Notably, even strategies with similar average performance can display confidence intervals up to four times wider, and the top-performing methods often incur higher and less stable costs. Such instability compromises reproducibility across runs and, consequently, the reliability of reported performance. To better understand these dynamics, we further analyze the impact of prompts, model families, and scale on the trade-off between solve rate and stability. Our results highlight reproducibility as a critical dimension for reliable LLM reasoning and provide a foundation for future reasoning methods and uncertainty quantification techniques.

In this work, we aim to exploit the spatiotemporal properties of event streams based on point cloud-based framework, designed to enhance human pose estimation performance. We design Event Temporal Slicing Convolution module to capture short-term dependencies across event slices, and combine it with Event Slice Sequencing module for structured temporal modeling.

We describe our ongoing experiments with an implemented system called DEMOCRITUS (Decentralized Extraction of Manifold Ontologies of Causal Relations Integrating Topos Universal Slices) aimed at building, organizing, and visualizing LCMs that span disparate domains extracted from carefully targeted textual queries to LLMs. DEMOCRITUS is methodologically distinct from traditional narrow domain and hypothesis centered causal inference that builds causal models from experiments that produce numerical data. A high-quality LLM is used to propose topics, generate causal questions, and extract plausible causal statements from a diverse range of domains. The technical challenge is then to take these isolated, fragmented, potentially ambiguous and possibly conflicting causal claims, and weave them into a coherent whole, converting them into relational causal triples and embedding them into a LCM. Addressing this technical challenge required inventing new categorical machine learning methods, which we can only briefly summarize in this paper, as it is focused more on the systems side of building DEMOCRITUS. We describe the implementation pipeline for DEMOCRITUS comprising of six modules, examine its computational cost profile to determine where the current bottlenecks in scaling the system to larger models. We describe the results of using DEMOCRITUS over a wide range of domains, spanning archaeology, biology, climate change, economics, medicine and technology.

With just access to simple functional interfaces (e.g., point coordinates), our approach enables the emergence of complex CAD operations (e.g., pattern replication and mirror). This stands in contrast to previous methods, which typically rely on knowledge injected through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), offer limited support for editability, and fail to exploit the strong generative priors of PLMs. Specifically, the ReCAD framework begins by fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) to equip them with basic CAD model generation capabilities, where we rewrite CAD scripts into parameterized code that is leveraged to generate accurate textual descriptions for supervision. Then, we propose a novel RL strategy that incorporates parameterized code as guidance to enhance the model's reasoning on challenging questions. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical primitive learning process to progressively teach structured and compositional skills under a unified reward function that ensures both geometric accuracy and semantic fidelity. ReCAD sets a new state-of-the-art in both text-to-CAD and image-to-CAD tasks, significantly improving geometric accuracy across in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. In the image-to-CAD task, for instance, it reduces the mean Chamfer Distance from 73.47 to 29.61 (in-distribution) and from 272.06 to 80.23 (out-of-distribution), outperforming existing baselines by a substantial margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReCAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316CAD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u539f\u8bed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230CAD\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5230CAD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6ce8\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bf9\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5229\u7528PLM\u5185\u5728\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742CAD\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u57fa\u672cCAD\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c06CAD\u811a\u672c\u91cd\u5199\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u539f\u8bed\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u9010\u6b65\u6559\u6388\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230CAD\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5230CAD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684SOTA\u3002\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5230CAD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u5e73\u5747Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u4ece73.47\u964d\u81f329.61\uff08\u5206\u5e03\u5185\uff09\uff0c\u4ece272.06\u964d\u81f380.23\uff08\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "ReCAD\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u53c2\u6570\u5316CAD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3aCAD\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We stress-tested sandbagging detection techniques using an auditing game. First, a red team fine-tuned five models, some of which conditionally underperformed, as a proxy for sandbagging. Second, a blue team used black-box, model-internals, or training-based approaches to identify sandbagging models. We found that the blue team could not reliably discriminate sandbaggers from benign models. Black-box approaches were defeated by effective imitation of a weaker model. Linear probes, a model-internals approach, showed more promise but their naive application was vulnerable to behaviours instilled by the red team. We also explored capability elicitation as a strategy for detecting sandbagging. Although Prompt-based elicitation was not reliable, training-based elicitation consistently elicited full performance from the sandbagging models, using only a single correct demonstration of the evaluation task. However the performance of benign models was sometimes also raised, so relying on elicitation as a detection strategy was prone to false-positives. In the short-term, we recommend developers remove potential sandbagging using on-distribution training for elicitation. In the longer-term, further research is needed to ensure the efficacy of training-based elicitation, and develop robust methods for sandbagging detection.

A key difficulty is that jointly processing PAN and MS often entangles spatial detail with spectral fidelity. We propose S2WMamba, which explicitly disentangles frequency information and then performs lightweight cross-modal interaction. Concretely, a 2D Haar DWT is applied to PAN to localize spatial edges and textures, while a channel-wise 1D Haar DWT treats each pixel's spectrum as a 1D signal to separate low/high-frequency components and limit spectral distortion. The resulting Spectral branch injects wavelet-extracted spatial details into MS features, and the Spatial branch refines PAN features using spectra from the 1D pyramid; the two branches exchange information through Mamba-based cross-modulation that models long-range dependencies with linear complexity. A multi-scale dynamic gate (multiplicative + additive) then adaptively fuses branch outputs.On WV3, GF2, and QB, S2WMamba matches or surpasses recent strong baselines (FusionMamba, CANNet, U2Net, ARConv), improving PSNR by up to 0.23 dB and reaching HQNR 0.956 on full-resolution WV3.

While typically applied to image a single molecular species, cryo-EM has the potential for structure determination of many targets simultaneously in a high-throughput fashion. However, existing methods typically focus on modeling conformational heterogeneity within a single or a few structures and are not designed to resolve compositional heterogeneity arising from mixtures of many distinct molecular species.

In this work, we reassess the positioning and role of of multimodal guidance, and propose a Multimodal-Guided Task-Aware Generative Image Compression (MTGC) framework. Specifically, MTGC integrates three guidance modalities to enhance semantic consistency: a concise but robust text caption for global semantics, a highly compressed image (HCI) retaining low-level visual information, and Semantic Pseudo-Words (SPWs) for fine-grained task-relevant semantics. The SPWs are generated by our designed Task-Aware Semantic Compression Module (TASCM), which operates in a task-oriented manner to drive the multi-head self-attention mechanism to focus on and extract semantics relevant to the generation task while filtering out redundancy. Subsequently, to facilitate the synergistic guidance of these modalities, we design a Multimodal-Guided Diffusion Decoder (MGDD) employing a dual-path cooperative guidance mechanism that synergizes cross-attention and ControlNet additive residuals to precisely inject these three guidance into the diffusion process, and leverages the diffusion model's powerful generative priors to reconstruct the image.

However, their real-world deployment remains challenging due to high computational and memory demands. Mixed-Precision Quantization (MPQ), designed to push the limits of quantization, has demonstrated remarkable success in advancing U-Net quantization to sub-4bit settings while significantly reducing computational and memory overhead. Nevertheless, its application to DiT architectures remains limited and underexplored. In this work, we propose TreeQ, a unified framework addressing key challenges in DiT quantization. First, to tackle inefficient search and proxy misalignment, we introduce Tree Structured Search (TSS). This DiT-specific approach leverages the architecture's linear properties to traverse the solution space in O(n) time while improving objective accuracy through comparison-based pruning. Second, to unify optimization objectives, we propose Environmental Noise Guidance (ENG), which aligns Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) configurations using a single hyperparameter. Third, to mitigate information bottlenecks in ultra-low-bit regimes, we design the General Monarch Branch (GMB). This structured sparse branch prevents irreversible information loss, enabling finer detail generation. Through extensive experiments, our TreeQ framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on DiT-XL/2 under W3A3 and W4A4 PTQ/PEFT settings.

This work reframes an editing-purpose latent diffusion model to effectively perceive and process highly ambiguous, layered image inputs, yielding high-quality outputs. We argue that the challenge of this conversion stems from a critical yet overlooked issue, i.e., the latent space of semantic encoders lacks the inherent structure to interpret a composite image as a linear superposition of its constituent layers. Our approach is built on three synergistic components, including a reflection-equivariant VAE that aligns the latent space with the linear physics of reflection formation, a learnable task-specific text embedding for precise guidance that bypasses ambiguous language, and a depth-guided early-branching sampling strategy to harness generative stochasticity for promising results.

However, these methods suffer from conflicting optimization directions between physical and digital attack detection under same category prompt spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Spoofing-aware Prompt Learning for Unified Attack Detection (SPL-UAD) framework, which decouples optimization branches for physical and digital attacks in the prompt space. Specifically, we construct a learnable parallel prompt branch enhanced with adaptive Spoofing Context Prompt Generation, enabling independent control of optimization for each attack type. Furthermore, we design a Cues-awareness Augmentation that leverages the dual-prompt mechanism to generate challenging sample mining tasks on data, significantly enhancing the model's robustness against unseen attack types.

Existing methods lack 3D human structural understanding, producing geometrically inconsistent results with distorted limb proportions and unnatural human-object fusion, while memory-constrained downsampling causes human boundary drift toward background geometry. To address these limitations, we propose to incorporate hybrid geometric priors that combine SMPL human body models with monocular depth estimation. Our approach leverages structured human priors to maintain surface consistency while capturing fine-grained geometric details in human regions.

However, existing TiVR paradigms mainly focus on integrating various visual tools through reinforcement learning, while neglecting to design effective response mechanisms for handling unreliable or erroneous tool outputs. This limitation is particularly pronounced in referring and grounding tasks, where inaccurate detection tool predictions often mislead TiVR models into generating hallucinated reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the VG-Refiner, the first framework aiming at the tool-refined referring grounded reasoning. Technically, we introduce a two-stage think-rethink mechanism that enables the model to explicitly analyze and respond to tool feedback, along with a refinement reward that encourages effective correction in response to poor tool results. In addition, we propose two new metrics and establish fair evaluation protocols to systematically measure the refinement ability of current models.

A Diagnostic Evaluation Framework", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent text-to-video models have enabled the generation of high-resolution driving scenes from natural language prompts. These AI-generated driving videos (AIGVs) offer a low-cost, scalable alternative to real or simulator data for autonomous driving (AD). But a key question remains: can such videos reliably support training and evaluation of AD models? We present a diagnostic framework that systematically studies this question. First, we introduce a taxonomy of frequent AIGV failure modes, including visual artifacts, physically implausible motion, and violations of traffic semantics, and demonstrate their negative impact on object detection, tracking, and instance segmentation. To support this analysis, we build ADGV-Bench, a driving-focused benchmark with human quality annotations and dense labels for multiple perception tasks. We then propose ADGVE, a driving-aware evaluator that combines static semantics, temporal cues, lane obedience signals, and Vision-Language Model(VLM)-guided reasoning into a single quality score for each clip. Experiments show that blindly adding raw AIGVs can degrade perception performance, while filtering them with ADGVE consistently improves both general video quality assessment metrics and downstream AD models, and turns AIGVs into a beneficial complement to real-world data. Our study highlights both the risks and the promise of AIGVs, and provides practical tools for safely leveraging large-scale video generation in future AD pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u751f\u6210\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u539f\u59cbAIGV\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u8fc7ADGVE\u7b5b\u9009\u540e\u53ef\u6210\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u9891\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u9891\u80fd\u5426\u53ef\u9760\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "1) \u5efa\u7acbAIGV\u5e38\u89c1\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff1b2) \u6784\u5efaADGV-Bench\u9a7e\u9a76\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51faADGVE\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ebf\u7d22\u3001\u8f66\u9053\u9075\u5b88\u4fe1\u53f7\u548cVLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b4) \u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b5b\u9009\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u76f2\u76ee\u6dfb\u52a0\u539f\u59cbAIGV\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528ADGVE\u7b5b\u9009\u540e\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7fAIGV\u6210\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AIGV\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684AIGV\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, future affective computing requires more comprehensive and precise emotion metrics which could be measured by VAD(Valence-Arousal-Dominance) multidimension parameters. To address this, AffectNet has tried to add VA (Valence and Arousal) information, but still lacks D(Dominance). Thus, the research introduces VAD annotation on FER2013 dataset, takes the initiative to label D(Dominance) dimension. Then, to further improve network capacity, it enforces orthogonalized convolution on it, which extracts more diverse and expressive features and will finally increase the prediction accuracy. Experiment results show that D dimension could be measured but is difficult to obtain compared with V and A dimension no matter in manual annotation or regression network prediction. Secondly, the ablation test by introducing orthogonal convolution verifies that better VAD prediction could be obtained in the configuration of orthogonal convolution. Therefore, the research provides an initiative labelling for D dimension on FER dataset, and proposes a better prediction network for VAD prediction through orthogonal convolution. The newly built VAD annotated FER2013 dataset could act as a benchmark to measure VAD multidimensional emotions, while the orthogonalized regression network based on ResNet could act as the facial expression recognition baseline for VAD emotion prediction.

To solve this, we propose a region perception-based fusion framework that combines multi-exposure and multi-modal imaging using a spatially varying exposure (SVE) camera. This framework co-fuses multi-modal and multi-exposure data, overcoming single-exposure method limitations in extreme environments. The framework begins with region perception-based feature fusion to ensure precise multi-modal registration, followed by adaptive fusion with contrast enhancement. A structural similarity compensation mechanism, guided by regional saliency maps, optimizes IR-VIS spectral integration. Moreover, the framework adapts to single-exposure scenarios for robust fusion across different conditions.

Among them, next-scale prediction has emerged as a popular paradigm, where models generate images in a coarse-to-fine manner. However, scale-wise AR models suffer from exposure bias, which undermines generation quality. We identify two primary causes of this issue: (1) train-test mismatch, where the model must rely on its own imperfect predictions during inference, and (2) imbalance in scale-wise learning difficulty, where certain scales exhibit disproportionately higher optimization complexity. Through a comprehensive analysis of training dynamics, we propose Self-Autoregressive Refinement (SAR) to address these limitations. SAR introduces a Stagger-Scale Rollout (SSR) mechanism that performs lightweight autoregressive rollouts to expose the model to its own intermediate predictions, thereby aligning train-test patterns, and a complementary Contrastive Student-Forcing Loss (CSFL) that provides adequate supervision for self-generated contexts to ensure stable training. Experimental results show that applying SAR to pretrained AR models consistently improves generation quality with minimal computational overhead. For instance, SAR yields a 5.2% FID reduction on FlexVAR-d16 trained on ImageNet 256 within 10 epochs (5 hours on 32xA100 GPUs).

Firstly, PCNN can use five parallel networks to simultaneously learn local facial features based on eyes, cheeks and mouth to realize the sensitive capture of the subtle changes in FER. Secondly, we utilize a multi-domain interaction mechanism to register and fuse between local sense organ features and global facial structural features to better express face images for FER. Finally, we design a two-phase loss function to restrict accuracy of obtained sense information and reconstructed face images to guarantee performance of obtained PCNN in FER.

Current methods for articulated motion lie at a crossroads: they are either physically consistent but too slow for real-time use, or generative but violate basic kinematic constraints. We present DragMesh, a robust framework for real-time interactive 3D articulation built around a lightweight motion generation core. Our core contribution is a novel decoupled kinematic reasoning and motion generation framework. First, we infer the latent joint parameters by decoupling semantic intent reasoning (which determines the joint type) from geometric regression (which determines the axis and origin using our Kinematics Prediction Network (KPP-Net)). Second, to leverage the compact, continuous, and singularity-free properties of dual quaternions for representing rigid body motion, we develop a novel Dual Quaternion VAE (DQ-VAE). This DQ-VAE receives these predicted priors, along with the original user drag, to generate a complete, plausible motion trajectory. To ensure strict adherence to kinematics, we inject the joint priors at every layer of the DQ-VAE's non-autoregressive Transformer decoder using FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation) conditioning. This persistent, multi-scale guidance is complemented by a numerically-stable cross-product loss to guarantee axis alignment. This decoupled design allows DragMesh to achieve real-time performance and enables plausible, generative articulation on novel objects without retraining, offering a practical step toward generative 3D intelligence.

For such purpose, we present a dual-path transformer framework that leverages CLIP to jointly model visual and attribute-driven cues for gender recognition at a distance. The framework integrates two complementary streams: (1) a direct visual path that refines a pre-trained CLIP image encoder through selective fine-tuning of its upper layers, and (2) an attribute-mediated path that infers gender from a set of soft-biometric prompts (e.g., hairstyle, clothing, accessories) aligned in the CLIP text-image space. Spatial channel attention modules further enhance discriminative localization under occlusion and low resolution. To support large-scale evaluation, we construct U-DetAGReID, a unified long-range gender dataset derived from DetReIDx and AG-ReID.v2, harmonized under a consistent ternary labeling scheme (Male, Female, Unknown). Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed solution surpasses state-of-the-art person-attribute and re-identification baselines across multiple metrics (macro-F1, accuracy, AUC), with consistent robustness to distance, angle, and height variations.

The goal of this study is to design, develop, and validate a comprehensive, multi-modal system that fully automates the monitoring workflow, from data acquisition to the generation of actionable, geo-located maintenance alerts, thereby enhancing plant safety and operational efficiency. The methods employed involve a synergistic architecture that begins with a palette-invariant thermal embedding, learned by enforcing representational consistency, which is fused with a contrast-normalized RGB stream via a gated mechanism. This is supplemented by a closed-loop, adaptive re-acquisition controller that uses Rodrigues-based updates for targeted confirmation of ambiguous anomalies and a geospatial deduplication module that clusters redundant alerts using DBSCAN over the haversine distance. In conclusion, this study establishes a powerful new paradigm for proactive PV inspection, with the proposed system achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.903 on the public PVF-10 benchmark, a significant 12-15% improvement over single-modality baselines. Field validation confirmed the system's readiness, achieving 96% recall, while the de-duplication process reduced duplicate-induced false positives by 15-20%, and relevance-only telemetry cut airborne data transmission by 60-70%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u5149\u4f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u91c7\u96c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u70ed\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8612-15%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u4f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u70ed\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u9700\u6c42\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5149\u4f0f\u7535\u7ad9\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534f\u540c\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u70ed\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684RGB\u6d41\u878d\u5408\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f57\u5fb7\u91cc\u683c\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u91c7\u96c6\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff1b4\uff09\u4f7f\u7528DBSCAN\u548c\u534a\u6b63\u77e2\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u53bb\u91cd\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728PVF-10\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52300.903\u7684mAP@0.5\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534712-15%\uff1b\u73b0\u573a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe96%\uff1b\u53bb\u91cd\u51cf\u5c1115-20%\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u8bef\u62a5\uff1b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9065\u6d4b\u51cf\u5c1160-70%\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f0f\u5149\u4f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u5177\u5907\u73b0\u573a\u5e94\u7528\u51c6\u5907\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Anthropometric measurements, such as waist circumference, limb lengths, and torso proportions to detect Marfan syndrome, can indicate elevated cardiovascular risk. Traditional manual methods are labor-intensive, operator-dependent, and challenging to scale. We present a fully automated deep-learning approach to estimate five key anthropometric measurements from 2D synthetic human body images. Using a dataset of 100,000 images derived from 3D body meshes, we trained and evaluated VGG19, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 with fully connected layers for regression. All models achieved sub-centimeter accuracy, with ResNet50 performing best, achieving a mean MAE of 0.668 cm across all measurements. Our results demonstrate that deep learning can deliver accurate anthropometric data at scale, offering a practical tool to complement athlete screening protocols.

These interactions can range from minor disturbances, such as raccoons in urban waste bins, to more severe consequences, including species extinction. As a result, the monitoring of wildlife is gaining significance in various contexts. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a solution by automating the recognition of animals in images and videos, thereby reducing the manual effort required for wildlife monitoring. Traditional AI training involves three main stages: image collection, labelling, and model training. However, the variability, for example, in the landscape (e.g., mountains, open fields, forests), weather (e.g., rain, fog, sunshine), lighting (e.g., day, night), and camera-animal distances presents significant challenges to model robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios.\n  In this work, we propose a unified framework, called ShadowWolf, designed to address these challenges by integrating and optimizing the stages of AI model training and evaluation. The proposed framework enables dynamic model retraining to adjust to changes in environmental conditions and application requirements, thereby reducing labelling efforts and allowing for on-site model adaptation. This adaptive and unified approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of wildlife monitoring systems, promoting more effective and scalable conservation efforts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faShadowWolf\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4f18\u5316AI\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u4eba\u7c7b\u6816\u606f\u5730\u6269\u5f20\uff0c\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u7a7a\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4eba\u517d\u4e92\u52a8\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e92\u52a8\u4ece\u8f7b\u5fae\u5e72\u6270\u5230\u7269\u79cd\u706d\u7edd\u4e0d\u7b49\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u76d1\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edfAI\u8bad\u7ec3\u9762\u4e34\u73af\u5883\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff08\u5730\u5f62\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u5149\u7167\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540d\u4e3aShadowWolf\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4f18\u5316AI\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u73b0\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "ShadowWolf\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u76d1\u6d4bAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing approaches based on implicit representations like NeRFs suffer from slow rendering and dynamic inconsistencies, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods are typically limited to static head generation, lacking dynamic control. We bridge this gap by introducing AGORA, a novel framework that extends 3DGS within a generative adversarial network to produce animatable avatars. Our key contribution is a lightweight, FLAME-conditioned deformation branch that predicts per-Gaussian residuals, enabling identity-preserving, fine-grained expression control while allowing real-time inference. Expression fidelity is enforced via a dual-discriminator training scheme leveraging synthetic renderings of the parametric mesh. AGORA generates avatars that are not only visually realistic but also precisely controllable. Quantitatively, we outperform state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on expression accuracy while rendering at 250+ FPS on a single GPU, and, notably, at $\\sim$9 FPS under CPU-only inference - representing, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of practical CPU-only animatable 3DGS avatar synthesis. This work represents a significant step toward practical, high-performance digital humans.

With the emergence of Artificial intelligence in the modern world and its vast application in the medical field, we can make an approach to the CAD (Computer Aided Diagnosis) system for the early detection of Brain tumors automatically.

We have achieved an accuracy of 99.38% on the validation dataset making it one of the few Novel Deep learning-based architecture that is capable of detecting brain tumors accurately. We have trained the model on the dataset, which contains images of 3 types of tumors (glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors) and non-tumor cases. and (b) SAS-Net (Self-Attentive Segmentation Network) for the accurate segmentation of brain tumors.

Multimodal automatic depression detection (ADD) offers a promising solution; however, widely studied audio- and video-based ADD methods lack a unified, generalizable framework for diverse depression recognition scenarios and show limited stability to missing modalities, which are common in real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for Stable Cross-Domain Depression Recognition based on Multimodal Large Language Model (SCD-MLLM). The framework supports the integration and processing of heterogeneous depression-related data collected from varied sources while maintaining stability in the presence of incomplete modality inputs. Specifically, SCD-MLLM introduces two key components: (i) Multi-Source Data Input Adapter (MDIA), which employs masking mechanism and task-specific prompts to transform heterogeneous depression-related inputs into uniform token sequences, addressing inconsistency across diverse data sources; (ii) Modality-Aware Adaptive Fusion Module (MAFM), which adaptively integrates audio and visual features via a shared projection mechanism, enhancing resilience under missing modality conditions. e conduct comprehensive experiments under multi-dataset joint training settings on five publicly available and heterogeneous depression datasets from diverse scenarios: CMDC, AVEC2014, DAIC-WOZ, DVlog, and EATD. Across both complete and partial modality settings, SCD-MLLM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models as well as leading commercial LLMs (Gemini and GPT), demonstrating superior cross-domain generalization, enhanced ability to capture multimodal cues of depression, and strong stability to missing modality cases in real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSCD-MLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u7b5b\u67e5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u97f3\u9891\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCD-MLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1) \u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u9002\u914d\u5668(MDIA)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u8f93\u5165\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b2) \u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757(MAFM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6(CMDC\u3001AVEC2014\u3001DAIC-WOZ\u3001DVlog\u3001EATD)\u4e0a\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5b8c\u6574\u8fd8\u662f\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cSCD-MLLM\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u4e3b\u6d41\u5546\u4e1aLLM(Gemini\u548cGPT)\u3002", "conclusion": "SCD-MLLM\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u7ebf\u7d22\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Johnson", "Kevin Leach"], "title": "SUGAR: A Sweeter Spot for Generative Unlearning of Many Identities", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in 3D-aware generative models have enabled high-fidelity image synthesis of human identities. However, this progress raises urgent questions around user consent and the ability to remove specific individuals from a model's output space. We address this by introducing SUGAR, a framework for scalable generative unlearning that enables the removal of many identities (simultaneously or sequentially) without retraining the entire model. Rather than projecting unwanted identities to unrealistic outputs or relying on static template faces, SUGAR learns a personalized surrogate latent for each identity, diverting reconstructions to visually coherent alternatives while preserving the model's quality and diversity.

MediaPipe is chosen primarily for its efficiency and low computational load, enabling the system to run smoothly on edge devices without requiring dedicated hardware. Spoken input from a phone can also be translated into sign representations through a voice-to-sign component that maps detected speech to predefined phrases and produces corresponding GIFs or alphabet-based visualizations. For visually impaired users, the framework provides a screen free voice interface that integrates multilingual speech recognition, text summarization, and text-to-speech generation. These components work together through a Streamlit-based interface, making the system usable on both desktop and mobile environments.

In this work, we propose a masked autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on simulated strong-lensing images from the DeepLense ML4SCI benchmark to learn generalizable representations for two downstream tasks: (i) classifying the underlying dark matter model (cold dark matter, axion-like, or no substructure) and (ii) enhancing low-resolution lensed images via super-resolution. We pretrain a Vision Transformer encoder using a masked image modeling objective, then fine-tune the encoder separately for each task. Our results show that MAE pretraining, when combined with appropriate mask ratio tuning, yields a shared encoder that matches or exceeds a ViT trained from scratch. Specifically, at a 90% mask ratio, the fine-tuned classifier achieves macro AUC of 0.968 and accuracy of 88.65%, compared to the scratch baseline (AUC 0.957, accuracy 82.46%). For super-resolution (16x16 to 64x64), the MAE-pretrained model reconstructs images with PSNR ~33 dB and SSIM 0.961, modestly improving over scratch training. We ablate the MAE mask ratio, revealing a consistent trade-off: higher mask ratios improve classification but slightly degrade reconstruction fidelity.

However, most directly rely on native Transformer attention layers as encoders without evaluating their cross-domain limitations and inherent shortcomings: forgetting important information or focusing on irrelevant representations when modeling long-range dependencies for text detection. The recently proposed state space model Mamba has demonstrated better long-range dependencies modeling through a linear complexity selection mechanism. Therefore, we propose a novel scene text detector based on Mamba that integrates the selection mechanism with attention layers, enhancing the encoder's ability to extract relevant information from long sequences. We adopt the Top\\_k algorithm to explicitly select key information and reduce the interference of irrelevant information in Mamba modeling.

Our study presents two main contributions. First, through systematic evaluation across datasets and acquisition paradigms, we show that models trained with learned sampling patterns exhibitimproved generalization under cross-domain settings. Second, we propose a novel method that enhances domain robustness by introducing acquisition uncertainty during training-stochastically perturbing k-space trajectories to simulate variability across scanners and imaging conditions.

To probe the core issue, we conduct an empirical analysis and observe two characteristic behaviors: (i) fine-tuning VLMs on high-level semantic supervision strengthens semantic discrimination and well generalize to unseen data; (ii) fine-tuning VLMs on low-level pixel-artifact supervision yields poor transfer. We attribute VLMs' underperformance to task-model misalignment: semantics-oriented VLMs inherently lack sensitivity to fine-grained pixel artifacts, and semantically non-discriminative pixel artifacts thus exceeds their inductive biases. In contrast, we observe that conventional pixel-artifact detectors capture low-level pixel artifacts yet exhibit limited semantic awareness relative to VLMs, highlighting that distinct models are better matched to distinct tasks. In this paper, we formalize AIGI detection as two complementary tasks--semantic consistency checking and pixel-artifact detection--and show that neglecting either induces systematic blind spots. Guided by this view, we introduce the Task-Model Alignment principle and instantiate it as a two-branch detector, AlignGemini, comprising a VLM fine-tuned exclusively with pure semantic supervision and a pixel-artifact expert trained exclusively with pure pixel-artifact supervision. By enforcing orthogonal supervision on two simplified datasets, each branch trains to its strengths, producing complementary discrimination over semantic and pixel cues. On five in-the-wild benchmarks, AlignGemini delivers a +9.5 gain in average accuracy, supporting task-model alignment as an effective path to generalizable AIGI detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1-\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06AIGI\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u4f2a\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u7528VLM\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u4e13\u5bb6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684AIGI\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8d44\u6e90\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0VLM\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u654f\u611f\u4f46\u5bf9\u50cf\u7d20\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u50cf\u7d20\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5219\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1-\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u6784\u5efaAlignGemini\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff1a1\uff09\u7528\u7eaf\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\uff1b2\uff09\u7528\u7eaf\u50cf\u7d20\u4f2a\u5f71\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u50cf\u7d20\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u50cf\u7d20\u4f2a\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAlignGemini\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387+9.5%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1-\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u539f\u5219\u5bf9\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316AIGI\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06AIGI\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u4f2a\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1-\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u539f\u5219\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f2\u70b9\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on static or horizontal comparisons -- e.g., spotting visual differences or assessing appropriateness -- while relying heavily on language cues.

To bridge this gap, we present VisChainBench, a large-scale benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LVLMs' ability to perform multi-step visual reasoning across sequential, interdependent tasks with minimal language guidance. VisChainBench contains 1,457 tasks spanning over 20,000 images across three diverse domains (e.g., daily scenarios, engineering troubleshooting), structured to mimic real-world decision-making processes. Uniquely, the benchmark is constructed using a multi-agent generation pipeline, ensuring high visual diversity and controlled language bias.

However, existing segmentation models often struggle to effectively capture local and global contextual information, leading to boundary pixel loss and segmentation errors. In this paper, we propose U-CycleMLP, a novel U-shaped encoder-decoder network designed to enhance segmentation performance while maintaining a lightweight architecture. The encoder learns multiscale contextual features using position attention weight excitation blocks, dense atrous blocks, and downsampling operations, effectively capturing both local and global contextual information. The decoder reconstructs high-resolution segmentation masks through upsampling operations, dense atrous blocks, and feature fusion mechanisms, ensuring precise boundary delineation. To further refine segmentation predictions, channel CycleMLP blocks are incorporated into the decoder along the skip connections, enhancing feature integration while maintaining linear computational complexity relative to input size. Experimental results, both quantitative and qualitative, across three benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of U-CycleMLP in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, achieving better segmentation accuracy across all datasets, capturing fine-grained anatomical structures, and demonstrating robustness across different medical imaging modalities.

We argue that this problem mainly stems from the asymmetric properties between images and text. To enrich the spatial understanding ability of vision-language models, we propose a simple, annotation-free, plug-and-play method named $\\text{Stitch and Tell}$ (abbreviated as SiTe), which injects structured spatial supervision into data. It constructs stitched image-text pairs by stitching images along a spatial axis and generating spatially-aware captions or question answer pairs based on the layout of stitched image, without relying on costly advanced models or human involvement. We evaluate SiTe across three architectures including LLaVA-v1.5-7B, LLaVA-Qwen2-1.5B and HALVA-7B, two training datasets, and eight benchmarks. Experiments show that SiTe improves spatial understanding tasks such as $\\text{MME}_{\\text{Position}}$ (+5.50%) and Spatial-MM (+4.19%), while maintaining or improving performance on general vision-language benchmarks including COCO-QA (+1.02%) and MMBench (+4.76%). Our findings suggest that explicitly injecting spatially-aware structure into training data offers an effective way to mitigate spatial hallucinations and improve spatial understanding, while preserving general vision-language capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faStitch and Tell\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62fc\u63a5\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u9519\u8bef\u63cf\u8ff0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStitch and Tell\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u6cbf\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f74\u62fc\u63a5\u56fe\u50cf\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u62fc\u63a5\u56fe\u50cf\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6807\u9898\u6216\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff1b3\uff09\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u53c2\u4e0e\uff1b4\uff09\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaVA-v1.5-7B\u3001LLaVA-Qwen2-1.5B\u548cHALVA-7B\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff08MME_Position +5.50%\uff0cSpatial-MM +4.19%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff08COCO-QA +1.02%\uff0cMMBench +4.76%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u663e\u5f0f\u6ce8\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3002"}}

However, existing 3DGS watermarking methods remain highly vulnerable to diffusion-based editing, which can easily erase embedded provenance. This challenge highlights the urgent need for 3DGS watermarking techniques that are intrinsically resilient to diffusion-based editing. In this paper, we introduce RDSplat, a Robust watermarking paradigm against Diffusion editing for 3D Gaussian Splatting. RDSplat embeds watermarks into 3DGS components that diffusion-based editing inherently preserve, achieved through (i) proactively targeting low-frequency Gaussians and (ii) adversarial training with a diffusion proxy. Specifically, we introduce a multi-domain framework that operates natively in 3DGS space and embeds watermarks into diffusion-editing-preserved low-frequency Gaussians via coordinated covariance regularization and 2D filtering. In addition, we exploit the low-pass filtering behavior of diffusion-based editing by using Gaussian blur as an efficient training surrogate, enabling adversarial fine-tuning that further enhances watermark robustness against diffusion-based editing. Empirically, comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RDSplat not only maintains superior robustness under diffusion-based editing, but also preserves watermark invisibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "RDSplat\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf93D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6570\u5b57\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u62b5\u6297\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u4f4e\u9891\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u91cf\u4e2d\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093DGS\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u653b\u51fb\u975e\u5e38\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7f16\u8f91\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u6613\u64e6\u9664\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u76843DGS\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u4f1a\u81ea\u7136\u4fdd\u7559\u76843DGS\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff1a\u4e3b\u52a8\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u9891\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u91cf\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b3) \u591a\u57df\u6846\u67b6\u57283DGS\u7a7a\u95f4\u539f\u751f\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c2D\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5c06\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u9ad8\u65af\u4e2d\uff1b4) \u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u7cca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7406\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cRDSplat\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RDSplat\u4e3a3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u6297\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, fine-tuning VLMs in few-shot scenarios poses significant challenges in balancing task-specific adaptation and generalization in the obtained model. Meanwhile, current researches have predominantly focused on prompt-based adaptation methods, leaving adapter-based approaches underexplored and revealing notable performance gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Reconstruction-based Multimodal Adapter (RMAdapter), which leverages a dual-branch architecture. Unlike conventional single-branch adapters, RMAdapter consists of: (1) an adaptation branch that injects task-specific knowledge through parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and (2) a reconstruction branch that preserves general knowledge by reconstructing latent space features back into the original feature space. This design facilitates a dynamic balance between general and task-specific knowledge. Importantly, although RMAdapter introduces an additional reconstruction branch, it is carefully optimized to remain lightweight. By computing reconstruction loss locally at each layer and sharing projection modules, the overall computational overhead is kept minimal.

While an improved ConvNeXt Tiny architecture, integrating Global Average and Max Pooling fusion (GAGM), lightweight channel attention (SEVector), and Feature Smoothing Loss (FSL), demonstrated promising results on Alzheimer MRI under CPU friendly conditions, our work investigates its transposability to mammography classification. Using a Kaggle dataset that consolidates INbreast, MIAS, and DDSM mammography collections, we compare a baseline CNN, ConvNeXt Tiny, and InceptionV3 backbones enriched with GAGM and SEVector modules. Results confirm the effectiveness of GAGM and SEVector in enhancing feature discriminability and reducing false negatives, particularly for malignant cases. In our experiments, however, the Feature Smoothing Loss did not yield measurable improvements under mammography classification conditions, suggesting that its effectiveness may depend on specific architectural and computational assumptions. Beyond validation, our contribution extends the original framework through multi metric evaluation (macro F1, per class recall variance, ROC/AUC), feature interpretability analysis (Grad CAM), and the development of an interactive dashboard for clinical exploration.

Dynamic Token Compression via LLM-Guided Keyframe Prior", "comment": "Accepted by NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have achieved remarkable video understanding capabilities, yet face critical efficiency bottlenecks due to quadratic computational growth with lengthy visual token sequences of long videos. While existing keyframe sampling methods can improve temporal modeling efficiency, additional computational cost is introduced before feature encoding, and the binary frame selection paradigm is found suboptimal. Therefore, in this work, we propose Dynamic Token compression via LLM-guided Keyframe prior (DyToK), a training-free paradigm that enables dynamic token compression by harnessing VLLMs' inherent attention mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that VLLM attention layers naturally encoding query-conditioned keyframe priors, by which DyToK dynamically adjusts per-frame token retention ratios, prioritizing semantically rich frames while suppressing redundancies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyToK achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs. DyToK shows plug-and-play compatibility with existing compression methods, such as VisionZip and FastV, attaining 4.3x faster inference while preserving accuracy across multiple VLLMs, such as LLaVA-OneVision and Qwen2.5-VL.

To address this, we first introduce \\textbf{MedVidBench}, a large-scale benchmark of 531,850 video-instruction pairs across 8 medical sources spanning video, segment, and frame-level tasks, curated through a rigorous quality assurance pipeline with expert-guided prompting and dual-model validation. While supervised fine-tuning on MedVidBench yields noticeable gains, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) fails due to imbalanced reward scales across datasets, which destabilizes optimization and leads to training collapse. To overcome this, we introduce \\textbf{MedGRPO}, a novel RL framework for balanced multi-dataset training with two key innovations: (1) \\emph{cross-dataset reward normalization} that maps each dataset's median performance to a common reward value, ensuring fair optimization regardless of difficulty, and (2) a \\emph{medical LLM judge} that evaluates caption quality on five clinical dimensions through comparative similarity scoring. Supervised fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MedVidBench substantially outperforms GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash across all tasks, demonstrating MedVidBench's efficacy, while our MedGRPO framework further improves upon the SFT baseline across grounding and captioning tasks.

However, existing methods still face two major challenges: their U-Net-based architectures constrain the visual quality of the generated panoramas, and they usually treat the two core tasks independently, which leads to modeling redundancy and inefficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint-face panorama (JoPano) generation approach that unifies the two core tasks within a DiT-based model. To transfer the rich generative capabilities of existing DiT backbones learned from natural images to the panorama domain, we propose a Joint-Face Adapter built on the cubemap representation of panoramas, which enables a pretrained DiT to jointly model and generate different views of a panorama. We further apply Poisson Blending to reduce seam inconsistencies that often appear at the boundaries between cube faces. Correspondingly, we introduce Seam-SSIM and Seam-Sobel metrics to quantitatively evaluate the seam consistency. Moreover, we propose a condition switching mechanism that unifies text-to-panorama and view-to-panorama tasks within a single model. Comprehensive experiments show that JoPano can generate high-quality panoramas for both text-to-panorama and view-to-panorama generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on FID, CLIP-FID, IS, and CLIP-Score metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "JoPano\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eDiT\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u9762\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u5230\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u5230\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u72ec\u7acb\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eU-Net\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u5230\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u5230\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5efa\u6a21\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eDiT\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8054\u5408\u9762\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3DiT\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u8d34\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u56fe\uff1b2\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u6cca\u677e\u878d\u5408\u51cf\u5c11\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u9762\u8fb9\u754c\u5904\u7684\u63a5\u7f1d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u4e24\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728FID\u3001CLIP-FID\u3001IS\u548cCLIP-Score\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5168\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Seam-SSIM\u548cSeam-Sobel\u6307\u6807\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a5\u7f1d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "JoPano\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684DiT\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7edf\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Lake Champlain is particularly vulnerable to recurring CyanoHAB events, especially in its northern segment: Missisquoi Bay, St. Albans Bay, and Northeast Arm, due to nutrient enrichment and climatic variability. Remote sensing provides a scalable solution for monitoring and forecasting these events, offering continuous coverage where in situ observations are sparse or unavailable. In this study, we present a remote sensing only forecasting framework that combines Transformers and BiLSTM to predict CyanoHAB intensities up to 14 days in advance. The system utilizes Cyanobacterial Index data from the Cyanobacterial Assessment Network and temperature data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellites to capture long range dependencies and sequential dynamics in satellite time series. The dataset is very sparse, missing more than 30% of the Cyanobacterial Index data and 90% of the temperature data. A two stage preprocessing pipeline addressed data gaps by applying forward fill and weighted temporal imputation at the pixel level, followed by smoothing to reduce the discontinuities of CyanoHAB events. The raw dataset is transformed into meaningful features through equal frequency binning for the Cyanobacterial Index values and extracted temperature statistics. Transformer BiLSTM model demonstrates strong forecasting performance across multiple horizons, achieving F1 scores of 89.5%, 86.4%, and 85.5% at one, two, and three-day forecasts, respectively, and maintaining an F1 score of 78.9% with an AUC of 82.6% at the 14-day horizon.

With improved zero-shot performance and more effective human-machine interaction, they provide a strong foundation for advancing surgical education and assistance. However, existing research and datasets primarily focus on understanding surgical procedures and workflows, while paying limited attention to the critical role of anatomical comprehension. In clinical practice, surgeons rely heavily on precise anatomical understanding to interpret, review, and learn from surgical videos. To fill this gap, we introduce the Neurosurgical Anatomy Benchmark (NeuroABench), the first multimodal benchmark explicitly created to evaluate anatomical understanding in the neurosurgical domain. NeuroABench consists of 9 hours of annotated neurosurgical videos covering 89 distinct procedures and is developed using a novel multimodal annotation pipeline with multiple review cycles. The benchmark evaluates the identification of 68 clinical anatomical structures, providing a rigorous and standardized framework for assessing model performance. Experiments on over 10 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant limitations, with the best-performing model achieving only 40.87% accuracy in anatomical identification tasks. To further evaluate the benchmark, we extract a subset of the dataset and conduct an informative test with four neurosurgical trainees.

Point-wise loss functions have been widely used to minimize the discrepancy between predicted and absolute gene expression values. However, due to the complexity of the sequencing techniques and intrinsic variability across cells, the observed gene expression contains stochastic noise and batch effects, and estimating the absolute expression values accurately remains a significant challenge. To mitigate this, we propose a novel objective of learning relative expression patterns rather than absolute levels. We assume that the relative expression levels of genes exhibit consistent patterns across independent experiments, even when absolute expression values are affected by batch effects and stochastic noise in tissue samples. Based on the assumption, we model the relation and propose a novel loss function called STRank that is robust to noise and batch effects.

Hence, we propose incorporating both of these powerful visual cues via the Boundary Feature Enhancement and Reflection Feature Enhancement modules in a mutually beneficial way.

Submitted as course project", "summary": "Accurate taxonomic identification of diatoms is essential for aquatic ecosystem monitoring, yet conventional methods depend heavily on expert taxonomists. Recent deep learning approaches improve automation, but most treat diatom recognition as flat classification predicting only one taxonomic rank. We investigate whether embedding taxonomic hierarchy into neural network architectures can improve both accuracy and error locality.\n  We introduce a hierarchical convolutional network with five cascaded heads that jointly predict class, order, family, genus, and species. Each head receives shared backbone features and probability distributions from higher levels, with binary masks restricting predictions to valid descendants during training and inference. Using a filtered dataset of 1,456 diatom images covering 82 species, we compare hierarchical and flat models under identical settings.\n  The hierarchical model matches flat baselines at species level (69.4% accuracy) while outperforming at all upper taxonomic levels. When species predictions fail, errors remain taxonomically local: 92.5 % of misclassified species are correctly predicted at genus level, versus 67.2% for flat baselines. The hierarchical model reduces mean taxonomic distance by 38.2% (1.209 vs. 1.955).\n  Progressive training reveals bidirectional mechanisms: hierarchical constraint masks operate top-down to constrain prediction space, while gradients from fine-grained levels propagate bottom-up through the shared backbone, refining features. This improves class accuracy from 96.2% to 99.5% and yields 6-8% gains at upper levels, producing more robust, interpretable, and biologically aligned predictions for multi-level taxonomic classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u4e8e\u7845\u85fb\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0a\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7845\u85fb\u5206\u7c7b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u4e00\u5206\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ea7\u8054\u5934\u90e8\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u7eb2\u3001\u76ee\u3001\u79d1\u3001\u5c5e\u3001\u79cd\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5934\u90e8\u63a5\u6536\u5171\u4eab\u9aa8\u5e72\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6765\u81ea\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u63a9\u7801\u9650\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\u5230\u6709\u6548\u540e\u4ee3\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u79cd\u7ea7\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u5e73\u9762\u57fa\u51c6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0869.4%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e0a\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u5f53\u7269\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\uff0c92.5%\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7269\u79cd\u5728\u5c5e\u7ea7\u522b\u88ab\u6b63\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u5e73\u9762\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a67.2%\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u7c7b\u8ddd\u79bb\u51cf\u5c1138.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u7ea6\u675f\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u9650\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u9aa8\u5e72\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u53cc\u5411\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this paper, we show that this stochastic noise corrupts fine-grained spatial cues and pushes the model toward timestep-specific noise objectives, consequently destroying meaningful geometric structure mappings. To address this, we introduce $\\mathrm{D}^{\\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor, a noise-free deterministic framework built by reformulating a pretrained diffusion model without stochasticity noise. Instead of relying on noisy inputs to leverage diffusion priors, $\\mathrm{D}^{\\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor views the pretrained diffusion network as an ensemble of timestep-dependent visual experts and self-supervisedly aggregates their heterogeneous priors into a single, clean, and complete geometric prior.

Previous work has demonstrated that models can achieve better planning performance when provided with a prior distribution of possible trajectories. However, these approaches often overlook two critical aspects: 1) The appropriate trajectory prior can vary significantly across different driving scenarios. 2) Their trajectory evaluation mechanism lacks policy-driven refinement, remaining constrained by the limitations of one-stage supervised training. To address these issues, we explore improvements in two key areas. For problem 1, we employ MoE to apply different trajectory priors tailored to different scenarios. For problem 2, we utilize Reinforcement Learning to fine-tune the trajectory scoring mechanism. Additionally, we integrate models with different perception backbones to enhance perceptual features.

This leads to substantial variability in image descriptions. However, existing models for personalized image description focus on linguistic style alone, with no prior work leveraging individual viewing patterns. We address this gap by explicitly modeling personalized viewing behavior as a core factor in description generation. Our method, DEPER (DEscription-PERception persona encoder), learns a subject embedding that captures both linguistic style and viewing behavior, guided by an auxiliary attention-prediction task. A lightweight adapter aligns these embeddings with a frozen vision-language model, enabling few-shot personalization without retraining. Across four datasets spanning diverse viewing tasks and both short and detailed descriptions, DEPER achieves a 24% average improvement, showing that modeling personalized attention produces more human-aligned and high-quality descriptions.

Beyond recognition, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable detailed descriptions and causal reasoning, motivating new tasks: human action understanding (HAU) and human action reasoning (HARn). However, most LLMs, especially large vision language models (LVLMs), struggle with non-RGB modalities such as depth, IMU, and mmWave due to the lack of large-scale data-caption resources. Existing HAR datasets mainly provide coarse data-label annotations, which are insufficient to capture fine-grained action dynamics needed for HAU and HARn. We consider two ground-truth pair types: (1) data label (discrete category) and (2) data caption (textual description). Naively generating captions from labels often lacks logical and spatiotemporal consistency. We introduce CUHK-X, a large-scale multimodal dataset and benchmark suite for HAR, HAU, and HARn. CUHK-X contains 58,445 samples covering 40 actions performed by 30 participants across two indoor environments. To improve caption consistency, we propose a prompt-based scene creation method that leverages LLMs to generate logically connected activity sequences, followed by human validation. CUHK-X includes three benchmarks with six evaluation tasks. Experiments report average accuracies of 76.52% (HAR), 40.76% (HAU), and 70.25% (HARn). CUHK-X aims to enable the community to apply and develop data-intensive learning methods for robust, multimodal human activity analysis.

However, their performance on perception-centric tasks -- such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation -- remains significantly inferior to that of task-specific expert models. For example, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct achieves only 19% mAP on COCO2017 val, particularly struggling with dense scenes and small object recall. In this work, we introduce Chain-of-Thought for Detection (CoT4Det), a simple but efficient strategy that reformulates perception tasks into three interpretable steps: classification, counting, and grounding -- each more naturally aligned with the reasoning capabilities of LVLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves perception performance without compromising general vision language capabilities. With a standard Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, CoT4Det boosts mAP from 19.0% to 33.0% on COCO2017 val and achieves competitive results across a variety of perception benchmarks, outperforming baselines by +2% on RefCOCO series and 19% on Flickr30k entities.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoT4Det\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e09\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8fdc\u4e0d\u5982\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f8b\u5982Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct\u5728COCO2017\u4e0a\u53ea\u670919% mAP\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5c0f\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faChain-of-Thought for Detection (CoT4Det)\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a1) \u5206\u7c7b\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u7c7b\u522b\uff1b2) \u8ba1\u6570\uff1a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\uff1b3) \u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1a\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "CoT4Det\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u5728\u6807\u51c6Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06COCO2017 val\u7684mAP\u4ece19.0%\u63d0\u5347\u523033.0%\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff1aRefCOCO\u7cfb\u5217\u63d0\u5347+2%\uff0cFlickr30k entities\u63d0\u534719%\u3002", "conclusion": "CoT4Det\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Most current fusion networks are tailored to specific tasks and lack the ability to flexibly incorporate user intent, especially in complex scenarios involving low-light degradation, color shifts, or exposure imbalance. Moreover, the absence of ground-truth fused images and the small scale of existing datasets make it difficult to train an end-to-end model that simultaneously understands high-level semantics and performs fine-grained multimodal alignment. We therefore present DiTFuse, instruction-driven Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) framework that performs end-to-end, semantics-aware fusion within a single model. By jointly encoding two images and natural-language instructions in a shared latent space, DiTFuse enables hierarchical and fine-grained control over fusion dynamics, overcoming the limitations of pre-fusion and post-fusion pipelines that struggle to inject high-level semantics. The training phase employs a multi-degradation masked-image modeling strategy, so the network jointly learns cross-modal alignment, modality-invariant restoration, and task-aware feature selection without relying on ground truth images. A curated, multi-granularity instruction dataset further equips the model with interactive fusion capabilities. DiTFuse unifies infrared-visible, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion-as well as text-controlled refinement and downstream tasks-within a single architecture. Experiments on public IVIF, MFF, and MEF benchmarks confirm superior quantitative and qualitative performance, sharper textures, and better semantic retention.

To achieve this, current MLLMs primarily treats bounding boxes as text tokens and generates them autoregressively. However, such autoregressive spatial decoding leads to very-long output sequences, causing spatial errors to accumulated over time and the localization results to progressively drift across a video. To address this, we present a Detector-Empowered Video LLM, short for DEViL, which couples a Video LLM with an open-vocabulary detector (OVD). Specifically, the MLLM and detector are connected via a reference-semantic token (RST) that distills the user query into a rich semantic representation. Unlike tokens that merely serve as spatial prompts or segmentor switches, the RST functions as both a control signal and a replacement for the OVD's text embedding, enabling end-to-end learning of both referential understanding and spatial localization. Furthermore, we propose a tube-mined temporal regularization (TTReg) within OVD, which drives the OVD to generate temporally-consistent queries for target objects, thereby ensuring effective temporal association. Experiments demonstrate that DEViL achieves strong performance across various fine-grained video understanding tasks, particularly STVG and GroundedVQA.

Unlike natural images, charts pair a structured visual layout (spatial property) with an underlying data representation (textual property) -- grasping both is essential for precise, fine-grained chart reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we propose START, the Spatial and Textual learning for chART understanding. Specifically, we introduce (i) chart-element grounding and (ii) chart-to-code generation to strengthen an MLLM's understanding of both chart visual layout and data details. To facilitate spatial and textual learning, we propose the START-Dataset generated with a novel data-generation pipeline that first leverages an MLLM to translate real chart images into executable chart code, recovering the underlying data representation while preserving the visual distribution of real-world charts. We then evolve the code with a Large Language Model (LLM) to ascertain the positions of chart elements that capture the chart's visual structure, addressing challenges that existing methods cannot handle. To evaluate a model's ability to understand chart spatial structures, we propose the Chart Spatial understanding Benchmark (CS-Bench), filling a critical gap in comprehensive chart understanding evaluation.

However, the security of such multimodal systems, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, remains critically underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose RunawayEvil, the first multimodal jailbreak framework for I2V models with dynamic evolutionary capability. Built on a \"Strategy-Tactic-Action\" paradigm, our framework exhibits self-amplifying attack through three core components: (1) Strategy-Aware Command Unit that enables the attack to self-evolve its strategies through reinforcement learning-driven strategy customization and LLM-based strategy exploration; (2) Multimodal Tactical Planning Unit that generates coordinated text jailbreak instructions and image tampering guidelines based on the selected strategies; (3) Tactical Action Unit that executes and evaluates the multimodal coordinated attacks. This self-evolving architecture allows the framework to continuously adapt and intensify its attack strategies without human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate RunawayEvil achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on commercial I2V models, such as Open-Sora 2.0 and CogVideoX.

Existing deep learning methods seek to restore isotropy by leveraging lateral priors, yet their assumptions break down for morphologically anisotropic structures. We present EMGauss, a general framework for 3D reconstruction from planar scanned 2D slices with applications in vEM, which circumvents the inherent limitations of isotropy-based approaches. Our key innovation is to reframe slice-to-3D reconstruction as a 3D dynamic scene rendering problem based on Gaussian splatting, where the progression of axial slices is modeled as the temporal evolution of 2D Gaussian point clouds.

A common defence embeds invisible perturbations into images, but these are fragile and often destroyed by basic transformations such as compression or resizing. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 30 transformations across six categories and show that protection robustness is highly sensitive to the choice of training transformations, making the standard Expectation over Transformation (EOT) with uniform sampling fundamentally suboptimal. Motivated by this, we propose Expectation Over Learned distribution of Transformation (EOLT), the framework to treat transformation distribution as a learnable component rather than a fixed design choice. Specifically, EOLT employs a policy network that learns to automatically prioritize critical transformations and adaptively generate instance-specific perturbations via reinforcement learning, enabling explicit modeling of defensive bottlenecks while maintaining broad transferability.

Yet, endoscopic videos are often degraded by uneven illumination, tissue scattering, occlusions, and motion blur, which obscure critical anatomical details and complicate surgical manipulation. Although deep learning-based methods have shown promise in image enhancement, most existing approaches remain too computationally demanding for real-time surgical use. To address this challenge, we propose a degradation-aware framework for endoscopic video enhancement, which enables real-time, high-quality enhancement by propagating degradation representations across frames. In our framework, degradation representations are first extracted from images using contrastive learning. We then introduce a fusion mechanism that modulates image features with these representations to guide a single-frame enhancement model, which is trained with a cycle-consistency constraint between degraded and restored images to improve robustness and generalization.

Despite significant advances in deep learning for image processing, existing methods have yet to effectively address the challenges of irregular lesion shapes and low contrast. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative encoder-decoder network architecture based on multi-scale residual structures, capable of extracting rich feature information from different receptive fields to effectively identify lesion areas. By introducing a Multi-Resolution Multi-Channel Fusion (MRCF) module, our method captures cross-scale features, enhancing the clarity and accuracy of the extracted information. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Mix Attention Module (CMAM), which redefines the attention scope and dynamically calculates weights across multiple contexts, thus improving the flexibility and depth of feature capture and enabling deeper exploration of subtle features. To overcome the information loss caused by skip connections in traditional U-Net, an External Attention Bridge (EAB) is introduced, facilitating the effective utilization of information in the decoder and compensating for the loss during upsampling.

The FFreeDA setup constrains the FL frameworks to employ only a pre-trained server model as the setup restricts access to the source dataset during the training rounds. Often, this source domain dataset has a distinct distribution to the clients' domains. To address the challenges posed by the FFreeDA setup, adaptation of the Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) methods to FL struggles with client-drift in real-world scenarios due to extreme data heterogeneity caused by the aforementioned domain gaps, resulting in unreliable pseudo-labels. In this paper, we introduce FedSCAl, an FL framework leveraging our proposed Server-Client Alignment (SCAl) mechanism to regularize client updates by aligning the clients' and server model's predictions. We observe an improvement in the clients' pseudo-labeling accuracy post alignment, as the SCAl mechanism helps to mitigate the client-drift.

When the task prompt is simplistic and the image content is complex, achieving effective alignment becomes difficult, limiting the model's ability to focus on task-relevant information. To address this issue, we introduce AerialVP, the first agent framework for task prompt enhancement in UAV image perception. AerialVP proactively extracts multi-dimensional auxiliary information from UAV images to enhance task prompts, overcoming the limitations of traditional VLM-based approaches. Specifically, the enhancement process includes three stages: (1) analyzing the task prompt to identify the task type and enhancement needs, (2) selecting appropriate tools from the tool repository, and (3) generating enhanced task prompts based on the analysis and selected tools. To evaluate AerialVP, we introduce AerialSense, a comprehensive benchmark for UAV image perception that includes Aerial Visual Reasoning, Aerial Visual Question Answering, and Aerial Visual Grounding tasks. AerialSense provides a standardized basis for evaluating model generalization and performance across diverse resolutions, lighting conditions, and both urban and natural scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that AerialVP significantly enhances task prompt guidance, leading to stable and substantial performance improvements in both open-source and proprietary VLMs. Our work will be available at https://github.com/lostwolves/AerialVP.", "AI": {"tldr": "AerialVP\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u7ef4\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfVLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u76ee\u6807\u6df7\u6dc6\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aVLM\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672ctoken\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5f53\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u590d\u6742\u65f6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAerialVP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ece\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u7ef4\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u589e\u5f3a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a(1)\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u9700\u6c42\uff1b(2)\u4ece\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u5de5\u5177\uff1b(3)\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9009\u5b9a\u5de5\u5177\u751f\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAerialVP\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u4e13\u6709VLM\u4e2d\u90fd\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86AerialSense\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "AerialVP\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfVLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing personalization methods often focus on facial identity but fail to preserve broader contextual cues such as hairstyle, outfit, and body shape, which are critical for visual coherence. We propose \\textbf{ContextAnyone}, a context-aware diffusion framework that achieves character-consistent video generation from text and a single reference image. Our method jointly reconstructs the reference image and generates new video frames, enabling the model to fully perceive and utilize reference information. Reference information is effectively integrated into a DiT-based diffusion backbone through a novel Emphasize-Attention module that selectively reinforces reference-aware features and prevents identity drift across frames. A dual-guidance loss combines diffusion and reference reconstruction objectives to enhance appearance fidelity, while the proposed Gap-RoPE positional embedding separates reference and video tokens to stabilize temporal modeling. Experiments demonstrate that ContextAnyone outperforms existing reference-to-video methods in identity consistency and visual quality, generating coherent and context-preserving character videos across diverse motions and scenes.

Although IQA and restoration are closely connected conceptually, most existing work treats them in isolation. Recent advances in unified multimodal understanding-generation models demonstrate promising results and indicate that stronger understanding can improve generative performance. This motivates a single model that unifies IQA and restoration and explicitly studies how IQA can guide restoration, a setting that remains largely underexplored yet highly valuable. In this paper, we propose UARE, to our knowledge the first Unified vision-language model for image quality Assessment, Restoration, and Enhancement. Built on pretrained unified understanding and generation models, we introduce a two-stage training framework. First, a progressive, easy-to-hard schedule expands from single-type distortions to higher-order mixed degradations, enabling UARE to handle multiple degradations. Second, we perform unified fine-tuning of quality understanding and restoration with interleaved text-image data, aligning IQA signals with restoration objectives. Through multi-task co-training, UARE leverages IQA to boost restoration and enhancement performance.

Although recent studies use both audio and visual information, most integrate these cues within a single model, which remains vulnerable to modality mismatches, noise, and manipulation. To address this gap, we propose DeepAgent, an advanced multi-agent collaboration framework that simultaneously incorporates both visual and audio modalities for the effective detection of deepfakes. DeepAgent consists of two complementary agents. Agent-1 examines each video with a streamlined AlexNet-based CNN to identify the symbols of deepfake manipulation, while Agent-2 detects audio-visual inconsistencies by combining acoustic features, audio transcriptions from Whisper, and frame-reading sequences of images through EasyOCR. Their decisions are fused through a Random Forest meta-classifier that improves final performance by taking advantage of the different decision boundaries learned by each agent. This study evaluates the proposed framework using three benchmark datasets to demonstrate both component-level and fused performance. Agent-1 achieves a test accuracy of 94.35% on the combined Celeb-DF and FakeAVCeleb datasets. On the FakeAVCeleb dataset, Agent-2 and the final meta-classifier attain accuracies of 93.69% and 81.56%, respectively. In addition, cross-dataset validation on DeepFakeTIMIT confirms the robustness of the meta-classifier, which achieves a final accuracy of 97.49%, and indicates a strong capability across diverse datasets.

However, due to CLIP's pre-training nature on image-text pairs, it tends to focus on global semantic alignment, resulting in suboptimal performance when associating fine-grained visual regions with text. This leads to noisy and inconsistent predictions, particularly in local areas. We attribute this to a dispersed bias stemming from its contrastive training paradigm, which is difficult to alleviate using CLIP features alone. To address this, we propose a structure-aware feature rectification approach that incorporates instance-specific priors derived directly from the image. Specifically, we construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) based on low-level features (e.g., colour and texture) to capture local structural relationships and use it to refine CLIP features by enhancing local discrimination. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively suppresses segmentation noise, improves region-level consistency, and achieves strong performance on multiple open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u90bb\u63a5\u56fe\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u589e\u5f3aCLIP\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "CLIP\u5728\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5173\u8054\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u3002\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5206\u6563\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528CLIP\u7279\u5f81\u96be\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u989c\u8272\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u533a\u57df\u90bb\u63a5\u56fe\uff08RAG\uff09\u6765\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u56fe\u6765\u7cbe\u70bcCLIP\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5c40\u90e8\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f3a\u52b2\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u533a\u57df\u90bb\u63a5\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6821\u6b63CLIP\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5224\u522b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent works on co-designing camera systems with perception tasks have shown improved task performance. However, most prior approaches focus on optimising fixed camera parameters set at manufacturing, while many parameters, such as exposure settings, require adaptive control at runtime. This paper introduces a method that jointly optimises camera hardware and adaptive camera control algorithms with downstream vision tasks. We present a unified optimisation framework that integrates gradient-based and derivative-free methods, enabling support for both continuous and discrete parameters, non-differentiable image formation processes, and neural network-based adaptive control algorithms. To address non-differentiable effects such as motion blur, we propose DF-Grad, a hybrid optimisation strategy that trains adaptive control networks using signals from a derivative-free optimiser alongside unsupervised task-driven learning. Experiments show that our method outperforms baselines that optimise static and dynamic parameters separately, particularly under challenging conditions such as low light and fast motion. These results demonstrate that jointly optimising hardware parameters and adaptive control algorithms improves perception performance and provides a unified approach to task-driven camera system design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u786c\u4ef6\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5927\u591a\u53ea\u4f18\u5316\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u5236\u9020\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u8bb8\u591a\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u66dd\u5149\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\u9700\u8981\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u65e0\u5bfc\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u56fe\u50cf\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u7b49\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDF-Grad\u6df7\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u5bfc\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In particular, it is crucial to capture the influence that the presence of an individual can have on the others. Important examples of applications include crowd simulation and emergency management, where the simulation of the mass of people passes through the simulation of the individuals, taking into consideration the others as part of the general context. While existing solutions basically start from some preconceived behavioural model, in this work we propose an approach that starts directly from the data, adopting a data mining perspective. Our method searches the mobility events in the data that might be possible evidences of mutual interactions between individuals, and on top of them looks for complex, persistent patterns and time evolving configurations of events. The study of these patterns can provide new insights on the mechanics of mobility interactions between individuals, which can potentially help in improving existing simulation models. We instantiate the general methodology on two real case studies, one on cars and one on pedestrians, and a full experimental evaluation is performed, both in terms of performances, parameter sensitivity and interpretation of sample results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u4eba\u7fa4\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bbe\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4eba\u7fa4\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5e94\u6025\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4ece\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5bfb\u627e\u590d\u6742\u3001\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u6c7d\u8f66\u548c\u884c\u4eba\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7ed3\u679c\u89e3\u91ca", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u79fb\u52a8\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b"}}

Increasingly driven by deep learning, these models learn to approximate data distributions from training examples. This often results in outputs that gravitate toward the average, potentially masking diagnostically important features. More critically, they can introduce hallucinated content, artifacts that appear realistic but are not present in the original tissue, posing a serious threat to downstream analysis. These hallucinations are nearly impossible to detect visually, and current evaluation practices often overlook them. In this work, we demonstrate that the risk of hallucinations is real and underappreciated. While many methods perform adequately on public datasets, we observe a concerning frequency of hallucinations when these same models are retrained and evaluated on real-world clinical data. To address this, we propose a novel image comparison measure designed to automatically detect hallucinations in normalized outputs. Using this measure, we systematically evaluate several well-cited normalization methods retrained on real-world data, revealing significant inconsistencies and failures that are not captured by conventional metrics. Our findings underscore the need for more robust, interpretable normalization techniques and stricter validation protocols in clinical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "WSI\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684WSI\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u5e73\u5747\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u8bca\u65ad\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u662f\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u89c6\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6bd4\u8f83\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u5ea6\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u77e5\u540d\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u77e5\u540d\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7684", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6280\u672f\u548c\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u98ce\u9669"}}

Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces hallucination rates by 9.8 percentage points compared to the baseline, while improving object existence accuracy by 4.7 points on adversarial splits. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms that uncertainty-guided re-attention successfully grounds corrections in visual evidence where standard decoding fails.

However, multimodal representations often suffer from modality dominance, redundant information coupling, and spurious cross-modal correlations, leading to suboptimal generalization and limited interpretability. In particular, high-variance modalities tend to overshadow weaker but semantically important signals, while na\u00efve fusion strategies entangle modality-shared and modality-specific factors in an uncontrolled manner. This makes it difficult to understand which modality actually drives a prediction and to maintain robustness when some modalities are noisy or missing. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Residual Semantic Decorrelation Network (DSRSD-Net), a simple yet effective framework that disentangles modality-specific and modality-shared information through residual decomposition and explicit semantic decorrelation constraints. DSRSD-Net introduces: (1) a dual-stream representation learning module that separates intra-modal (private) and inter-modal (shared) latent factors via residual projection; (2) a residual semantic alignment head that maps shared factors from different modalities into a common space using a combination of contrastive and regression-style objectives; and (3) a decorrelation and orthogonality loss that regularizes the covariance structure of the shared space while enforcing orthogonality between shared and private streams, thereby suppressing cross-modal redundancy and preventing feature collapse. Experimental results on two large-scale educational benchmarks demonstrate that DSRSD-Net consistently improves next-step prediction and final outcome prediction over strong single-modality, early-fusion, late-fusion, and co-attention baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "DSRSD-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6d41\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u76f8\u5173\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6a21\u6001\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u8026\u5408\u548c\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u6a21\u6001\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u8026\u5408\u548c\u865a\u5047\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u6a21\u6001\u5bb9\u6613\u63a9\u76d6\u5f31\u4f46\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u800c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u4ee5\u4e0d\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7ea0\u7f20\u6a21\u6001\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6d41\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u76f8\u5173\u7f51\u7edc(DSRSD-Net)\uff1a1) \u53cc\u6d41\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u6295\u5f71\u5206\u79bb\u6a21\u6001\u5185(\u79c1\u6709)\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4(\u5171\u4eab)\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b2) \u6b8b\u5dee\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5934\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u76ee\u6807\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u56e0\u5b50\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5171\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b3) \u89e3\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f3a\u5236\u5171\u4eab\u6d41\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u6d41\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6559\u80b2\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDSRSD-Net\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u65e9\u671f\u878d\u5408\u3001\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\u548c\u534f\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "DSRSD-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u76f8\u5173\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this trade-off, we propose Generalized Geometry Encoding Volume (GGEV), a novel real-time stereo matching network that achieves strong generalization. We first extract depth-aware features that encode domain-invariant structural priors as guidance for cost aggregation. Subsequently, we introduce a Depth-aware Dynamic Cost Aggregation (DDCA) module that adaptively incorporates these priors into each disparity hypothesis, effectively enhancing fragile matching relationships in unseen scenes. Both steps are lightweight and complementary, leading to the construction of a generalized geometry encoding volume with strong generalization capability.

This paper presents an innovative AI-powered Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) system designed to overcome these limitations by automating underwater object detection, analysis, and reporting. The system integrates YOLOv12 Nano for real-time object detection, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (ResNet50) for feature extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and K-Means++ clustering for grouping marine objects based on visual characteristics. Furthermore, a Large Language Model (LLM) (GPT-4o Mini) is employed to generate structured reports and summaries of underwater findings, enhancing data interpretation. The system was trained and evaluated on a combined dataset of over 55,000 images from the DeepFish and OzFish datasets, capturing diverse Australian marine environments. Experimental results demonstrate the system's capability to detect marine objects with a mAP@0.5 of 0.512, a precision of 0.535, and a recall of 0.438. The integration of PCA effectively reduced feature dimensionality while preserving 98% variance, facilitating K-Means clustering which successfully grouped detected objects based on visual similarities. The LLM integration proved effective in generating insightful summaries of detections and clusters, supported by location data.

Among these, video creation, aimed at generating videos under various conditions, has gained substantial attention. However, existing video creation models either focus solely on a few specific conditions or suffer from excessively long generation times due to complex model inference, making them impractical for real-world applications. To mitigate these issues, we propose an efficient unified video creation model, named VDOT. Concretely, we model the training process with the distribution matching distillation (DMD) paradigm. Instead of using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimization, we additionally employ a novel computational optimal transport (OT) technique to optimize the discrepancy between the real and fake score distributions. The OT distance inherently imposes geometric constraints, mitigating potential zero-forcing or gradient collapse issues that may arise during KL-based distillation within the few-step generation scenario, and thus, enhances the efficiency and stability of the distillation process. Further, we integrate a discriminator to enable the model to perceive real video data, thereby enhancing the quality of generated videos. To support training unified video creation models, we propose a fully automated pipeline for video data annotation and filtering that accommodates multiple video creation tasks. Meanwhile, we curate a unified testing benchmark, UVCBench, to standardize evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our 4-step VDOT outperforms or matches other baselines with 100 denoising steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "VDOT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u84b8\u998f\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5668\uff0c\u57284\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b100\u6b65\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5c11\u6570\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u84b8\u998f\u8303\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5206\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u907f\u514dKL\u6563\u5ea6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3. \u96c6\u6210\u5224\u522b\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\uff1b4. \u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7ba1\u9053\uff1b5. \u521b\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u51c6UVCBench\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c4\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684VDOT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u9700\u8981100\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "VDOT\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5668\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A major barrier is data heterogeneity. This is particularly true in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, where scanner hardware differences, diverse acquisition protocols, and varying sequence parameters introduce substantial domain shifts that obscure underlying biological signals. Data harmonization methods aim to reduce these instrumental and acquisition variability, but existing approaches remain insufficient. When applied to imaging data, image-based harmonization approaches are often restricted by the need for target images, while existing text-guided methods rely on simplistic labels that fail to capture complex acquisition details or are typically restricted to datasets with limited variability, failing to capture the heterogeneity of real-world clinical environments. To address these limitations, we propose DIST-CLIP (Disentangled Style Transfer with CLIP Guidance), a unified framework for MRI harmonization that flexibly uses either target images or DICOM metadata for guidance. Our framework explicitly disentangles anatomical content from image contrast, with the contrast representations being extracted using pre-trained CLIP encoders. These contrast embeddings are then integrated into the anatomical content via a novel Adaptive Style Transfer module. We trained and evaluated DIST-CLIP on diverse real-world clinical datasets, and showed significant improvements in performance when compared against state-of-the-art methods in both style translation fidelity and anatomical preservation, offering a flexible solution for style transfer and standardizing MRI data.

While most existing systems operate in a turn-based manner where the model can only reply after user turns, proactively deciding when to reply during video playback presents a promising yet challenging direction for real-time applications. In this work, we propose a novel text-to-text approach to proactive interaction, where the model autonomously determines whether to respond or remain silent at each turn based on dialogue history and visual context up to current frame of an streaming video. To overcome difficulties in previous methods such as manually tuning response decision thresholds and annotating precise reply times, we introduce a multi-turn RL based training method that encourages timely and accurate responses without requiring precise response time annotations. We train our model MMDuet2 on a dataset of 52k videos with two types of dialogues via SFT and RL. Experimental results demonstrate that MMDuet2 outperforms existing proactive Video MLLM baselines in response timing and quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ProactiveVideoQA benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMMDuet2\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u8f6eRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3b\u52a8\u51b3\u5b9a\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u64ad\u653e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f55\u65f6\u56de\u5e94\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u56de\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891MLLM\u5927\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u56de\u5408\u5236\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u7528\u6237\u56de\u5408\u540e\u56de\u590d\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u52a8\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u64ad\u653e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u56de\u5e94\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6587\u672c\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u5f53\u524d\u5e27\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u5b9a\u56de\u5e94\u6216\u4fdd\u6301\u6c89\u9ed8\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u8f6eRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u56de\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u53ca\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u572852k\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7SFT\u548cRL\u8bad\u7ec3MMDuet2\uff0c\u5728ProactiveVideoQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u9891MLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u56de\u5e94\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MMDuet2\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6eRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u56de\u5e94\u51b3\u7b56\u9608\u503c\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u7cbe\u786e\u56de\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce Negative Prompting for Image Correction (NPC), an automated pipeline that improves alignment by identifying and applying negative prompts that suppress unintended content. We begin by analyzing cross-attention patterns to explain why both targeted negatives-those directly tied to the prompt's alignment error-and untargeted negatives-tokens unrelated to the prompt but present in the generated image-can enhance alignment. To discover useful negatives, NPC generates candidate prompts using a verifier-captioner-proposer framework and ranks them with a salient text-space score, enabling effective selection without requiring additional image synthesis. On GenEval++ and Imagine-Bench, NPC outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.571 vs. 0.371 on GenEval++ and the best overall performance on Imagine-Bench. By guiding what not to generate, NPC provides a principled, fully automated route to stronger text-image alignment in diffusion models.

Action information can be extracted from the body pose and movements, as well as from the background scene. However, the extent to which deep neural networks (DNNs) make use of information about the body and information about the background remains unclear. Since these two sources of information may be correlated within a training dataset, DNNs might learn to rely predominantly on one of them, without taking full advantage of the other. Unlike DNNs, humans have domain-specific brain regions selective for perceiving bodies, and regions selective for perceiving scenes. The present work tests whether humans are thus more effective at extracting information from both body and background, and whether building brain-inspired deep network architectures with separate domain-specific streams for body and scene perception endows them with more human-like performance. We first demonstrate that DNNs trained using the HAA500 dataset perform almost as accurately on versions of the stimuli that show both body and background and on versions of the stimuli from which the body was removed, but are at chance-level for versions of the stimuli from which the background was removed. Conversely, human participants (N=28) can recognize the same set of actions accurately with all three versions of the stimuli, and perform significantly better on stimuli that show only the body than on stimuli that show only the background. Finally, we implement and test a novel architecture patterned after domain specificity in the brain with separate streams to process body and background information. We show that 1) this architecture improves action recognition performance, and 2) its accuracy across different versions of the stimuli follows a pattern that matches more closely the pattern of accuracy observed in human participants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8eab\u4f53\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5229\u7528\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53d7\u5927\u8111\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u53cc\u6d41\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8eab\u4f53\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u53d7\u5927\u8111\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u542f\u53d1\u80fd\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784", "method": "1) \u6bd4\u8f83DNN\u5728HAA500\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u65e0\u8eab\u4f53\u3001\u65e0\u80cc\u666f\u4e09\u79cd\u523a\u6fc0\u7248\u672c\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b2) \u6d4b\u8bd528\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d7\u5927\u8111\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u53cc\u6d41\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u8eab\u4f53\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5", "result": "1) DNN\u5728\u65e0\u80cc\u666f\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u65e0\u8eab\u4f53\u523a\u6fc0\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b2) \u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u79cd\u523a\u6fc0\u7248\u672c\u4e0a\u90fd\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u8eab\u4f53\u7684\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u6709\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u523a\u6fc0\uff1b3) \u53cc\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u523a\u6fc0\u7248\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6a21\u5f0f\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0", "conclusion": "\u53d7\u5927\u8111\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u53cc\u6d41\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u8eab\u4f53\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}

To address this, we propose SAVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Driven Visual Information Enhancement), a framework that mitigates hallucination by steering the model along Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) latent features. A binary object-presence question-answering probe identifies the SAE features most indicative of the model's visual information processing, referred to as visual understanding features. Steering the model along these identified features reinforces grounded visual understanding and effectively reduces hallucination. With its simple design, SAVE outperforms state-of-the-art training-free methods on standard benchmarks, achieving a 10\\%p improvement in CHAIR\\_S and consistent gains on POPE and MMHal-Bench. Extensive evaluations across multiple models and layers confirm the robustness and generalizability of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering along visual understanding features suppresses the generation of uncertain object tokens and increases attention to image tokens, mitigating hallucination.

However, current approaches sharing dense Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features are constrained by quadratically-scaling communication costs and the lack of flexibility and interpretability for precise alignment across asynchronous or disparate viewpoints. While emerging sparse query-based methods offer an alternative, they often suffer from inadequate geometric representations, suboptimal fusion strategies, and training instability. In this paper, we propose SparseCoop, a fully sparse cooperative perception framework for 3D detection and tracking that completely discards intermediate BEV representations. Our framework features a trio of innovations: a kinematic-grounded instance query that uses an explicit state vector with 3D geometry and velocity for precise spatio-temporal alignment; a coarse-to-fine aggregation module for robust fusion; and a cooperative instance denoising task to accelerate and stabilize training. Experiments on V2X-Seq and Griffin datasets show SparseCoop achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it delivers this with superior computational efficiency, low transmission cost, and strong robustness to communication latency.

Mitra", "Qixing Huang"], "title": "WorldReel: 4D Video Generation with Consistent Geometry and Motion Modeling", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent video generators achieve striking photorealism, yet remain fundamentally inconsistent in 3D. We present WorldReel, a 4D video generator that is natively spatio-temporally consistent. WorldReel jointly produces RGB frames together with 4D scene representations, including pointmaps, camera trajectory, and dense flow mapping, enabling coherent geometry and appearance modeling over time. Our explicit 4D representation enforces a single underlying scene that persists across viewpoints and dynamic content, yielding videos that remain consistent even under large non-rigid motion and significant camera movement. We train WorldReel by carefully combining synthetic and real data: synthetic data providing precise 4D supervision (geometry, motion, and camera), while real videos contribute visual diversity and realism. This blend allows WorldReel to generalize to in-the-wild footage while preserving strong geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WorldReel sets a new state-of-the-art for consistent video generation with dynamic scenes and moving cameras, improving metrics of geometric consistency, motion coherence, and reducing view-time artifacts over competing methods.

In recent years, weakly-supervised VAD (WVAD) have attracted considerable attention due to their easy annotation process and promising research results. While existing WVAD methods tackle mainly on static datasets, the possibility that the domain of data can vary has been neglected. To adapt such domain-shift, the continual learning (CL) perspective is required because otherwise additional training only with new coming data could easily cause performance degradation for previous data, i.e., forgetting. Therefore, we propose a brand-new approach, called Continual Anomaly Detection with Ensembles (CADE) that is the first work combining CL and WVAD viewpoints. Specifically, CADE uses the Dual-Generator(DG) to address data imbalance and label uncertainty in WVAD. We also found that forgetting exacerbates the \"incompleteness'' where the model becomes biased towards certain anomaly modes, leading to missed detections of various anomalies. To address this, we propose to ensemble Multi-Discriminator (MD) that capture missed anomalies in past scenes due to forgetting, using multiple models.

In parallel, there has been growing interest in leveraging high-quality pre-trained visual representations, either by aligning them inside VAEs or directly within the generative model. However, adapting such representations remains challenging due to fundamental mismatches between understanding-oriented features and generation-friendly latent spaces. Representation encoders benefit from high-dimensional latents that capture diverse hypotheses for masked regions, whereas generative models favor low-dimensional latents that must faithfully preserve injected noise. This discrepancy has led prior work to rely on complex objectives and architectures. In this work, we propose FAE (Feature Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective framework that adapts pre-trained visual representations into low-dimensional latents suitable for generation using as little as a single attention layer, while retaining sufficient information for both reconstruction and understanding. The key is to couple two separate deep decoders: one trained to reconstruct the original feature space, and a second that takes the reconstructed features as input for image generation. FAE is generic; it can be instantiated with a variety of self-supervised encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP) and plugged into two distinct generative families: diffusion models and normalizing flows. Across class-conditional and text-to-image benchmarks, FAE achieves strong performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256, our diffusion model with CFG attains a near state-of-the-art FID of 1.29 (800 epochs) and 1.70 (80 epochs). Without CFG, FAE reaches the state-of-the-art FID of 1.48 (800 epochs) and 2.08 (80 epochs), demonstrating both high quality and fast learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "FAE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u9002\u914d\u5230\u9002\u5408\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5c06\u7406\u89e3\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u9002\u914d\u5230\u751f\u6210\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8868\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9700\u8981\u6355\u6349\u63a9\u7801\u533a\u57df\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4fdd\u7559\u6ce8\u5165\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFAE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8026\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u91cd\u5efa\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5982DINO\u3001SigLIP\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u914d\u5230\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u4e24\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet 256x256\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e26CFG\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1SOTA\u7684FID 1.29\uff08800\u8f6e\uff09\u548c1.70\uff0880\u8f6e\uff09\uff1b\u4e0d\u5e26CFG\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u7684FID 1.48\uff08800\u8f6e\uff09\u548c2.08\uff0880\u8f6e\uff09\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "FAE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u9002\u914d\u5230\u751f\u6210\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6700\u5c0f\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

We address this by training without any real abnormal videos while evaluating under the standard weakly supervised split, and we introduce PA-VAD, a generation-driven approach that learns a detector from synthesized pseudo-abnormal videos paired with real normal videos, using only a small set of real normal images to drive synthesis. For synthesis, we select class-relevant initial images with CLIP and refine textual prompts with a vision-language model to improve fidelity and scene consistency before invoking a video diffusion model. For training, we mitigate excessive spatiotemporal magnitude in synthesized anomalies by an domain-aligned regularized module that combines domain alignment and memory usage-aware updates. Extensive experiments show that our approach reaches 98.2% on ShanghaiTech and 82.5% on UCF-Crime, surpassing the strongest real-abnormal method on ShanghaiTech by +0.6% and outperforming the UVAD state-of-the-art on UCF-Crime by +1.9%.

An apple is like a peach because both are reddish fruit, but the Earth is also like a peach: its crust, mantle, and core correspond to the peach's skin, flesh, and pit. This ability to perceive and recognize relational similarity, is arguable by cognitive scientist to be what distinguishes humans from other species. Yet, all widely used visual similarity metrics today (e.g., LPIPS, CLIP, DINO) focus solely on perceptual attribute similarity and fail to capture the rich, often surprising relational similarities that humans perceive. How can we go beyond the visible content of an image to capture its relational properties? How can we bring images with the same relational logic closer together in representation space? To answer these questions, we first formulate relational image similarity as a measurable problem: two images are relationally similar when their internal relations or functions among visual elements correspond, even if their visual attributes differ. We then curate 114k image-caption dataset in which the captions are anonymized -- describing the underlying relational logic of the scene rather than its surface content. Using this dataset, we finetune a Vision-Language model to measure the relational similarity between images. This model serves as the first step toward connecting images by their underlying relational structure rather than their visible appearance. Our study shows that while relational similarity has a lot of real-world applications, existing image similarity models fail to capture it -- revealing a critical gap in visual computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u7cfb\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u6d4b\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u611f\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u7cfb\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff08\u5982\u5730\u7403\u4e0e\u6843\u5b50\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08LPIPS\u3001CLIP\u3001DINO\u7b49\uff09\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u611f\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u5173\u7cfb\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2. \u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b11.4\u4e07\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf-\u533f\u540d\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u903b\u8f91\u800c\u975e\u8868\u9762\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u8fde\u63a5\u56fe\u50cf\u5e95\u5c42\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u8868\u9762\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5173\u7cfb\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5177\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5173\u7cfb\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u662f\u89c6\u89c9\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We introduce a weakly supervised method trained solely on vertebra-level healthy/malignant labels, without any lesion masks. The method combines a Diffusion Autoencoder (DAE) that produces a classifier-guided healthy edit of each vertebra with pixel-wise difference maps that propose candidate lesion regions. To determine which regions truly reflect malignancy, we introduce Hide-and-Seek Attribution: each candidate is revealed in turn while all others are hidden, the edited image is projected back to the data manifold by the DAE, and a latent-space classifier quantifies the isolated malignant contribution of that component. High-scoring regions form the final lytic or blastic segmentation. On held-out radiologist annotations, we achieve strong blastic/lytic performance despite no mask supervision (F1: 0.91/0.85; Dice: 0.87/0.78), exceeding baselines (F1: 0.79/0.67; Dice: 0.74/0.55).

Compared with existing unimodally conditioned segmentation tasks, such as RIS and visual RIS, OmniRIS supports the input of text instructions and reference images with masks, boxes or scribbles as omni-prompts. This property makes it can well exploit the intrinsic merits of both text and visual modalities, i.e., granular attribute referring and uncommon object grounding, respectively. Besides, OmniRIS can also handle various segmentation settings, such as one v.s. many and many v.s. many, further facilitating its practical use. To promote the research of OmniRIS, we also rigorously design and construct a large dataset termed OmniRef, which consists of 186,939 omni-prompts for 30,956 images, and establish a comprehensive evaluation system. Moreover, a strong and general baseline termed OmniSegNet is also proposed to tackle the key challenges of OmniRIS, such as omni-prompt encoding.

However, this paradigm is limited by the drive-time perception horizon and often fails under limited view scope, occlusion or extreme conditions such as darkness and rain.

To endow models with this ``recall\" ability, we propose the spatial retrieval paradigm, introducing offline retrieved geographic images as an additional input. These images are easy to obtain from offline caches (e.g, Google Maps or stored autonomous driving datasets) without requiring additional sensors, making it a plug-and-play extension for existing AD tasks.\n  For experiments, we first extend the nuScenes dataset with geographic images retrieved via Google Maps APIs and align the new data with ego-vehicle trajectories. We establish baselines across five core autonomous driving tasks: object detection, online mapping, occupancy prediction, end-to-end planning, and generative world modeling.

Despite its success, this paradigm can generate erroneous pseudo-labels, which are further amplified during training due to utilization of one-hot encoding. To address this issue, we propose ECOCSeg, a novel perspective for segmentation models that utilizes error-correcting output codes (ECOC) to create a fine-grained encoding for each class. ECOCSeg offers several advantages. First, an ECOC-based classifier is introduced, enabling model to disentangle classes into attributes and handle partial inaccurate bits, improving stability and generalization in pseudo-label learning.

Despite recent progress with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), the task remains challenging due to variations in spatial resolution, viewpoint, orientation, and background conditions, which often reduce the generalization ability of existing models. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight architecture based on the convolutional mixer paradigm. The model alternates between spatial mixing through depthwise convolutions at multiple scales and channel mixing through pointwise operations, enabling efficient extraction of both local and contextual information while keeping the number of parameters and computations low. Extensive experiments were conducted on the AID and EuroSAT benchmarks. The proposed model achieved overall accuracy, average accuracy, and Kappa values of 74.7%, 74.57%, and 73.79 on the AID dataset, and 93.90%, 93.93%, and 93.22 on EuroSAT, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a good balance between accuracy and efficiency compared with widely used CNN- and transformer-based models.

Supplementary video and poster available upon request", "summary": "Reliable 3D segmentation is critical for understanding complex scenes with dense layouts and multi-scale objects, as commonly seen in industrial environments. In such scenarios, heavy occlusion weakens geometric boundaries between objects, and large differences in object scale will cause end-to-end models fail to capture both coarse and fine details accurately. Existing 3D point-based methods require costly annotations, while image-guided methods often suffer from semantic inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical image-guided 3D segmentation framework that progressively refines segmentation from instance-level to part-level. Instance segmentation involves rendering a top-view image and projecting SAM-generated masks prompted by YOLO-World back onto the 3D point cloud. Part-level segmentation is subsequently performed by rendering multi-view images of each instance obtained from the previous stage and applying the same 2D segmentation and back-projection process at each view, followed by Bayesian updating fusion to ensure semantic consistency across views. Experiments on real-world factory data demonstrate that our method effectively handles occlusion and structural complexity, achieving consistently high per-class mIoU scores. Additional evaluations on public dataset confirm the generalization ability of our framework, highlighting its robustness, annotation efficiency, and adaptability to diverse 3D environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u76843D\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u5230\u90e8\u4ef6\u7ea7\u9010\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u906e\u6321\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bc6\u96c6\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7269\u4f53\u5bfc\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u73b0\u67093D\u70b9\u4e91\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\uff1a\u6e32\u67d3\u4fef\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u7528YOLO-World\u63d0\u793aSAM\u751f\u6210\u63a9\u7801\u5e76\u53cd\u5411\u6295\u5f71\u52303D\u70b9\u4e91\uff1b2) \u90e8\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\uff1a\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6e32\u67d3\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u76f8\u540c2D\u5206\u5272\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u878d\u5408\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u5382\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6bcf\u7c7bmIoU\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc3D\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u906e\u6321\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u53163D\u73af\u5883\u7684\u80fd\u529b"}}

Despite the effectiveness of self-training techniques in UDA, they struggle to learn each class in a balanced manner due to inherent class imbalance and distribution shift in both data and label space between domains. To address this issue, we propose Balanced Learning for Domain Adaptation (BLDA), a novel approach to directly assess and alleviate class bias without requiring prior knowledge about the distribution shift. First, we identify over-predicted and under-predicted classes by analyzing the distribution of predicted logits. Subsequently, we introduce a post-hoc approach to align the logits distributions across different classes using shared anchor distributions. To further consider the network's need to generate unbiased pseudo-labels during self-training, we estimate logits distributions online and incorporate logits correction terms into the loss function.

Neural Tissue Relation Modeling for Relational Graph Analysis in Non-Melanoma Skin Histology", "comment": "19 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables", "summary": "Histopathology image segmentation is essential for delineating tissue structures in skin cancer diagnostics, but modeling spatial context and inter-tissue relationships remains a challenge, especially in regions with overlapping or morphologically similar tissues. Current convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches operate primarily on visual texture, often treating tissues as independent regions and failing to encode biological context. To this end, we introduce Neural Tissue Relation Modeling (NTRM), a novel segmentation framework that augments CNNs with a tissue-level graph neural network to model spatial and functional relationships across tissue types. NTRM constructs a graph over predicted regions, propagates contextual information via message passing, and refines segmentation through spatial projection. Unlike prior methods, NTRM explicitly encodes inter-tissue dependencies, enabling structurally coherent predictions in boundary-dense zones. On the benchmark Histopathology Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer Segmentation Dataset, NTRM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a robust Dice similarity coefficient that is 4.9\\% to 31.25\\% higher than the best-performing models among the evaluated approaches. Our experiments indicate that relational modeling offers a principled path toward more context-aware and interpretable histological segmentation, compared to local receptive-field architectures that lack tissue-level structural awareness.

Our proposed method replaces the random masking augmentation used in most masked image modelling pretraining methods. The proposed selective masking method selectively masks image patches with the highest reconstruction loss by breaking the image reconstruction pretraining into iterative steps to leverage the trained model's knowledge. We show on two general datasets (Pascal VOC and Cityscapes) and two weed segmentation datasets (Nassar 2020 and Sugarbeets 2016) that our proposed selective masking method outperforms the traditional random masking method and supervised ImageNet pretraining on downstream segmentation accuracy by 2.9% for general datasets and 2.5% for weed segmentation datasets. Furthermore, we found that our selective masking method significantly improves accuracy for the lowest-performing classes. Lastly, we show that using the same pretraining and downstream dataset yields the best result for low-budget self-supervised pretraining.

However, the overpowering generative ability can sometimes hallucinate and thus change the image content despite gaining high visual quality. This type of high-level change can be easily identified by humans yet not well-studied in existing low-level image quality metrics. In this paper, we establish the importance of measuring high-level fidelity for SR models as a complementary criterion to reveal the reliability of generative SR models. We construct the first annotated dataset with fidelity scores from different SR models, and evaluate how state-of-the-art (SOTA) SR models actually perform in preserving high-level fidelity. Based on the dataset, we then analyze how existing image quality metrics correlate with fidelity measurement, and further show that this high-level task can be better addressed by foundation models. Finally, by fine-tuning SR models based on our fidelity feedback, we show that both semantic fidelity and perceptual quality can be improved, demonstrating the potential value of our proposed criteria, both in model evaluation and optimization.

Despite its efficiency, 3DGS suffers from large memory requirements and costly training procedures, motivating efforts toward compression. Existing approaches, however, operate at fixed rates, limiting adaptability to varying bandwidth and device constraints. In this work, we propose a flexible compression scheme for 3DGS that supports interpolation at any rate between predefined bounds.

These applications face common obstacles: features are sparse and weak, backgrounds are cluttered, and object scales vary dramatically. Current transformer-based detectors, while powerful, struggle with three critical issues. First, features degrade severely as networks downsample progressively. Second, spatial convolutions cannot capture long-range dependencies effectively. Third, standard upsampling methods inflate feature maps unnecessarily.\n  We introduce DFIR-DETR to tackle these problems through dynamic feature aggregation combined with frequency-domain processing. Our architecture builds on three novel components. The DCFA module uses dynamic K-sparse attention, cutting complexity from O(N2) down to O(NK), and employs spatial gated linear units for better nonlinear modeling. The DFPN module applies amplitude-normalized upsampling to prevent feature inflation and uses dual-path shuffle convolution to retain spatial details across scales. The FIRC3 module operates in the frequency domain, achieving global receptive fields without sacrificing efficiency.\n  We tested our method extensively on NEU-DET and VisDrone datasets. Results show mAP50 scores of 92.9% and 51.6% respectively-both state-of-the-art. The model stays lightweight with just 11.7M parameters and 41.2 GFLOPs.

While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have extended toward mesh reconstruction and physically-based rendering (PBR), their geometry is still learned from 2D renderings, leading to coarse surfaces and unreliable BRDF-lighting decomposition. To address these limitations, COREA introduces a coarse-to-fine bidirectional 3D-to-3D alignment strategy that allows geometric signals to be learned directly in 3D space. Within this strategy, depth provides coarse alignment between the two representations, while depth gradients and normals refine fine-scale structure, and the resulting geometry supports stable BRDF-lighting decomposition. A density-control mechanism further stabilizes Gaussian growth, balancing geometric fidelity with memory efficiency.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream model, namely Multi-directional Similarity Network (MSN), to accurate and efficient copy-move forgery detection. It addresses the two major limitations of existing deep detection models in \\textbf{representation} and \\textbf{localization}, respectively. In representation, an image is hierarchically encoded by a multi-directional CNN network, and due to the diverse augmentation in scales and rotations, the feature achieved better measures the similarity between sampled patches in two streams. In localization, we design a 2-D similarity matrix based decoder, and compared with the current 1-D similarity vector based one, it makes full use of spatial information in the entire image, leading to the improvement in detecting tampered regions. Beyond the method, a new forgery database generated by various deep neural networks is presented, as a new benchmark for detecting the growing deep-synthesized copy-move.

Existing methods suffer from the discrepancies between the generated clothing results and the target ones, in terms of the patterns, textures and boundaries. Therefore, we propose to use an energy function to impose constraints on the attention map extracted through the generation process. Thus, at each generation step, the attention can be more focused on the clothing region of interest, thereby influencing the generation results to be more consistent with the target clothing details. Furthermore, to address the limitation that existing evaluation metrics concentrate solely on image realism and overlook the alignment with target elements, we design a new metric, Virtual Try-on Inception Distance (VTID), to bridge this gap and ensure a more comprehensive assessment.

Recent advances mitigate this challenge by leveraging region-proposal information to map visual regions with corresponding sentences from lengthy captions, yet incurring notable deployment costs. We introduce MulCLIP, a novel end-to-end multi-level alignment framework that bridges natural long-text structures with image components. MulCLIP first preserves global contrastive alignment between images and both summary and long captions, while extending positional embeddings for longer text sequences. To further enhance fine-grained understanding, we propose two novel strategies: (1) a token reconstruction alignment over locally calibrated features to strengthen semantic connections between words and image patches, and (2) a subcaption-aggregated patch alignment that automatically extracts and aggregates context-rich patches for each subcaption. Experimental results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate our method consistently improves downstream performance, while ablation studies confirm its multi-scale alignment is the key factor driving better fine-grained capability than region-proposal-assisted approaches, making it particularly suitable for diverse real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "MulCLIP\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u5b50\u6807\u9898\u805a\u5408\u8865\u4e01\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7b80\u77ed\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u672c\u3001\u8be6\u7ec6\u63cf\u8ff0\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u8bae\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6620\u5c04\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u957f\u6587\u672c\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "MulCLIP\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6458\u8981\u53ca\u957f\u6807\u9898\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u957f\u6587\u672c\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u6821\u51c6\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u91cd\u5efa\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5355\u8bcd\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u4e01\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u5b50\u6807\u9898\u805a\u5408\u8865\u4e01\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u805a\u5408\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u6807\u9898\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u8865\u4e01\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u9a71\u52a8\u6bd4\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u8bae\u8f85\u52a9\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u597d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "MulCLIP\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CLIP\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Although such approaches improve safety awareness and interpretability, this single-pass think-then-answer paradigm remains vulnerable to contextual or visual jailbreak attacks. This reveals a critical flaw: single-pass reasoning may overlook explicit harmful content in its own output. Our key insight is to exploit this wasted signal through reflection, which can effectively leverage the malicious content revealed in the first-pass reasoning to enable genuine self-correction and prevent unsafe generations. Motivated by this, we propose Think-Reflect-Revise (TRR), a three-stage training framework designed to enhance the safety alignment of LVLMs through policy-guided self-reflection. We first build a Reflective Safety Reasoning (ReSafe) dataset with 5,000 examples that follow a think-reflect-revise process. We then fine-tune the target model using the ReSafe dataset to initialize reflective behavior, and finally reinforce policy-guided reflection through reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that TRR substantially improves the safety performance of LVLMs across both safety-awareness benchmarks and jailbreak attack evaluations, increasing the overall safe response rate from 42.8% to 87.7% on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, while preserving stable performance on general benchmarks such as MMMU and MMStar.

Existing approaches often yield abrupt transitions or over-saturated appearances due to the lack of adaptive structural and semantic alignments. We propose CHIMERA, a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that formulates morphing as a cached inversion-guided denoising process. To handle large semantic and appearance disparities, we propose Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting. Adaptive Cache Injection (ACI) caches down, mid, and up blocks features from both inputs during DDIM inversion and re-injects them adaptively during denoising, enabling spatial and semantic alignment in depth- and time-adaptive manners and enabling natural feature fusion and smooth transitions. Semantic Anchor Prompting (SAP) leverages a vision-language model to generate a shared anchor prompt that serves as a semantic anchor, bridging dissimilar inputs and guiding the denoising process toward coherent results. Finally, we introduce the Global-Local Consistency Score (GLCS), a morphing-oriented metric that simultaneously evaluates the global harmonization of the two inputs and the smoothness of the local morphing transition. Extensive experiments and user studies show that CHIMERA achieves smoother and more semantically aligned transitions than existing methods, establishing a new state of the art in image morphing.

While recent pose-free feed-forward methods leveraging pre-trained 3D priors have achieved impressive results, most of them rely on full fine-tuning of large Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones and incur substantial GPU costs. In this work, we introduce MuSASplat, a novel framework that dramatically reduces the computational burden of training pose-free feed-forward 3D Gaussian splats models with little compromise of rendering quality. Central to our approach is a lightweight Multi-Scale Adapter that enables efficient fine-tuning of ViT-based architectures with only a small fraction of training parameters. This design avoids the prohibitive GPU overhead associated with previous full-model adaptation techniques while maintaining high fidelity in novel view synthesis, even with very sparse input views. In addition, we introduce a Feature Fusion Aggregator that integrates features across input views effectively and efficiently. Unlike widely adopted memory banks, the Feature Fusion Aggregator ensures consistent geometric integration across input views and meanwhile mitigates the memory usage, training complexity, and computational costs significantly.

We first bridge this research gap by contributing the SPPE (Surrogate Privacy Protected Editable) dataset, which includes a wide range of privacy categories and user instructions to simulate real MLLM applications. This dataset offers protected surrogates alongside their various MLLM-edited versions, thus enabling the direct assessment of privacy recovery quality. By formulating privacy recovery as a guided generation task conditioned on complementary multimodal signals, we further introduce a unified approach that reliably reconstructs private content while preserving the fidelity of MLLM-generated edits.

Existing methods typically apply uniform restoration strategies across the entire image, struggling to handle multiple co-occurring degradations that vary spatially and with water conditions. We introduce TIDE, a $\\underline{t}$wo stage $\\underline{i}$nverse $\\underline{d}$egradation $\\underline{e}$stimation framework that explicitly models degradation characteristics and applies targeted restoration through specialized prior decomposition. Our approach disentangles the restoration process into multiple specialized hypotheses that are adaptively fused based on local degradation patterns, followed by a progressive refinement stage that corrects residual artifacts. Specifically, TIDE decomposes underwater degradations into four key factors, namely color distortion, haze, detail loss, and noise, and designs restoration experts specialized for each. By generating specialized restoration hypotheses, TIDE balances competing degradation factors and produces natural results even in highly degraded regions. Extensive experiments across both standard benchmarks and challenging turbid water conditions show that TIDE achieves competitive performance on reference based fidelity metrics while outperforming state of the art methods on non reference perceptual quality metrics, with strong improvements in color correction and contrast enhancement.

Chen"], "title": "Integrating Multi-scale and Multi-filtration Topological Features for Medical Image Classification", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern deep neural networks have shown remarkable performance in medical image classification. However, such networks either emphasize pixel-intensity features instead of fundamental anatomical structures (e.g., those encoded by topological invariants), or they capture only simple topological features via single-parameter persistence. In this paper, we propose a new topology-guided classification framework that extracts multi-scale and multi-filtration persistent topological features and integrates them into vision classification backbones. For an input image, we first compute cubical persistence diagrams (PDs) across multiple image resolutions/scales. We then develop a ``vineyard'' algorithm that consolidates these PDs into a single, stable diagram capturing signatures at varying granularities, from global anatomy to subtle local irregularities that may indicate early-stage disease. To further exploit richer topological representations produced by multiple filtrations, we design a cross-attention-based neural network that directly processes the consolidated final PDs.

Traditional level set methods, while effective in certain cases, often depend on approximate bias field estimations and therefore struggle under severe non-uniform imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel variational Reflectance-based Level Set Model (RefLSM), which explicitly integrates Retinex-inspired reflectance decomposition into the segmentation framework. By decomposing the observed image into reflectance and bias field components, RefLSM directly segments the reflectance, which is invariant to illumination and preserves fine structural details. Building on this foundation, we introduce two key innovations for enhanced precision and robustness. First, a linear structural prior steers the smoothed reflectance gradients toward a data-driven reference, providing reliable geometric guidance in noisy or low-contrast scenes. Second, a relaxed binary level-set is embedded in RefLSM and enforced via convex relaxation and sign projection, yielding stable evolution and avoiding reinitialization-induced diffusion. The resulting variational problem is solved efficiently using an ADMM-based optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrate that RefLSM achieves superior segmentation accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art level set methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRefLSM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06Retinex\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u878d\u5165\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u5206\u5272\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u5149\u7167\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u677e\u5f1b\u4e8c\u503c\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u9762\u4e34\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd1\u4f3c\u504f\u7f6e\u573a\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u6a21\u578b(RefLSM)\uff0c\u5c06\u89c2\u5bdf\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u548c\u504f\u7f6e\u573a\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u5272\u5149\u7167\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc\u5e73\u6ed1\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u677e\u5f1b\u4e8c\u503c\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u65b0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ADMM\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u6c42\u89e3\u53d8\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRefLSM\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RefLSM\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408Retinex\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u7167\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5272\u3002"}}

However, these methods typically estimate the entropy of VQ indices using a static, global probability distribution, which fails to adapt to the specific content of each image. This non-adaptive approach leads to untapped bitrate potential and challenges in achieving flexible rate control. To address this challenge, we introduce a Controllable Generative Image Compression framework based on a VQ Hyperprior, termed HVQ-CGIC. HVQ-CGIC rigorously derives the mathematical foundation for introducing a hyperprior to the VQ indices entropy model. Based on this foundation, through novel loss design, to our knowledge, this framework is the first to introduce RD balance and control into vector quantization-based Generative Image Compression. Cooperating with a lightweight hyper-prior estimation network, HVQ-CGIC achieves a significant advantage in rate-distortion (RD) performance compared to current state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative compression methods. On the Kodak dataset, we achieve the same LPIPS as Control-GIC, CDC and HiFiC with an average of 61.3% fewer bits.

However, its practical use is hindered by the massive memory and computational demands required to store and render millions of Gaussians. These challenges become even more severe in 4D dynamic scenes. To address these issues, the field of Efficient Gaussian Splatting has rapidly evolved, proposing methods that reduce redundancy while preserving reconstruction quality. This survey provides the first unified overview of efficient 3D and 4D Gaussian Splatting techniques.

Zhu"], "title": "Generating Storytelling Images with Rich Chains-of-Reasoning", "comment": null, "summary": "An image can convey a compelling story by presenting rich, logically connected visual clues. These connections form Chains-of-Reasoning (CoRs) within the image, enabling viewers to infer events, causal relationships, and other information, thereby understanding the underlying story. In this paper, we focus on these semantically rich images and define them as Storytelling Images. Such images have diverse applications beyond illustration creation and cognitive screening, leveraging their ability to convey multi-layered information visually and inspire active interpretation. However, due to their complex semantic nature, Storytelling Images are inherently challenging to create, and thus remain relatively scarce. To address this challenge, we introduce the Storytelling Image Generation task, which explores how generative AI models can be leveraged to create such images. Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline, StorytellingPainter, which combines the creative reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the visual synthesis capabilities of Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate Storytelling Images. Alongside this pipeline, we develop a dedicated evaluation framework comprising three main evaluators: a Semantic Complexity Evaluator, a KNN-based Diversity Evaluator and a Story-Image Alignment Evaluator. Given the critical role of story generation in the Storytelling Image Generation task and the performance disparity between open-source and proprietary LLMs, we further explore tailored training strategies to reduce this gap, resulting in a series of lightweight yet effective models named Mini-Storytellers. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approaches.

We introduce MMRPT, a masked multimodal reinforcement pre-training framework that strengthens visual reasoning in MLLMs. We are the first to incorporate reinforcement learning directly into the pre-training of large vision-language models, enabling learning signals that reward visual grounding rather than caption imitation. MMRPT constructs masked multimodal data by estimating sentence-level visual dependency via attention over visual tokens and masking highly vision-dependent segments; the model reconstructs these spans through vision-grounded reasoning guided by a semantic-visual reward. Experiments show consistent zero-shot gains across diverse benchmarks and substantially improved robustness under supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating that reinforcement-driven masked reasoning provides a more reliable and generalizable pre-training objective for multimodal models.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMRPT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u800c\u975e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u4eff\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf-\u63cf\u8ff0\u5bf9\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\u7ebf\u7d22\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5f3a\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9token\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f30\u8ba1\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u63a9\u7801\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u4e49-\u89c6\u89c9\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u91cd\u5efa\u88ab\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b3) \u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76f4\u63a5\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1) \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b2) \u5728\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b3) \u8bc1\u660e\u5f3a\u5316\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "MMRPT\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u800c\u975e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u4eff\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Methods: The AutoLugano system processes baseline FDG-PET/CT scans through three sequential modules:(1) Anatomy-Informed Lesion Segmentation, a 3D nnU-Net model, trained on multi-channel inputs, performs automated lesion detection (2) Atlas-based Anatomical Localization, which leverages the TotalSegmentator toolkit to map segmented lesions to 21 predefined lymph node regions using deterministic anatomical rules; and (3) Automated Lugano Staging, where the spatial distribution of involved regions is translated into Lugano stages and therapeutic groups (Limited vs. Advanced Stage).The system was trained on the public autoPET dataset (n=1,007) and externally validated on an independent cohort of 67 patients. Performance was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-scorefor regional involvement detection and staging agreement. Results: On the external validation set, the proposed model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.31%, sensitivity of 74.47%, Specificity of 94.21% and an F1-score of 80.80% for regional involvement detection,outperforming baseline models. Most notably, for the critical clinical task of therapeutic stratification (Limited vs. Advanced Stage), the system achieved a high accuracy of 85.07%, with a specificity of 90.48% and a sensitivity of 82.61%.Conclusion: AutoLugano represents the first fully automated, end-to-end pipeline that translates a single baseline FDG-PET/CT scan into a complete Lugano stage.

To appear in the proceedings published by IOS Press (DOI: 10.3233/FAIA413)", "summary": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) faces the challenge of categorizing unlabeled data containing both known and novel classes, given only labels for known classes. Previous studies often treat each class independently, neglecting the inherent inter-class relations. Obtaining such inter-class relations directly presents a significant challenge in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose ReLKD, an end-to-end framework that effectively exploits implicit inter-class relations and leverages this knowledge to enhance the classification of novel classes. ReLKD comprises three key modules: a target-grained module for learning discriminative representations, a coarse-grained module for capturing hierarchical class relations, and a distillation module for transferring knowledge from the coarse-grained module to refine the target-grained module's representation learning. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLKD, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data.

Our method treats text and non-text regions separately, refining text regions first and merging them with non-text regions later for full-scene optimization. STRinGS produces sharp, readable text even in challenging configurations. We introduce a text readability measure OCR Character Error Rate (CER) to evaluate the efficacy on text regions. STRinGS results in a 63.6% relative improvement over 3DGS at just 7K iterations. We also introduce a curated dataset STRinGS-360 with diverse text scenarios to evaluate text readability in 3D reconstruction.

However, existing camera encoding methods often rely on simplified pinhole assumptions, restricting generalization across the diverse intrinsics and lens distortions in real-world cameras. We introduce Relative Ray Encoding, a geometry-consistent representation that unifies complete camera information, including 6-DoF poses, intrinsics, and lens distortions. To evaluate its capability under diverse controllability demands, we adopt camera-controlled text-to-video generation as a testbed task. Within this setting, we further identify pitch and roll as two components effective for Absolute Orientation Encoding, enabling full control over the initial camera orientation. Together, these designs form UCPE (Unified Camera Positional Encoding), which integrates into a pretrained video Diffusion Transformer through a lightweight spatial attention adapter, adding less than 1% trainable parameters while achieving state-of-the-art camera controllability and visual fidelity. To facilitate systematic training and evaluation, we construct a large video dataset covering a wide range of camera motions and lens types. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of UCPE in camera-controllable video generation and highlight its potential as a general camera representation for Transformers across future multi-view, video, and 3D tasks.

Even with the promotion of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the process of tumor delineation is difficult and time-consuming, which is prone to inter-observer error. In order to overcome these limitations, this work proposes a hybrid deep learning model based on SqueezeNet v1 which is a lightweight model, and EfficientNet-B0, which is a high-performing model, and is enhanced with handcrafted radiomic descriptors, including Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gabor filters and Wavelet transforms. The framework was trained and tested only on publicly available Nickparvar Brain Tumor MRI dataset, which consisted of 7,023 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted axial MRI slices which were categorized into four groups: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The testing accuracy of the model was 98.93% that reached a level of 99.08% with Test Time Augmentation (TTA) showing great generalization and power. The proposed hybrid network offers a compromise between computation efficiency and diagnostic accuracy compared to current deep learning structures and only has to be trained using fewer than 2.1 million parameters and less than 1.2 GFLOPs.

We propose TEXTER, which overcomes this limitation by isolating decision-critical features before alignment. TEXTER identifies the neurons contributing to the prediction and emphasizes the features encoded in those neurons -- i.e., the decision-critical features. It then maps these emphasized features into the CLIP feature space to retrieve textual explanations that reflect the model's reasoning. A sparse autoencoder further improves interpretability, particularly for Transformer architectures. Extensive experiments show that TEXTER generates more faithful and interpretable explanations than existing methods.

However, it also exposes these assets to serious risks of unauthorized editing and malicious tampering. Although imperceptible adversarial perturbations against diffusion models have proven effective for protecting 2D images, applying them to 3DGS encounters two major challenges: view-generalizable protection and balancing invisibility with protection capability. In this work, we propose the first editing safeguard for 3DGS, termed AdLift, which prevents instruction-driven editing across arbitrary views and dimensions by lifting strictly bounded 2D adversarial perturbations into 3D Gaussian-represented safeguard. To ensure both adversarial perturbations effectiveness and invisibility, these safeguard Gaussians are progressively optimized across training views using a tailored Lifted PGD, which first conducts gradient truncation during back-propagation from the editing model at the rendered image and applies projected gradients to strictly constrain the image-level perturbation. Then, the resulting perturbation is backpropagated to the safeguard Gaussian parameters via an image-to-Gaussian fitting operation. We alternate between gradient truncation and image-to-Gaussian fitting, yielding consistent adversarial-based protection performance across different viewpoints and generalizes to novel views. Empirically, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that AdLift effectively protects against state-of-the-art instruction-driven 2D image and 3DGS editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdLift\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e25\u683c\u6709\u754c\u76842D\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a3D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u4efb\u610f\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a82D\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6269\u5c55\u52303DGS\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e863D\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u4f7f3DGS\u8d44\u4ea7\u9762\u4e34\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u6076\u610f\u7be1\u6539\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u67092D\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e3DGS\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u89c6\u89d2\u6cdb\u5316\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4e0e\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdLift\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u4e25\u683c\u6709\u754c\u76842D\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a3D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u7684Lifted PGD\u8fdb\u884c\u6e10\u8fdb\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89d2\u95f4\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u68af\u5ea6\u622a\u65ad\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u62df\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAdLift\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a82D\u56fe\u50cf\u548c3DGS\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "AdLift\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf93DGS\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89d2\u6cdb\u5316\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u53ef\u89c1\u6027-\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a3DGS\u8d44\u4ea7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u3002"}}

In medical imaging, it can support clinical decision-making, but current models often over-edit. This can distort organs, create false findings, and miss small tumors because these models do not understand anatomy or contrast dynamics. We propose SMILE, an anatomy-aware diffusion model that learns how organs are shaped and how they take up contrast. It enhances only clinically relevant regions while leaving all other areas unchanged. SMILE introduces three key ideas: (1) structure-aware supervision that follows true organ boundaries and contrast patterns; (2) registration-free learning that works directly with unaligned multi-phase CT scans; (3) unified inference that provides fast and consistent enhancement across all contrast phases. Across six external datasets, SMILE outperforms existing methods in image quality (14.2% higher SSIM, 20.6% higher PSNR, 50% better FID) and in clinical usefulness by producing anatomically accurate and diagnostically meaningful images. SMILE also improves cancer detection from non-contrast CT, raising the F1 score by up to 10 percent.", "AI": {"tldr": "SMILE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u5256\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b83\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u5b98\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u6444\u53d6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ea\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u800c\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u5176\u4ed6\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5668\u5b98\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u4ea7\u751f\u865a\u5047\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u9057\u6f0f\u5c0f\u80bf\u7624\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0d\u7406\u89e3\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSMILE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a(1)\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u771f\u5b9e\u5668\u5b98\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b(2)\u65e0\u9700\u914d\u51c6\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u591a\u671f\u76f8CT\u626b\u63cf\uff1b(3)\u7edf\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5bf9\u6bd4\u671f\u76f8\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSMILE\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SSIM\u63d0\u9ad814.2%\uff0cPSNR\u63d0\u9ad820.6%\uff0cFID\u6539\u558450%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u89e3\u5256\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u975e\u5bf9\u6bd4CT\u7684\u764c\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe10%\u3002", "conclusion": "SMILE\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u5256\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u5256\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u764c\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose a three-stage **r**einforcing **v**ision-**l**anguage **f**ramework (**RVLF**). We build a large vision-language model (LVLM) specifically designed for sign language, and then combine it with reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively enhance translation performance. First, for a sufficient representation of sign language, RVLF introduces an effective semantic representation learning mechanism that fuses skeleton-based motion cues with semantically rich visual features extracted via DINOv2, followed by instruction tuning to obtain a strong SLT-SFT baseline. Then, to improve sentence-level semantic misalignment, we introduce a GRPO-based optimization strategy that fine-tunes the SLT-SFT model with a reward function combining translation fidelity (BLEU) and sentence completeness (ROUGE), yielding the optimized model termed SLT-GRPO. Our conceptually simple framework yields substantial gains under the gloss-free SLT setting without pre-training on any external large-scale sign language datasets, improving BLEU-4 scores by +5.1, +1.11, +1.4, and +1.61 on the CSL-Daily, PHOENIX-2014T, How2Sign, and OpenASL datasets, respectively.

Camera-ready-based version with minor edits for readability (no change in the contents)", "summary": "Three-dimensional geospatial analysis is critical to applications in urban planning, climate adaptation, and environmental assessment. Current methodologies depend on costly, specialized sensors (e.g., LiDAR and multispectral), which restrict global accessibility. Existing sensor-based and rule-driven methods further struggle with tasks requiring the integration of multiple 3D cues, handling diverse queries, and providing interpretable reasoning. We hereby present Geo3DVQA, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in height-aware, 3D geospatial reasoning using RGB-only remote sensing imagery. Unlike conventional sensor-based frameworks, Geo3DVQA emphasizes realistic scenarios that integrate elevation, sky view factors, and land cover patterns. The benchmark encompasses 110k curated question-answer pairs spanning 16 task categories across three complexity levels: single-feature inference, multi-feature reasoning, and application-level spatial analysis. The evaluation of ten state-of-the-art VLMs highlights the difficulty of RGB-to-3D reasoning. GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash achieved only 28.6% and 33.0% accuracy respectively, while domain-specific fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B achieved 49.6% (+24.8 points).

However, recent observations suggest ViTs often spontaneously manifest a \"U-shaped\" entropy profile-compressing information in middle layers before expanding it for the final classification. In this work, we demonstrate that this \"Inductive Bottleneck\" is not an architectural artifact, but a data-dependent adaptation. By analyzing the layer-wise Effective Encoding Dimension (EED) of DINO-trained ViTs across datasets of varying compositional complexity (UC Merced, Tiny ImageNet, and CIFAR-100), we show that the depth of the bottleneck correlates strongly with the semantic abstraction required by the task.

Considering aerial imagery (e.g., modern aerial photos collected through drones, historical photos from aerial archives, high-resolution satellite imagery, etc.) presents unique challenges because spatial resolution varies widely across datasets, the use of color is not consistent, targets often shrink to only a few pixels, and scenes contain very high object densities and objects with partial occlusions. This work presents Aerial-D, a new large-scale referring expression segmentation dataset for aerial imagery, comprising 37,288 images with 1,522,523 referring expressions that cover 259,709 annotated targets, spanning across individual object instances, groups of instances, and semantic regions covering 21 distinct classes that range from vehicles and infrastructure to land coverage types. The dataset was constructed through a fully automatic pipeline that combines systematic rule-based expression generation with a Large Language Model (LLM) enhancement procedure that enriched both the linguistic variety and the focus on visual details within the referring expressions. Filters were additionally used to simulate historic imaging conditions for each scene. We adopted the RSRefSeg architecture, and trained models on Aerial-D together with prior aerial datasets, yielding unified instance and semantic segmentation from text for both modern and historical images. Results show that the combined training achieves competitive performance on contemporary benchmarks, while maintaining strong accuracy under monochrome, sepia, and grainy degradations that appear in archival aerial photography.

However, T2I models exhibit limitations resulting from prior view bias, which produces conflicting appearances between different views of an object. This bias causes subject-words to preferentially activate prior view features during cross-attention (CA) computation, regardless of the target view condition. To overcome this limitation, we conduct a comprehensive mathematical analysis to reveal the root cause of the prior view bias in T2I models. Moreover, we find different UNet layers show different effects of prior view in CA. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, TD-Attn, which addresses multi-view inconsistency via two key components: (1) the 3D-Aware Attention Guidance Module (3D-AAG) constructs a view-consistent 3D attention Gaussian for subject-words to enforce spatial consistency across attention-focused regions, thereby compensating for the limited spatial information in 2D individual view CA maps; (2) the Hierarchical Attention Modulation Module (HAM) utilizes a Semantic Guidance Tree (SGT) to direct the Semantic Response Profiler (SRP) in localizing and modulating CA layers that are highly responsive to view conditions, where the enhanced CA maps further support the construction of more consistent 3D attention Gaussians. Notably, HAM facilitates semantic-specific interventions, enabling controllable and precise 3D editing. Extensive experiments firmly establish that TD-Attn has the potential to serve as a universal plugin, significantly enhancing multi-view consistency across 3D tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "TD-Attn\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u51b3T2I\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5148\u9a8c\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8c03\u5236\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u63d2\u4ef6\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd3D\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u76843D\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u95f4\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u4f7f\u5f97\u4e3b\u4f53\u8bcd\u5728\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u4f18\u5148\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5148\u9a8c\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTD-Attn\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) 3D\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2) \u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8c03\u5236\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u6811\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u5668\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8c03\u5236\u5bf9\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTD-Attn\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u63d2\u4ef6\u589e\u5f3a\u5404\u79cd3D\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "TD-Attn\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86T2I\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5148\u9a8c\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study of MICo, categorizing it into 7 representative tasks and curate a large-scale collection of high-quality source images and construct diverse MICo prompts. Leveraging powerful proprietary models, we synthesize a rich amount of balanced composite images, followed by human-in-the-loop filtering and refinement, resulting in MICo-150K, a comprehensive dataset for MICo with identity consistency. We further build a Decomposition-and-Recomposition (De&Re) subset, where 11K real-world complex images are decomposed into components and recomposed, enabling both real and synthetic compositions. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we construct MICo-Bench with 100 cases per task and 300 challenging De&Re cases, and further introduce a new metric, Weighted-Ref-VIEScore, specifically tailored for MICo evaluation. Finally, we fine-tune multiple models on MICo-150K and evaluate them on MICo-Bench. The results show that MICo-150K effectively equips models without MICo capability and further enhances those with existing skills. Notably, our baseline model, Qwen-MICo, fine-tuned from Qwen-Image-Edit, matches Qwen-Image-2509 in 3-image composition while supporting arbitrary multi-image inputs beyond the latter's limitation.

Current approaches for detecting small objects in aerial images often involve image cropping and modifications to detector network architectures. Techniques such as sliding window cropping and architectural enhancements, including higher-resolution feature maps and attention mechanisms, are commonly employed. Given the growing importance of aerial imagery in various critical and industrial applications, the need for robust frameworks for small object detection becomes imperative. To address this need, we adopted the base SW-YOLO approach to enhance speed and accuracy in small object detection by refining cropping dimensions and overlap in sliding window usage and subsequently enhanced it through architectural modifications. we propose a novel model by modifying the base model architecture, including advanced feature extraction modules in the neck for feature map enhancement, integrating CBAM in the backbone to preserve spatial and channel information, and introducing a new head to boost small object detection accuracy. Finally, we compared our method with SAHI, one of the most powerful frameworks for processing large-scale images, and CZDet, which is also based on image cropping, achieving significant improvements in accuracy. The proposed model achieves significant accuracy gains on the VisDrone2019 dataset, outperforming baseline YOLOv5L detection by a substantial margin.

Composing concepts using a set of logic operators enables the model to capture inter-concept relations, while simultaneously improving the expressivity of the model in terms of logic operations.

A Million-Scale Benchmark and New Baseline", "comment": "https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking", "summary": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer wide-ranging applications but also pose significant safety and privacy violation risks in areas like airport and infrastructure inspection, spurring the rapid development of Anti-UAV technologies in recent years. However, current Anti-UAV research primarily focuses on RGB, infrared (IR), or RGB-IR videos captured by fixed ground cameras, with little attention to tracking target UAVs from another moving UAV platform. To fill this gap, we propose a new multi-modal visual tracking task termed UAV-Anti-UAV, which involves a pursuer UAV tracking a target adversarial UAV in the video stream. Compared to existing Anti-UAV tasks, UAV-Anti-UAV is more challenging due to severe dual-dynamic disturbances caused by the rapid motion of both the capturing platform and the target. To advance research in this domain, we construct a million-scale dataset consisting of 1,810 videos, each manually annotated with bounding boxes, a language prompt, and 15 tracking attributes. Furthermore, we propose MambaSTS, a Mamba-based baseline method for UAV-Anti-UAV tracking, which enables integrated spatial-temporal-semantic learning. Specifically, we employ Mamba and Transformer models to learn global semantic and spatial features, respectively, and leverage the state space model's strength in long-sequence modeling to establish video-level long-term context via a temporal token propagation mechanism. We conduct experiments on the UAV-Anti-UAV dataset to validate the effectiveness of our method.

While many recent works seek to enhance CNNs with global contextual understanding via self-attention-based Vision Transformers, these approaches often introduce significant computational overhead. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to retain strong global perception without relying on computationally expensive components. We present GlimmerNet, an ultra-lightweight convolutional network built on the principle of separating receptive field diversity from feature recombination. GlimmerNet introduces Grouped Dilated Depthwise Convolutions(GDBlocks), which partition channels into groups with distinct dilation rates, enabling multi-scale feature extraction at no additional parameter cost. To fuse these features efficiently, we design a novel Aggregator module that recombines cross-group representations using grouped pointwise convolution, significantly lowering parameter overhead. With just 31K parameters and 29% fewer FLOPs than the most recent baseline, GlimmerNet achieves a new state-of-the-art weighted F1-score of 0.966 on the UAV-focused AIDERv2 dataset.

We first define the Hand Interaction Timeline (HIT) from a rigid object's perspective. In a HIT, an object is first static relative to the scene, then is held in hand following contact, where its pose changes. This is usually followed by a firm grip during use, before it is released to be static again w.r.t. to the scene. We model these pose constraints over the HIT, and propose to propagate the object's pose along the HIT enabling superior reconstruction using our proposed Constrained Optimisation and Propagation (COP) framework. Importantly, we focus on timelines with stable grasps - i.e. where the hand is stably holding an object, effectively maintaining constant contact during use. This allows us to efficiently annotate, study, and evaluate object reconstruction in videos without 3D ground truth. We evaluate our proposed task, ROHIT, over two egocentric datasets, HOT3D and in-the-wild EPIC-Kitchens. In HOT3D, we curate 1.2K clips of stable grasps. In EPIC-Kitchens, we annotate 2.4K clips of stable grasps including 390 object instances across 9 categories from videos of daily interactions in 141 environments. Without 3D ground truth, we utilise 2D projection error to assess the reconstruction.

However, existing methods are largely confined to single-agent scenarios, overlooking the physically plausible interplay essential for multi-agent interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose InterAgent, the first end-to-end framework for text-driven physics-based multi-agent humanoid control. At its core, we introduce an autoregressive diffusion transformer equipped with multi-stream blocks, which decouples proprioception, exteroception, and action to mitigate cross-modal interference while enabling synergistic coordination. We further propose a novel interaction graph exteroception representation that explicitly captures fine-grained joint-to-joint spatial dependencies to facilitate network learning. Additionally, within it we devise a sparse edge-based attention mechanism that dynamically prunes redundant connections and emphasizes critical inter-agent spatial relations, thereby enhancing the robustness of interaction modeling.

To resolve this conflict, we propose VideoCoF, a novel Chain-of-Frames approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VideoCoF enforces a ``see, reason, then edit\" procedure by compelling the video diffusion model to first predict reasoning tokens (edit-region latents) before generating the target video tokens. This explicit reasoning step removes the need for user-provided masks while achieving precise instruction-to-region alignment and fine-grained video editing. Furthermore, we introduce a RoPE alignment strategy that leverages these reasoning tokens to ensure motion alignment and enable length extrapolation beyond the training duration. We demonstrate that with a minimal data cost of only 50k video pairs, VideoCoF achieves state-of-the-art performance on VideoCoF-Bench, validating the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.

Some NVCs incorporate perceptual or adversarial objectives but still suffer from artifacts due to limited generation capacity, whereas others leverage pretrained diffusion models to improve quality at the cost of heavy sampling complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose S2VC, a Single-Step diffusion based Video Codec that integrates a conditional coding framework with an efficient single-step diffusion generator, enabling realistic reconstruction at low bitrates with reduced sampling cost. Recognizing the importance of semantic conditioning in single-step diffusion, we introduce Contextual Semantic Guidance to extract frame-adaptive semantics from buffered features. It replaces text captions with efficient, fine-grained conditioning, thereby improving generation realism. In addition, Temporal Consistency Guidance is incorporated into the diffusion U-Net to enforce temporal coherence across frames and ensure stable generation.

Most existing detectors implicitly assume temporally consistent and clean facial sequences, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world scenarios where compression artifacts, occlusions, and adversarial attacks destabilize face detection and often lead to invalid or misdetected faces. To address these challenges, we propose a Laplacian-Regularized Graph Convolutional Network (LR-GCN) that robustly detects DeepFakes from noisy or unordered face sequences, while being trained only on clean facial data. Our method constructs an Order-Free Temporal Graph Embedding (OF-TGE) that organizes frame-wise CNN features into an adaptive sparse graph based on semantic affinities. Unlike traditional methods constrained by strict temporal continuity, OF-TGE captures intrinsic feature consistency across frames, making it resilient to shuffled, missing, or heavily corrupted inputs. We further impose a dual-level sparsity mechanism on both graph structure and node features to suppress the influence of invalid faces. Crucially, we introduce an explicit Graph Laplacian Spectral Prior that acts as a high-pass operator in the graph spectral domain, highlighting structural anomalies and forgery artifacts, which are then consolidated by a low-pass GCN aggregation. This sequential design effectively realizes a task-driven spectral band-pass mechanism that suppresses background information and random noise while preserving manipulation cues.

Dataset and code: https://github.com/RyotaOkumura/ControlVP", "summary": "Recent text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have achieved impressive visual quality, yet they often suffer from geometric inconsistencies that undermine the structural realism of generated scenes. One prominent issue is vanishing point inconsistency, where projections of parallel lines fail to converge correctly in 2D space. This leads to structurally implausible geometry that degrades spatial realism, especially in architectural scenes. We propose ControlVP, a user-guided framework for correcting vanishing point inconsistencies in generated images. Our approach extends a pre-trained diffusion model by incorporating structural guidance derived from building contours. We also introduce geometric constraints that explicitly encourage alignment between image edges and perspective cues.

This requires inferring nearly $90^\\circ$ viewpoint gaps from image sources with severely foreshortened facades and flawed textures, causing state-of-the-art reconstruction engines such as NeRF and 3DGS to fail.\n  To address this problem, we propose two design choices tailored for city structures and satellite inputs. First, we model city geometry as a 2.5D height map, implemented as a Z-monotonic signed distance field (SDF) that matches urban building layouts from top-down viewpoints. This stabilizes geometry optimization under sparse, off-nadir satellite views and yields a watertight mesh with crisp roofs and clean, vertically extruded facades. Second, we paint the mesh appearance from satellite images via differentiable rendering techniques. While the satellite inputs may contain long-range, blurry captures, we further train a generative texture restoration network to enhance the appearance, recovering high-frequency, plausible texture details from degraded inputs.\n  Our method's scalability and robustness are demonstrated through extensive experiments on large-scale urban reconstruction. For example, in our teaser figure, we reconstruct a $4\\,\\mathrm{km}^2$ real-world region from only a few satellite images, achieving state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing photorealistic ground views.

Demystifying Token Pruning in VLLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) incur high computational costs due to their reliance on hundreds of visual tokens to represent images. While token pruning offers a promising solution for accelerating inference, this paper, however, identifies a key observation: in deeper layers (e.g., beyond the 20th), existing training-free pruning methods perform no better than random pruning. We hypothesize that this degradation is caused by \"vanishing token information\", where visual tokens progressively lose their salience with increasing network depth. To validate this hypothesis, we quantify a token's information content by measuring the change in the model output probabilities upon its removal. Using this proposed metric, our analysis of the information of visual tokens across layers reveals three key findings: (1) As layers deepen, the information of visual tokens gradually becomes uniform and eventually vanishes at an intermediate layer, which we term as \"information horizon\", beyond which the visual tokens become redundant; (2) The position of this horizon is not static; it extends deeper for visually intensive tasks, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), compared to more general tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA); (3) This horizon is also strongly correlated with model capacity, as stronger VLLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL) employ deeper visual tokens than weaker models (e.g., LLaVA-1.5). Based on our findings, we show that simple random pruning in deep layers efficiently balances performance and efficiency. Moreover, integrating random pruning consistently enhances existing methods. Using DivPrune with random pruning achieves state-of-the-art results, maintaining 96.9% of Qwen-2.5-VL-7B performance while pruning 50% of visual tokens.

This strategy establishes the model as a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), delivering superior text-rendering capabilities and remarkable photorealism, and significantly enhancing aesthetic quality. 2) Notably, it sets a new industry standard for Chinese character rendering. By supporting even complex and rare characters, it outperforms both major open-source and commercial solutions in coverage, while also achieving superior accuracy. 3) The model achieves remarkable efficiency through its compact design. With a core diffusion model of only 6B parameters, it is significantly smaller than the nearly 20B or larger Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures common in the field. This ensures minimal VRAM usage and rapid inference, significantly reducing deployment costs. Beyond generation, LongCat-Image also excels in image editing, achieving SOTA results on standard benchmarks with superior editing consistency compared to other open-source works. 4) To fully empower the community, we have established the most comprehensive open-source ecosystem to date. We are releasing not only multiple model versions for text-to-image and image editing, including checkpoints after mid-training and post-training stages, but also the entire toolchain of training procedure.

SAM 3 supports zero-shot segmentation across a wide range of prompts, including point, bounding box, and language-based prompts, allowing for more flexible and intuitive interactions with the model. In this empirical evaluation, we assess the performance of SAM 3 in robot-assisted surgery, benchmarking its zero-shot segmentation with point and bounding box prompts and exploring its effectiveness in dynamic video tracking, alongside its newly introduced language prompt segmentation. While language prompts show potential, their performance in the surgical domain is currently suboptimal, highlighting the need for further domain-specific training. Additionally, we investigate SAM 3's 3D reconstruction abilities, demonstrating its capacity to process surgical scene data and reconstruct 3D anatomical structures from 2D images. Through comprehensive testing on the MICCAI EndoVis 2017 and EndoVis 2018 benchmarks, SAM 3 shows clear improvements over SAM and SAM 2 in both image and video segmentation under spatial prompts, while zero-shot evaluations on SCARED, StereoMIS, and EndoNeRF indicate strong monocular depth estimation and realistic 3D instrument reconstruction, yet also reveal remaining limitations in complex, highly dynamic surgical scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAM 3\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u4f18\u4e8e\u524d\u4ee3\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u624b\u672f\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30SAM 3\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u70b9\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca3D\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027", "method": "\u5728MICCAI EndoVis 2017\u548c2018\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30SAM 3\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5728SCARED\u3001StereoMIS\u548cEndoNeRF\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c3D\u5668\u68b0\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b", "result": "SAM 3\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8eSAM\u548cSAM 2\uff1b\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u624b\u672f\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b3D\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "conclusion": "SAM 3\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\uff0c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u524d\u666f\u4f46\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u624b\u672f\u73af\u5883"}}

Recent advancements employ predefined object queries to aggregate semantic information from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) outputs that are lifted into 3D point clouds, facilitating spatial information propagation through inter-query interactions. Nevertheless, perception is an inherently dynamic process, rendering temporal understanding a critical yet overlooked dimension within these prevailing query-based pipelines. Therefore, to further unlock the temporal environmental perception capabilities of embodied agents, our work reconceptualizes online 3D segmentation as an instance tracking problem (AutoSeg3D). Our core strategy involves utilizing object queries for temporal information propagation, where long-term instance association promotes the coherence of features and object identities, while short-term instance update enriches instant observations. Given that viewpoint variations in embodied robotics often lead to partial object visibility across frames, this mechanism aids the model in developing a holistic object understanding beyond incomplete instantaneous views. Furthermore, we introduce spatial consistency learning to mitigate the fragmentation problem inherent in VFMs, yielding more comprehensive instance information for enhancing the efficacy of both long-term and short-term temporal learning. The temporal information exchange and consistency learning facilitated by these sparse object queries not only enhance spatial comprehension but also circumvent the computational burden associated with dense temporal point cloud interactions.

While most prior work has focused on selecting informative images for classification tasks, we investigate the more challenging setting of dense prediction, where annotations are more costly and time-intensive, especially in medical imaging. Region-level annotation has been shown to be more efficient than image-level annotation for these tasks. However, existing methods for representative annotation region selection suffer from high computational and memory costs, irrelevant region choices, and heavy reliance on uncertainty sampling. We propose decomposition sampling (DECOMP), a new active learning sampling strategy that addresses these limitations. It enhances annotation diversity by decomposing images into class-specific components using pseudo-labels and sampling regions from each class. Class-wise predictive confidence further guides the sampling process, ensuring that difficult classes receive additional annotations. Across ROI classification, 2-D segmentation, and 3-D segmentation, DECOMP consistently surpasses baseline methods by better sampling minority-class regions and boosting performance on these challenging classes.

Data-driven scene generation offers a low-cost alternative by synthesizing complex traffic behaviors from existing driving logs. However, existing models often lack controllability or yield samples that violate physical or social constraints, limiting their usability. We present OMEGA, an optimization-guided, training-free framework that enforces structural consistency and interaction awareness during diffusion-based sampling from a scene generation model. OMEGA re-anchors each reverse diffusion step via constrained optimization, steering the generation towards physically plausible and behaviorally coherent trajectories. Building on this framework, we formulate ego-attacker interactions as a game-theoretic optimization in the distribution space, approximating Nash equilibria to generate realistic, safety-critical adversarial scenarios. Experiments on nuPlan and Waymo show that OMEGA improves generation realism, consistency, and controllability, increasing the ratio of physically and behaviorally valid scenes from 32.35% to 72.27% for free exploration capabilities, and from 11% to 80% for controllability-focused generation.

We introduce the EgoCampus dataset, which spans 25 unique outdoor paths over 6 km across a university campus with recordings from more than 80 distinct human pedestrians, resulting in a diverse set of gaze-annotated videos. The system used for collection, Meta's Project Aria glasses, integrates eye tracking, front-facing RGB cameras, inertial sensors, and GPS to provide rich data from the human perspective. Unlike many prior egocentric datasets that focus on indoor tasks or exclude eye gaze information, our work emphasizes visual attention while subjects walk in outdoor campus paths. Using this data, we develop EgoCampusNet, a novel method to predict eye gaze of navigating pedestrians as they move through outdoor environments. Our contributions provide both a new resource for studying real-world attention and a resource for future work in gaze prediction models for navigation.

To effectively model such objects, it is essential to recover both part segmentation and the underlying joint parameters. Despite the importance of this task, previous work has largely focused on setups like multi-view systems, object scanning, or static cameras. In this paper, we present the first data-driven approach that jointly predicts part segmentation and joint parameters from monocular video captured with a freely moving camera. Trained solely on synthetic data, our method demonstrates strong generalization to real-world objects, offering a scalable and practical solution for articulated object understanding. Our approach operates directly on casually recorded video, making it suitable for real-time applications in dynamic environments.

Training or even finetuning such models demands vast datasets and computational resources, which are often scarce and costly. Adaptation methods provide a computationally efficient solution to address these limitations by allowing such models to be finetuned on small amounts of data and computing power. This is achieved by appending new trainable modules to frozen backbones with only a fraction of the trainable parameters and fitting only these modules on novel tasks. Recently, the VeRA adapter was shown to excel in parameter-efficient adaptations by utilizing a pair of frozen random low-rank matrices shared across all layers. In this paper, we propose PVeRA, a probabilistic version of the VeRA adapter, which modifies the low-rank matrices of VeRA in a probabilistic manner. This modification naturally allows handling inherent ambiguities in the input and allows for different sampling configurations during training and testing. A comprehensive evaluation was performed on the VTAB-1k benchmark and seven adapters, with PVeRA outperforming VeRA and other adapters.

Our Gabor-enhanced segmentation model leverages orientation-aware features with 72 directional kernels to accurately identify and segment cage structures that severely impair the performance of existing methods.

In contrast, generative video models show promising performance by synthesizing photorealistic and dynamic results, but they frequently struggle with unstable behavior, including body structural errors and identity drift. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework employs a 3D reconstruction model to provide robust structural and appearance priors, which in turn guides a real-time autoregressive video diffusion model for rendering. This process enables the model to synthesize high-frequency, photorealistic details and fluid dynamics in real time, effectively reducing texture blur and motion stiffness while preventing the structural inconsistencies common in video generation methods. By uniting the geometric stability of 3D reconstruction with the generative capabilities of video models, our method produces high-fidelity digital avatars with realistic appearance and dynamic, temporally coherent motion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces artifacts and achieves substantial improvements in visual quality over leading methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for real-time applications such as gaming and virtual reality.

While DiffusionDrive employs predefined anchors representing different driving intentions to partition the action space and generate diverse trajectories, its reliance on imitation learning lacks sufficient constraints, resulting in a dilemma between diversity and consistent high quality. In this work, we propose DiffusionDriveV2, which leverages reinforcement learning to both constrain low-quality modes and explore for superior trajectories. This significantly enhances the overall output quality while preserving the inherent multimodality of its core Gaussian Mixture Model. First, we use scale-adaptive multiplicative noise, ideal for trajectory planning, to promote broad exploration. Second, we employ intra-anchor GRPO to manage advantage estimation among samples generated from a single anchor, and inter-anchor truncated GRPO to incorporate a global perspective across different anchors, preventing improper advantage comparisons between distinct intentions (e.g., turning vs. going straight), which can lead to further mode collapse. DiffusionDriveV2 achieves 91.2 PDMS on the NAVSIM v1 dataset and 85.5 EPDMS on the NAVSIM v2 dataset in closed-loop evaluation with an aligned ResNet-34 backbone, setting a new record. Further experiments validate that our approach resolves the dilemma between diversity and consistent high quality for truncated diffusion models, achieving the best trade-off.

There exist two approaches: one trains a transformer via an auto-regressive paradigm, and the other adopts a two-stage scheme connecting pre-trained understanding and generative models for alignment fine-tuning. The former demands massive data and computing resources unaffordable for ordinary researchers. Though the latter requires a lower training cost, existing works often suffer from limited task coverage or poor generation quality. Both approaches lack the ability to parse input meta-information (such as task type, image resolution, video duration, etc.) and require manual parameter configuration that is tedious and non-intelligent. In this paper, we propose Unison which adopts the two-stage scheme while preserving the capabilities of the pre-trained models well. With an extremely low training cost, we cover a variety of multimodal understanding tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as diverse generation tasks, such as text-to-visual content generation, editing, controllable generation, and IP-based reference generation. We also equip our model with the ability to automatically parse user intentions, determine the target task type, and accurately extract the meta-information required for the corresponding task. This enables full automation of various multimodal tasks without human intervention. Experiments demonstrate that, under a low-cost setting of only 500k training samples and 50 GPU hours, our model can accurately and automatically identify tasks and extract relevant parameters, and achieve superior performance across a variety of understanding and generation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unison\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ec5\u970050\u4e07\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u548c50GPU\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u6790\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u6790\u8f93\u5165\u5143\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u914d\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u6790\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u63d0\u53d6\u6240\u9700\u5143\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u752850\u4e07\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u548c50GPU\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "Unison\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u6790\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u666e\u901a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present UltrasODM, a dual-stream framework that assists sonographers during acquisition through calibrated per-frame uncertainty, saliency-based diagnostics, and actionable prompts. UltrasODM integrates (i) a contrastive ranking module that groups frames by motion similarity, (ii) an optical-flow stream fused with Dual-Mamba temporal modules for robust 6-DoF pose estimation, and (iii) a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) layer combining Bayesian uncertainty, clinician-calibrated thresholds, and saliency maps highlighting regions of low confidence. When uncertainty exceeds the threshold, the system issues unobtrusive alerts suggesting corrective actions such as re-scanning highlighted regions or slowing the sweep. Evaluated on a clinical freehand ultrasound dataset, UltrasODM reduces drift by 15.2%, distance error by 12.1%, and Hausdorff distance by 10.1% relative to UltrasOM, while producing per-frame uncertainty and saliency outputs. By emphasizing transparency and clinician feedback, UltrasODM improves reconstruction reliability and supports safer, more trustworthy clinical workflows.

Given the significant gap across visible and infrared modality, estimating reliable cross-modality association becomes a major challenge in USVI-ReID. Existing methods usually adopt optimal transport to associate the intra-modality clusters, which is prone to propagating the local cluster errors, and also overlooks global instance-level relations. By mining and attending to the visible-infrared modality bias, this paper focuses on addressing cross-modality learning from two aspects: bias-mitigated global association and modality-invariant representation learning. Motivated by the camera-aware distance rectification in single-modality re-ID, we propose modality-aware Jaccard distance to mitigate the distance bias caused by modality discrepancy, so that more reliable cross-modality associations can be estimated through global clustering. To further improve cross-modality representation learning, a `split-and-contrast' strategy is designed to obtain modality-specific global prototypes. By explicitly aligning these prototypes under global association guidance, modality-invariant yet ID-discriminative representation learning can be achieved.

The primary obstacle to automating this process has been the lack of large-scale, \"in-the-wild\" video datasets suitable for training robust deep learning models. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark with three novel datasets: Gorilla-SPAC-Wild, the largest video dataset for wild primate re-identification to date; Gorilla-Berlin-Zoo, for assessing cross-domain re-identification generalization; and Gorilla-SPAC-MoT, for evaluating multi-object tracking in camera trap footage. Building on these datasets, we present GorillaWatch, an end-to-end pipeline integrating detection, tracking, and re-identification. To exploit temporal information, we introduce a multi-frame self-supervised pretraining strategy that leverages consistency in tracklets to learn domain-specific features without manual labels. To ensure scientific validity, a differentiable adaptation of AttnLRP verifies that our model relies on discriminative biometric traits rather than background correlations. Extensive benchmarking subsequently demonstrates that aggregating features from large-scale image backbones outperforms specialized video architectures. Finally, we address unsupervised population counting by integrating spatiotemporal constraints into standard clustering to mitigate over-segmentation.

Yet, existing approaches such as VAEs and foundation model aligned encoders implicitly constrain the latent space without explicitly shaping its distribution, making it unclear which types of distributions are optimal for modeling. We introduce \\textbf{Distribution-Matching VAE} (\\textbf{DMVAE}), which explicitly aligns the encoder's latent distribution with an arbitrary reference distribution via a distribution matching constraint. This generalizes beyond the Gaussian prior of conventional VAEs, enabling alignment with distributions derived from self-supervised features, diffusion noise, or other prior distributions. With DMVAE, we can systematically investigate which latent distributions are more conducive to modeling, and we find that SSL-derived distributions provide an excellent balance between reconstruction fidelity and modeling efficiency, reaching gFID equals 3.2 on ImageNet with only 64 training epochs. Our results suggest that choosing a suitable latent distribution structure (achieved via distribution-level alignment), rather than relying on fixed priors, is key to bridging the gap between easy-to-model latents and high-fidelity image synthesis.

In this work, we propose OneStory, enabling global yet compact cross-shot context modeling for consistent and scalable narrative generation. OneStory reformulates MSV as a next-shot generation task, enabling autoregressive shot synthesis while leveraging pretrained image-to-video (I2V) models for strong visual conditioning. We introduce two key modules: a Frame Selection module that constructs a semantically-relevant global memory based on informative frames from prior shots, and an Adaptive Conditioner that performs importance-guided patchification to generate compact context for direct conditioning. We further curate a high-quality multi-shot dataset with referential captions to mirror real-world storytelling patterns, and design effective training strategies under the next-shot paradigm. Finetuned from a pretrained I2V model on our curated 60K dataset, OneStory achieves state-of-the-art narrative coherence across diverse and complex scenes in both text- and image-conditioned settings, enabling controllable and immersive long-form video storytelling.", "AI": {"tldr": "OneStory\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u955c\u5934\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u8de8\u955c\u5934\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5c06MSV\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u955c\u5934\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u955c\u5934\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u8de8\u955c\u5934\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u9650\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u6216\u5355\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u590d\u6742\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u5c06MSV\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u955c\u5934\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u955c\u5934\u4fe1\u606f\u5e27\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u5168\u5c40\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u6267\u884c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u5316\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u76f4\u63a5\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u768460K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0cOneStory\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u548c\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002", "conclusion": "OneStory\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u4e14\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8de8\u955c\u5934\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u955c\u5934\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u53d9\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This dual hierarchy achieves both computational efficiency and representational richness, enabling fast reconstruction of large and complex scenes.

This allows for a more intuitive human-computer interaction, enabling querying or editing scenes using natural language, and could potentially improve tasks like scene retrieval, navigation, and multimodal reasoning. While such capabilities could be transformative, in particular for large-scale scenes, we find that recent feature distillation approaches cannot effectively learn over massive Internet data due to challenges in semantic feature misalignment and inefficiency in memory and runtime. To this end, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges. First, we introduce extremely low-dimensional semantic bottleneck features as part of the underlying 3D Gaussian representation. These are processed by rendering and passing them through a multi-resolution, feature-based, hash encoder. This significantly improves efficiency both in runtime and GPU memory. Second, we introduce an Attenuated Downsampler module and propose several regularizations addressing the semantic misalignment of ground truth 2D features.

To address this gap, we introduce OpenVE-3M, an open-source, large-scale, and high-quality dataset for instruction-based video editing. It comprises two primary categories: spatially-aligned edits (Global Style, Background Change, Local Change, Local Remove, Local Add, and Subtitles Edit) and non-spatially-aligned edits (Camera Multi-Shot Edit and Creative Edit). All edit types are generated via a meticulously designed data pipeline with rigorous quality filtering. OpenVE-3M surpasses existing open-source datasets in terms of scale, diversity of edit types, instruction length, and overall quality. Furthermore, to address the lack of a unified benchmark in the field, we construct OpenVE-Bench, containing 431 video-edit pairs that cover a diverse range of editing tasks with three key metrics highly aligned with human judgment. We present OpenVE-Edit, a 5B model trained on our dataset that demonstrates remarkable efficiency and effectiveness by setting a new state-of-the-art on OpenVE-Bench, outperforming all prior open-source models including a 14B baseline.

This stems from insufficient cross-modal interaction and limited modal diversity for comprehensive world knowledge representation. To address these limitations, we introduce UnityVideo, a unified framework for world-aware video generation that jointly learns across multiple modalities (segmentation masks, human skeletons, DensePose, optical flow, and depth maps) and training paradigms. Our approach features two core components: (1) dynamic noising to unify heterogeneous training paradigms, and (2) a modality switcher with an in-context learner that enables unified processing via modular parameters and contextual learning. We contribute a large-scale unified dataset with 1.3M samples. Through joint optimization, UnityVideo accelerates convergence and significantly enhances zero-shot generalization to unseen data. We demonstrate that UnityVideo achieves superior video quality, consistency, and improved alignment with physical world constraints.

Existing methods either over-simplify geometry or fail to achieve the pixel-precise, palette-constrained aesthetics of voxel art. We introduce Voxify3D, a differentiable two-stage framework bridging 3D mesh optimization with 2D pixel art supervision. Our core innovation lies in the synergistic integration of three components: (1) orthographic pixel art supervision that eliminates perspective distortion for precise voxel-pixel alignment; (2) patch-based CLIP alignment that preserves semantics across discretization levels; (3) palette-constrained Gumbel-Softmax quantization enabling differentiable optimization over discrete color spaces with controllable palette strategies. This integration addresses fundamental challenges: semantic preservation under extreme discretization, pixel-art aesthetics through volumetric rendering, and end-to-end discrete optimization. Experiments show superior performance (37.12 CLIP-IQA, 77.90\\% user preference) across diverse characters and controllable abstraction (2-8 colors, 20x-50x resolutions).
