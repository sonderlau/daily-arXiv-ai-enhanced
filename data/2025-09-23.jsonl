One of the most\ncommon tools used to check if everything is working properly is called\nStatistical Process Control (SPC). Traditional SPC methods work by checking\nwhether recent measurements are within acceptable limits. However, they only\nreact after a problem has already occurred. This can lead to wasted materials,\nmachine downtime, and increased costs. In this paper, we present a smarter way\nto use SPC. Instead of just reacting to issues after they happen, our system\ncan predict future problems before they occur. We use a machine learning tool\ncalled Facebook Prophet, which is designed to work with time-series data (data\nthat changes over time). Prophet looks at past data and forecasts what the next\nvalue will be. Then, we use SPC rules to decide if the predicted value is in a\nSafe zone (no problem), a Warning zone (needs attention), or a Critical zone\n(may require shutting down the process). We applied this system to real data\nfrom a semiconductor manufacturing company. One of the challenges with this\ndata is that the measurements are not taken at regular time intervals. This\nmakes it harder to predict future values accurately. Despite this, our model\nwas able to make strong predictions and correctly classify the risk level of\nfuture measurements. The main benefit of our system is that it gives engineers\nand technicians a chance to act early - before something goes wrong. This helps\nreduce unexpected failures and improves the overall stability and reliability\nof the production process.

Moreover, they also suffer from misalignment\nbetween the prompts and the region of interest in the images. Without human\nguidance, the model may focus on the wrong regions and miss small,\nhigh-frequency details when prompts or scenes change. In this paper, we propose\nGazeVLM, a training-free framework that uses the human eye gaze as a natural\nsupervisory signal to allocate computation where it matters. By extracting\ngaze-driven regions of interest (ROIs) and optionally combining them with a\nlow-resolution global view, GazeVLM mimics fovea-periphery perception to cut\nredundant visual tokens while preserving task-relevant details. We evaluate the\nvisual question answering tasks on Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B on the VOILA-COCO benchmark\nwith human gaze. Quality of the answer is assessed by GPT-4o pairwise judging\nand a weighted score over coverage, accuracy, details, and fluency. Efficiency\nis measured by token counts and FLOPs. GazeVLM reduces visual tokens by up to\n93.1%, total tokens by up to 59.6%, and FLOPs by 50%, while keeping better\nanswer quality relative to full-resolution baselines. Our results show that\naligning model computation with human gaze offers a simple, plug-and-play path\ntoward efficient VLM inference on consumer devices."}

Prior work aims to mitigate this bottleneck by exploiting\nsparsity in the attention layers to reduce computation. However, these works\ntypically rely on block-sparse attention, which skips score computation only\nwhen all entries in a block of attention scores (corresponding to M queries and\nM keys, with M = 64 typically) are zero.

In\nthis work, we introduce the Model Parity Aligner (MPA), a novel framework\ndesigned to systematically improve S-VLMs by leveraging unlabeled images and\neffective knowledge transfer from L-VLMs. Instead of traditional knowledge\ndistillation methods that rely on labeled training data, MPA employs a\nstrategic parity-based approach that precisely identifies the knowledge\ndisparities between S-VLMs and L-VLMs, and optimizes training by targeting only\nthese disparities. We conduct extensive experiments on four diverse VQA\nbenchmarks, namely TextVQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA, and OKVQA, each of which requires\nspecialized reasoning capabilities such as text recognition, chart\ninterpretation, and commonsense and factual understanding. Our results\ndemonstrate that MPA consistently enhances the performance of S-VLMs on all\nbenchmarks, reducing the performance gap while maintaining computational\nefficiency. We make our code publicly available."}

In recent work,\nMcTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related\nwith DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs.

Parameter\ndrift can be conceptualized as a form of noise that obscures critical patterns\nlearned for previous tasks. However, recent researches have shown that noise is\nnot always harmful. For example, the large number of visual patterns learned\nfrom pre-training can be easily abused by a single task, and introducing\nappropriate noise can suppress some low-correlation features, thus leaving a\nmargin for future tasks. To this end, we propose learning beneficial noise for\nCIL guided by information theory and propose Mixture of Noise (Min), aiming to\nmitigate the degradation of backbone generalization from adapting new tasks.\nSpecifically, task-specific noise is learned from high-dimension features of\nnew tasks. Then, a set of weights is adjusted dynamically for optimal mixture\nof different task noise. Finally, Min embeds the beneficial noise into the\nintermediate features to mask the response of inefficient patterns. Extensive\nexperiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that Min achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in most incremental settings, with particularly\noutstanding results in 50-steps incremental settings. This shows the\nsignificant potential for beneficial noise in continual learning."}

This\npaper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these\ncosts on our belief updating mechanisms.\n  We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents\nweigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost\nrequired to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform\ncomputational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this\nresource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human\nbehaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation.

To address this, we repurpose real\nRGB datasets to train event-based estimators.

First, we design the hierarchical neural\nsemantic representation (HNSR), which consists of a global semantic feature to\ncapture high-level structure and multi-resolution local geometric features to\npreserve fine details, by carefully harnessing 3D priors from pre-trained 3D\ngenerative models. Second, we design a progressive global-to-local matching\nstrategy, which establishes coarse semantic correspondence using the global\nsemantic feature, then iteratively refines it with local geometric features,\nyielding accurate and semantically-consistent mappings. Third, our framework is\ntraining-free and broadly compatible with various pre-trained 3D generative\nbackbones, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse shape categories.\nOur method also supports various applications, such as shape co-segmentation,\nkeypoint matching, and texture transfer, and generalizes well to structurally\ndiverse shapes, with promising results even in cross-category scenarios.

This paper addresses this gap by proposing a new paradigm for\npretraining foundation models in downstream domains.

We propose the Core Space merging framework, which\nenables the merging of LoRA-adapted models within a common alignment basis,\nthereby preserving the efficiency of low-rank adaptation while substantially\nimproving accuracy across tasks. We further provide a formal proof that\nprojection into Core Space ensures no loss of information and provide a\ncomplexity analysis showing the efficiency gains. Extensive empirical results\ndemonstrate that Core Space significantly improves existing merging techniques\nand achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision and language tasks while\nutilizing a fraction of the computational resources.

However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental\naspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological\nfindings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational\nrelevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of\nanatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs\n(GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to\nlocalize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that\noverlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged\nacross nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a\nlocalization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%),\nall lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark\n(80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's\npredictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always\nprecisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical\nlocations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited\nanatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the\nlowest performance on all pathologies, showing limited capacity to generalize\nto this novel task. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of\ncurrent MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating\nthem with task-specific tools for reliable use."}

While current vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in\nthose settings, they struggle with complex queries in LVQA over long videos\ninvolving multi-step temporal reasoning and causality. Vanilla approaches,\nwhich sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM with the question, incur\nsignificant token overhead, forcing severe downsampling. As a result, the model\noften misses fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, or key\ntemporal cues, ultimately leading to incorrect answers. To address these\nlimitations, recent works have explored query-adaptive frame sampling,\nhierarchical keyframe selection, and agent-based iterative querying. However,\nthese methods remain fundamentally heuristic: they lack explicit temporal\nrepresentations and cannot enforce or verify logical event relationships. As a\nresult, there are no formal guarantees that the sampled context actually\nencodes the compositional or causal logic demanded by the question. To address\nthese foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play\nneuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA translates a natural language\nquestion into a formal temporal logic expression, constructs a video automaton\nfrom frame-level semantic propositions, and applies model checking to\nrigorously identify video segments satisfying the question's logical\nrequirements. Only these logic-verified segments are submitted to the VLM, thus\nimproving interpretability, reducing hallucinations, and enabling compositional\nreasoning without modifying or fine-tuning the model. Experiments on\nLongVideoBench and CinePile show NeuS-QA improves performance by over 10%,\nespecially on questions involving event ordering, causality, and multi-step\ncompositional reasoning."}

We introduce a new\nparadigm for attribute-specific image prompting, in which distinct sets of\nreference images are used to guide the generation of individual aspects of\nhuman appearance, such as hair, clothing, and identity. Our method encodes\nthese inputs into attribute-specific tokens, which are injected into a\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion model.

To promote natural composition and robust\ndisentanglement, we curate a cross-reference training dataset featuring\nsubjects in diverse poses and expressions, and propose a multi-attribute\ncross-reference training strategy that encourages the model to generate\nfaithful outputs from misaligned attribute inputs while adhering to both\nidentity and textual conditioning.
