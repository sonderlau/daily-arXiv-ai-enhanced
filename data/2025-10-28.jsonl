For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical\nSentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample\nMedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a\nfine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by\npost-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug\ninteraction (DDI) screening.

However, real-world datasets often suffer from the\nproblem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is\nmissing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods\ntypically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep\nneural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across\nmodalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a\nlow-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible\nmultimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned\nproblem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance\nrepresentation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize\nincomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for\ncross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we\nmodel and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible\nstructure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow\nmodel, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent\nspace of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the\nreconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight\nTransformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating\nthe overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the\nlow-rank Transformer.

While\ncentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a\ncentral coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer\nfrom scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed\nTraining with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed\nlearning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and\nlimited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion\nModel Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.\nBuilt upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP\nemploys Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future\ntrajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby\nalleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE\nmethods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field\n(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This\ndesign mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with\nminimal communication overhead in distributed settings.

Prior work\nprimarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather\nthan visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by\namplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.\nHowever, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where\nattention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and\nneglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without\nadjusting attention to the user query.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided\nCross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual\nsaliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or \"gaze\nshifts\", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify\nattention to both salient visual information and the user query at each\ndecoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant\ntokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for\nwell-integrated representation.

However, these models face a\nfundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the\ntokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,\nrisking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,\nintroducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally\nlimit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by\npositing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level\nstructured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby\nbypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through\na systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we\ntested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of\nboth. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and\nsubstantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion\nof the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades\nperformance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for\nmodels with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the\nprimary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to\ninterpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for\nreasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge.

A critical yet\nchallenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's\nintrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is\nhindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with\ncontinuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D\nreconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their\neffectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we\nintegrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth\nestimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint\ndepth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose\nnetwork and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for\nefficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD\npublic datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent\nstate-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and\n3D reconstruction.

Image watermarking for diffusion\nmodels, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as\nspecific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the\ninfomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the\ngeneration process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing\nthe watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to\nbalance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve\nstrong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which\ndegrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile\nfor real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a\ntwo-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike\nprior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances\nrobustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while\nrandomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our\ntwo-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly\ngenerated session key into both encryption pipelines.

Recent studies have\nshown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve\ndistillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires\nmultiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,\nwe propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that\ngenerates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single\nteacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we\nintroduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle\ndiversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving\nproximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,\nwhich encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The\nensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original\nteacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate\nthat our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby\nreduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more\neffective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an\nexisting knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations.

Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\\% Recall@1 on\nUniversity-1652 while being over $5 \\times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3\n\\times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS\non the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for\nreal-time UAV applications.

Image watermarking for diffusion\nmodels, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as\nspecific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the\ninfomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the\ngeneration process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing\nthe watermark before extraction.

Some methods achieve\nstrong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which\ndegrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile\nfor real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a\ntwo-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS).

SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for\nstyle-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD)\nfor efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency\nModule (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style\nsemantic invariance.

While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of\nperforming a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they\ncan identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and\nTransition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for\nrigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in\nobject states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a\nnovel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks\nsimultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and\nstate change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully\nhand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state\ndescriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a\nlarge-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million\nsemi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest\nresource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we\ndemonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and\nreveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to\ncapture subtle object state distinctions.

We argue that when\nboth constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares\n(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large\nextent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction\nterm introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary.

Furthermore, this\ninterpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by\nreinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure\ntensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly\nfrom quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and\nnon-angular tessellations.

Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized\nIterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively\nutilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not\nonly improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more\nthan 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on\nreal-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow\nachieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly\nshortening processing times.

Unlike prior evaluations that measure only\nfinal-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual\npuzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error,\nmodels must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables\nfine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual\nreasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric,\nand analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern\nmatching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap\nbetween fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible\nCoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer\ngeneration from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on\nmultimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic\nevaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs."}

However, most\nexisting MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often\noverlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,\nwe present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables\nadvanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both\nimages and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention\npredominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive\nObject Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object\nrepresentations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual\ntokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of\nPixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion\nmodule to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight\nObject-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while\nmaintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction\ntuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction\ndataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that\nPixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while\nPixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency."}

To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies:\n(i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing\ndifferent levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image\nto both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the\ncurrent image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges\nof traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable\ndevelopment scores.

To\ngenerate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking\nability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human\ninstructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and\nboundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,\nthis paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction\n(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,\nadaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,\nwe propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate\nthe unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language\nreferences. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the\noptimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,\ntherefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of\nmulti-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded\nattacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from\nincomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are\nproposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger\nscenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,\nwe propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by\nclarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more\neffective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR.
