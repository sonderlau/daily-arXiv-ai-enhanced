SDM represents cloud droplets as weighted superdroplets, enabling\nhigh-fidelity representations of microphysical processes such as\ncollision-coalescence. However, the algorithm can undercount collisions when\nthe expected number of events is not realizable given the superdroplet\nconfiguration, introducing a biased error referred here as the collision\ndeficit. While SDM exhibits statistical spread inherent to Monte Carlo schemes,\nthe deficit is a systematic underestimation of collision events. This error can\nbe addressed with adaptive time-stepping, which dynamically adjusts simulation\ntime steps to eliminate this deficit. We analyze the behavior of the deficit\nacross a wide range of timesteps, superdroplet counts, and initialization\nstrategies, and explore trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. Using the\nclassical Safranov-Golovin test case, we show that the deficit increases with\ntimestep and superdroplet count, and that adaptive time-stepping effectively\nremoves the associated error without significant cost. We test a smooth\ncontinuum of initial distributions with extrema representing two different\ninitialization methods, and find that while the deficit is sensitive to the\nchoice of attribute-space sampling strategies, adaptive time-stepping\nsubstantially reduces the difference, allowing for users to choose\ninitialization methods optimized for other processes. We also propose a method\nof visualization, capturing both the attribute sampling, droplet interactions\nover multiple timesteps, and the deficit using network connectivity graphs. In\n2-D flow-coupled simulations, we find the deficit can have a stronger effect on\nconvergence than previously shown, with uncorrected deficit delaying the onset\nof precipitation."}

Firstly, a\nMultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask\nsegmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse\nmasks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided\nmask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks\nand superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a\nself-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the\nquality of predicted masks.

Unlike previous representation learning works that\nare tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise\nrepresentations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale\nrepresentations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More\nspecifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and\nWarp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations.

In\noptimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting\nrepresentations of the same action class across different permutations, while\nROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between\ntwo permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive\nLearning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations\noptimized for action segmentation.

Albeit efficient,\nPointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods\ndue to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to\npreserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a\ntwo-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows\nbetter performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the\nfirst two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,\nnarrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art\nmethods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel\ncomponents that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,\nwe introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D\nvoxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D\nconvolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels\ncan be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a\nseparable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using\n3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context\nfeature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a\nsparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,\nand fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object\nproposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good\ncompromise in terms of speed and accuracy."}

Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers\n6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method\non the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and\nsynthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates\nimproved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint\nlocalisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising\ngeneralisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions."}

TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the\nredundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal\ninformation based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output\nto the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method\nis general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on\nboth seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different\ntoken pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that\nmaintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of\nrepresentative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

This freedom of movement is\nreferred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any\nposition (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,\nthough, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the\nreconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the\nscene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as\n3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to\nsmall offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of\ncoordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error\nin pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to\nthe squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new\nquantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion\nperformance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden\nscene."}

This deviates from the expectation that the model should\nincrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data\nstreams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the\ndiscriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to\nrestricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class\nconfusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation\nlearning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown\nrepresentations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an\nangular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating\nexcessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt\na virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known\nrepresentations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through\nboundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification\nstrategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation\nbias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and\npositive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100\nand TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR.

To improve the encoder's\nability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of\nlabeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning\nmethod that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary\nrepetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the\nentire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary\nsegmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy\nwith substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it\nas a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited\nclinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github\nrepository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin."}

Motivated by\nrecent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning\ncan further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving\nReasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based\nthinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to\nguide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained\ndetails, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train\nIRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),\nwhich targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate\nstage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality\ntextual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a\nsubsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed\nlearning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full\nthinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that\nnatively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first\nbuilds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline\nin the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA\nperformance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,\nGenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality\nand fine-grained fidelity.

However, the high computational costs of these video\npose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.\nIn this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering\nframework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient\ntransformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with\nprogressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering\nfull-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate\ntransformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two\nkey modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module\n(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the\nredundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal\ninformation based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output\nto the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method\nis general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on\nboth seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different\ntoken pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that\nmaintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of\nrepresentative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
