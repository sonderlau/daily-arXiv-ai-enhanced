### [1] [Perturbing the surface energy balance to emulate the historical pattern of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature trends](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02892)
*Timothy M. Merlis*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了热带太平洋地区海表温度（SST）梯度增强的现象，通过理想化表面能量平衡计算，量化了五种扰动对观测趋势的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热带太平洋SST梯度的增强可能超出历史模拟范围，且对气候其他方面有重要影响，因此需要理解其敏感性。

Method: 采用理想化表面能量平衡计算，量化五种扰动（如海洋热通量、辐射强迫、表面辐射反馈等）对SST梯度变化的贡献。

Result: 研究发现，西太平洋比东太平洋多升温0.4K，且需要约3 W/m²的纬向不对称能量倾向才能匹配观测趋势。

Conclusion: 这些能量预算变化的“故事线”有助于评估耦合气候模型中可能缺失或低估的机制。

Abstract: The strengthening of the zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient
observed in the tropical Pacific in recent decades is a regional climate change
signal that may be outside the range of historical simulations with
comprehensive climate models. Given the important role that this change has on
other aspects of climate, a series of idealized surface energy balance
calculations with imposed parameters is performed to build a baseline
understanding of the sensitivities that govern these changes. I quantify the
requisite magnitudes of five perturbations that reach a new equilibrium with a
mean-SST warming of about $0.5 \, \mathrm{K}$ and about $0.4 \, \mathrm{K}$
more west Pacific warming than east Pacific warming, based approximately on
observed trends. A characteristic magnitude of zonal asymmetry in a surface
energy tendency that can bring changes in line with observed trends is $\approx
3 \, \mathrm{W \, m^{-2}}$. Strengthened zonal SST gradients can arise from a
more zonally asymmetric ocean heat flux that increases by $\approx 20\% \,
\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ using that implied by ERA5's surface fluxes, a spatially
varying radiative forcing with a west--east contrast of $\approx 3.3 \,
\mathrm{W \, m^{-2}}$, a more amplifying surface radiative feedback in the west
than the east with a contrast of $\approx 4 \, \mathrm{W \, m^{-2} \, K^{-1}}$,
a surface-air relative humidity (RH) contrast that increases RH in the west and
decreases it in the east by $\approx 0.5 \% \, \mathrm{K^{-1}}$, or a more
zonally asymmetric wind speed that increases by $\approx 16 \% \,
\mathrm{K^{-1}}$. The ``storylines'' of forced surface energy budget change
identified here are valuable in determining the plausibility of mechanisms that
may be absent or underestimated in coupled climate model simulations.

### [2] [A Summer Meridional Subsurface Temperature Dipole Mode in the South China Sea](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03032)
*Ximing Wu,Fengchao Yao,Dongxiao Wang*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 南海夏季次表层温度偶极子模式影响上层海洋热含量年际变化，主要由风应力旋度异常驱动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究南海海洋热含量变化对区域气候和极端天气事件（如热带气旋）的影响。

Method: 利用高分辨率海洋再分析数据，分析南海夏季次表层温度偶极子模式及其与季风变率的关系。

Result: 发现南海存在夏季次表层温度偶极子模式，与季风强度相关，垂直热输送是主要驱动机制。

Conclusion: 南海热含量年际变化受次表层温度偶极子模式控制，与季风和ENSO变率相关。

Abstract: The ocean heat content variability in the South China Sea (SCS) plays a
pivotal role in regional climate and extreme weather events, such as tropical
cyclones. Using high-resolution ocean reanalysis data, we show that the SCS
exhibits a summer subsurface temperature dipole mode that controls the
interannual variability of ocean heat content in the upper SCS. This dipole
mode manifests as warm anomalies in the north and cold anomalies in the south
during strong monsoon years, and a reversed pattern during weak monsoons years.
The monsoon variability is linked to large-scale climate variability associated
with El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation transitions. Heat budget analysis indicates
that this dipole pattern is primarily driven by vertical heat transport linked
to opposite wind stress curl anomalies in the northern and southern basin.
Accompanying the vertical heat transports is a shallow meridional overturning
circulation that redistributes heat between the northern and southern SCS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代卷积神经网络（CNN）存在数据效率低、泛化能力差和对抗性攻击脆弱等问题，而灵长类视觉系统表现出更高的效率和鲁棒性，因此研究其架构原理以改进人工视觉系统。

Method: 提出Visual Cortex Network（VCNet），模拟灵长类视觉皮层的层次处理、双流信息分离和自上而下的预测反馈机制。

Conclusion: 将神经科学原理融入网络设计可提升模型的效率和鲁棒性，为解决机器学习中的长期挑战提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite their success in image classification, modern convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency,
poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior
efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural principles may
offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision systems. This paper
introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture
whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual
cortex. VCNet emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical
processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation,
and top-down predictive feedback. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized
benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset and a light field image
classification task. Our results show that VCNet achieves a classification
accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset,
surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that
integrating neuroscientific principles into network design can lead to more
efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing
long-standing challenges in machine learning.

self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2)
Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences
through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid
structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature
representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model
obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW
datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies
significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose
estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation
technology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamVVT是一个基于扩散变换器（DiTs）的两阶段框架，用于视频虚拟试穿（VVT），通过利用未配对数据和预训练模型提升真实场景中的适应性和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端方法依赖稀缺的配对数据集，难以保留服装细节和时间一致性，DreamVVT旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 第一阶段使用多帧试穿模型和视觉语言模型（VLM）生成高质量关键帧试穿图像；第二阶段结合骨架图和动态描述，通过增强的视频生成模型确保时间一致性。

Result: 实验表明，DreamVVT在保留服装细节和时间稳定性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamVVT通过两阶段设计和预训练模型的有效利用，显著提升了视频虚拟试穿的效果。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

### [6] [Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829)
*Adam Colton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出在IJEPA架构中用DynTanh激活替代层归一化（LN），以保留视觉标记的自然能量层次，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 层归一化破坏了视觉标记的自然能量层次，导致语义重要区域未被优先处理，并引入棋盘状伪影。

Method: 用DynTanh激活替代层归一化，以保留标记能量并让高能量标记对预测损失贡献更大。

Result: 改进后模型在ImageNet线性探测准确率从38%提升至42.7%，NYU Depth V2深度估计RMSE降低0.08。

Conclusion: 保留标记自然能量对自监督视觉表示学习至关重要。

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

### [7] [GENIE: Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02831)
*Mikołaj Zieliński,Krzysztof Byrski,Tomasz Szczepanik,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE结合了NeRF的高保真渲染和GS的可编辑性，通过高斯特征嵌入和高效搜索实现实时编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF难以编辑，而GS适合交互但渲染质量较低，GENIE旨在结合两者优势。

Method: 使用高斯特征嵌入和RT-GPS搜索技术，结合多分辨率哈希网格实现高效编辑。

Result: GENIE支持实时、局部感知的编辑，兼容物理模拟，渲染质量高。

Conclusion: GENIE成功结合了隐式和显式表示的优势，填补了编辑与神经渲染之间的空白。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code

### [8] [RefineSeg: Dual Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02844)
*Anghong Du,Nay Aung,Theodoros N. Arvanitis,Stefan K. Piechnik,Joao A C Lima,Steffen E. Petersen,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于粗标注的医学图像分割框架，通过建模粗标注中的噪声区域，逐步优化网络输出，接近精确标注的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的高质量像素级标注成本高且需要专业知识，因此需要一种仅依赖粗标注的分割方法。

Method: 引入转移矩阵建模粗标注中的噪声区域，通过联合训练多组粗标注逐步优化网络输出。

Result: 在两个心脏影像数据集上验证了方法的有效性，性能接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督分割任务中表现优异，接近全监督方法的性能。

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生物启发的神经形态雷达框架，用于实时、低功耗的手势识别（HGR），采用事件驱动架构和异步sigma-delta编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统雷达HGR系统需要连续采样和处理数据，导致高功耗和计算开销。本文旨在通过生物启发的异步事件驱动方法解决这一问题。

Method: 系统包括24 GHz多普勒雷达前端和神经形态采样器，将中频信号转换为稀疏的基于尖峰的表示，并通过轻量级神经网络在Cortex-M0微控制器上进行实时处理。

Result: 在七名用户的五种手势数据集上，系统实现了>85%的实时准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架首次将生物启发的异步sigma-delta编码和事件驱动处理用于雷达HGR，显著降低了功耗和计算开销。

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand
gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by
biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based
HGR.

*Tianheng Zhu,Yiheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出MIDAR模型，通过模拟LiDAR检测结果，弥补微观交通模拟器在感知建模上的不足，支持多AV场景下的高效仿真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模真实AV部署不现实，现有仿真工具（如CARLA和SUMO）在感知建模和扩展性上存在局限，需要一种折中方案。

Method: 提出MIDAR模型，利用车辆级特征模拟LiDAR检测，构建RM-LoS图编码遮挡关系，采用GRU增强的APPNP架构进行特征传播。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MIDAR模拟主流LiDAR检测模型的AUC达到0.909，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MIDAR能无缝集成到交通模拟器和轨迹数据中，为需要精确车辆观测的任务提供支持，并将开源。

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Transformer在自然语言处理和计算机视觉中的成功，研究其在遥感图像中的表现成为必要，填补了大规模比较的空白。

Conclusion: Transformer在遥感图像目标检测中具有显著潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时难以保持高视觉保真度、真实创意和精确遵循用户指令。

Method: VisuCraft整合了多模态结构化信息提取器（E）和动态提示生成模块（G），提取图像细粒度属性并生成优化提示。

Result: 在ImageStoryGen-500K数据集上评估，VisuCraft在故事生成和诗歌创作等任务中表现优于基线模型，尤其在创意和指令遵循方面。

Conclusion: VisuCraft为大型视觉语言模型在复杂创意AI应用中开辟了新潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

Conclusion: 提出的稳健扩散模型在污染数据场景下表现优异，扩展了扩散模型的适用性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

Conclusion: 提出的方法在材料感知的RIR预测任务中表现出色，为声学特征生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了现成的大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉与语言导航（VLN）任务中的表现，发现其虽能完成任务，但效果不及专为导航设计的模型。

Motivation: 研究现成LVLMs在VLN任务中的潜力，并验证其是否支持低级和全景动作范式。

Method: 微调开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct，在Room-to-Room数据集上评估其性能。

Result: 模型在R2R测试集上达到41%的成功率，表现尚可但不及专用模型。

Conclusion: 现成LVLMs能支持VLN任务，但需进一步优化以匹敌专用模型。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

*Minh-Hai Nguyen,Edouard Pauwels,Pierre Weiss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAP估计在盲去卷积中倾向于模糊解，但通过扩散先验发现局部极小值对应清晰图像，需良好初始化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MAP估计在盲去卷积中的局限性，探索扩散先验如何揭示清晰解的可能性。

Method: 分析扩散先验的似然景观，理论分析盲去模糊后验，验证梯度下降局部极小值的效果。

Result: MAP估计倾向于模糊解，但局部极小值对应清晰图像，需优化初始化。

Conclusion: 克服MAP限制需关注后验景观的局部极小值，为设计更好先验和优化方法提供指导。

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练对小型模型在嵌入式设备上的鲁棒性影响，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 构建两个超小型主干网络家族，系统研究其性能，并利用缩放定律分析。

Result: 实验表明，预训练对小型模型仍有帮助，但模型过小时鲁棒性收益递减。

Conclusion: 建议使用预训练，并避免模型过小，以确保在不同工作条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to
different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

TL;DR: X-Actor是一个音频驱动的肖像动画框架，通过单张参考图像和音频生成逼真、情感丰富的说话头部视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注唇部同步和短时视觉保真度，X-Actor旨在实现长时、情感连贯的演员级肖像表演。

Method: 采用两阶段解耦生成流程：音频条件自回归扩散模型预测面部运动潜在标记，扩散视频合成模块将其转换为高保真视频。

Result: 实验表明，X-Actor能生成超越标准说话头部动画的电影级表演，并在长时音频驱动情感肖像表演中达到最优效果。

Conclusion: X-Actor通过解耦设计和扩散训练范式，实现了长时情感丰富的面部运动预测和高保真视频合成。

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich
motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond
standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in
long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.

*Dawei Zhang,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于尺度等变性的盲去噪框架，通过异构归一化模块（HNM）和交互门控模块（IGM）提升模型对空间异质噪声的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪模型在空间异质噪声（OOD条件）下泛化能力不足，尺度等变性被视为提升鲁棒性的核心归纳偏置。

Method: 提出包含HNM和IGM的盲去噪框架：HNM稳定特征分布并动态校正噪声强度变化下的特征，IGM通过门控交互调节信号与特征路径的信息流。

Result: 模型在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有方法，尤其在空间异质噪声条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: 尺度等变性是提升去噪模型OOD鲁棒性的有效方向，所提框架具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

*Alakh Desai,Nuno Vasconcelos*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ANSWER的训练无关技术，通过结合负提示与无分类器引导（CFG），提升扩散模型生成图像的质量和提示遵从性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量图像方面表现出色，但在提示遵从性和质量上存在显著差异。负提示虽能改善提示遵从性，但需要外部资源且不完整。

Method: 开发了ANSWER采样方法，利用扩散模型对否定的内部理解，无需显式负提示即可实现负条件生成。

Result: ANSWER在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，且人类评估显示其受欢迎程度是其他方法的两倍。

Conclusion: ANSWER是一种无需训练的技术，适用于支持CFG的任何模型，显著提升了图像生成的忠实度和质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

Motivation: 现有多领域学习架构中，共享和领域特定LoRA是否有效捕捉领域信息尚不明确。

Method: 将共享和领域特定LoRA分别置于预训练权重的列和左零子空间中，并应用于动作识别任务。

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:
shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular
domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures
domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,
Kinetics400, and HMDB51) and demonstrate its effectiveness in some cases along
with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

Abstract: Modern action recognition models suffer from static bias, leading to reduced

domain adaptation between RGB and edge information using edge frames in
addition to RGB frames to counter the static bias issue. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses static bias with a
lower computational cost, allowing for more robust action recognition than
previous approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗扰动方法对变换器检测器效果不佳，需一种统一且高效的方法。

Method: AFOG通过可学习的注意力机制聚焦脆弱区域，结合特征损失和迭代扰动注入。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，AFOG性能提升达83%，速度快且扰动不可见。

Conclusion: AFOG为对抗攻击提供了高效、通用的解决方案，适用于多种检测器。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的In-Generation Detection (IGD)方法，利用预测噪声检测NSFW内容，准确率达91.32%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成高质量图像的同时可能被滥用生成NSFW内容，现有方法未充分探索生成过程中的检测。

Method: IGD利用扩散过程中的预测噪声作为内部信号，区分NSFW与良性提示。

Result: 在七类NSFW内容上，IGD平均检测准确率为91.32%，优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: IGD是一种简单有效的NSFW内容检测方法，尤其在对抗性提示下表现优异。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了多粒度特征校准（MGFC）框架，通过从粗到细的特征对齐增强域泛化语义分割（DGSS）的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注全局特征微调，忽略了跨特征层次的分层适应，而这对密集预测任务至关重要。

Method: MGFC框架分三步校准视觉基础模型（VFM）特征：粗粒度特征捕获全局语义，中粒度特征提升类别区分性，细粒度特征增强空间细节。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，MGFC优于现有DGSS方法，验证了多粒度适应对语义分割任务的有效性。

Conclusion: MGFC通过分层和粒度感知校准，成功将VFM的泛化能力迁移到DGSS任务中。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在长视频理解中表现不佳，主要因资源限制无法处理所有帧信息。现有框架和任务集中于从大量无关帧中识别特定帧，不符合实际应用需求。

Method: 提出SLFG方法，将单帧组合成语义连贯的场景帧，利用场景定位和动态帧重组机制，无需修改原模型架构。

Result: 实验表明，SLFG在多个长视频基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: SLFG方法有效提升了MLLMs的长视频理解能力，具有即插即用性，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯模型压缩方法难以识别不重要的高斯点，导致存储需求高且渲染质量下降。

Method: SA-3DGS通过学习重要性评分识别不重要高斯点，结合聚类压缩和代码本修复技术优化模型。

Result: 实验显示，SA-3DGS在多个数据集上实现高达66倍压缩，同时保持或提升渲染质量。

Conclusion: SA-3DGS不仅高效压缩模型，还能提升其他基于剪枝的方法，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: MoCA通过创新机制显著提升了文本到视频生成中的身份一致性和细节表现。

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face
similarity.

Conclusion: VideoForest通过人物级特征统一多视频流，实现了高效跨视频推理。

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed
visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on
single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their
applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that
collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting
dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to

interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker
scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors.
To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,

*Hyebin Cho,Jaehyup Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FaceMat的无trimap、不确定性感知框架，用于在复杂遮挡下预测高质量alpha遮罩，提升了人脸滤镜的视觉质量和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸滤镜在遮挡情况下性能下降，需要一种能够精细分离遮挡物和面部区域的方法。

Method: FaceMat采用两阶段训练流程，教师模型通过负对数似然损失估计alpha遮罩和像素级不确定性，学生模型通过空间自适应知识蒸馏学习。

Result: FaceMat在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，适用于实时应用。

Conclusion: FaceMat通过无辅助输入的设计和明确的遮罩目标，显著提升了人脸滤镜在遮挡场景下的表现。

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

*Lekang Wen,Jing Xiao,Liang Liao,Jiajun Chen,Mi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出CHARM框架，通过互补学习实现模态间的协同和谐，而非同质化，显著提升多模态语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过特征对齐实现模态同质化，但削弱了各模态的独特优势及其互补性。

Method: 提出CHARM框架，包含Mutual Perception Unit（MPU）实现隐式对齐，以及双路径优化策略（CoL和InE）。

Result: 实验表明CHARM在多个数据集和骨干网络上优于基线，尤其在脆弱模态上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: CHARM将焦点从同质化转向和谐化，实现了多样性的真正互补。

Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene
understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods
typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,
which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

Conclusion: CORE-ReID框架通过集成融合和特征优化，有效解决了域适应问题，成为行人ReID领域的先进解决方案。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,
Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution
for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSFMamba是一种基于Mamba的对称驱动空间-频率特征融合网络，用于3D医学图像分割，通过双分支架构和Mamba块融合空间与频率域特征，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D医学图像分割中未能充分利用频率域信息的独特性质（如共轭对称性）及其与空间域的数据分布差异，导致全局上下文建模不足。

Method: 提出SSFMamba，采用双分支架构分别提取空间和频率域特征，利用Mamba块融合异构特征，并设计3D多方向扫描机制增强局部与全局线索融合。

Result: 在BraTS2020和BraTS2023数据集上的实验表明，SSFMamba在多项评估指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSFMamba通过有效融合空间与频率域特征，显著提升了3D医学图像分割的性能，尤其在全局上下文建模方面表现突出。

Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context
in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出RobustGS模块，提升3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在恶劣成像条件下的鲁棒性，无需逐场景优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前馈3DGS方法假设输入多视图图像干净高质量，但实际场景中图像常受噪声、低光或雨等影响，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 引入通用退化学习器和语义感知状态空间模型，增强退化感知能力并优化特征空间中的输入。

Result: 实验表明，RobustGS模块可无缝集成现有方法，在各种退化条件下实现最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: RobustGS显著提升了前馈3DGS在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性和重建质量。

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注人口属性（如种族、性别）的公平性，但更广泛的属性公平性尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）构建开放集偏见属性知识库，评估LVLMs在细粒度属性上的公平性。

Result: LVLMs在多种属性上表现出偏见，文化、环境、行为因素对决策的影响超过传统人口属性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLMs公平性的新维度，强调了非人口属性因素的重要性。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

Conclusion: $C^2Aug$通过增加伪袋多样性和对比学习框架，显著提升了模型性能，尤其在肿瘤区域较小的测试样本上表现更优。

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分类系统需要适应动态变化的临床环境，现有方法仅依赖简单的文本模板，忽略了更丰富的语义信息。

Method: 动态构建视觉概念池，结合相似性过滤机制，并通过跨模态图像-概念注意力模块和注意力损失整合概念。

Result: 在医学和自然图像数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效且优越，代码将公开。

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在数据效率、优势消失和均匀信用分配上的不足。

Method: 采用离策略训练架构和时序优势塑造策略。

Result: 在多个基准上表现优异，样本效率提升35%以上。

Conclusion: AVATAR在多模态视频推理任务中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

Motivation: 现有少样本学习方法依赖纠缠表示，需从有限监督中隐式恢复解耦过程，阻碍有效适应。基于CLIP的多模态对比学习可解耦潜在表示，启发提出CCA框架。

Method: CCA通过独立成分分析显式解耦CLIP视觉特征，并通过单向（微调文本分类器）和双向（跨注意力机制）增强跨模态对齐，结合单模态和跨模态分类输出提升准确性。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上的实验表明，CCA在少样本性能和分布偏移鲁棒性上优于现有方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: CCA通过显式解耦和跨模态对齐增强，显著提升了少样本学习的适应能力和性能。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

Conclusion: H3R通过混合方法实现了高性能的3D重建，支持多视图输入并具有跨数据集泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and

Conclusion: Landsat30-AU数据集为卫星图像与语言交互提供了重要资源，并展示了模型优化的潜力。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ
large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic
dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building
scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve
the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and
scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting
real fire data. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的图像编辑框架UniEdit-I，通过理解、编辑和验证三个迭代步骤，为统一视觉语言模型（VLM）提供图像编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管统一VLM在视觉理解和生成任务上表现优异，但其图像编辑能力尚未被充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: UniEdit-I通过三个步骤实现图像编辑：1）理解步骤生成源提示和目标提示；2）编辑步骤引入时间自适应偏移；3）验证步骤检查对齐并提供反馈。

Result: 基于BLIP3-o实现的方法在GEdit-Bench基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: UniEdit-I为统一VLM提供了一种无需训练的高保真图像编辑解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARD是一种基于扩散的异常合成框架，通过区域约束扩散和判别性掩模指导，提升空间控制能力和区域保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散方法在空间控制和区域保真度上表现不足，需改进以增强工业异常检测系统的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出SARD框架，结合区域约束扩散（RCD）和判别性掩模指导（DMG），选择性更新异常区域并评估全局和局部保真度。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和BTAD数据集上，SARD在分割精度和视觉质量上超越现有方法，达到新最优水平。

Conclusion: SARD通过改进扩散过程，显著提升了异常合成的空间精确性和区域保真度，为工业应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for
enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent
diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling
complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的高效图像编辑方法LORE，通过优化反转噪声解决了现有方法在泛化和可控性上的核心限制，显著提升了语义对齐、图像质量和背景保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于反转流的图像编辑方法在语义差异较大的情况下存在结构性问题，导致编辑失败或非目标区域意外修改。

Method: 引入LORE方法，直接优化反转噪声，无需架构修改或模型微调。

Result: 在PIEBench、SmartEdit和GapEdit三个基准测试中，LORE在语义对齐、图像质量和背景保真度上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LORE通过潜在空间优化实现了稳定、可控和通用的图像编辑，展示了其有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content
through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

TL;DR: ChartCap是一个包含56.5万张真实图表图像的数据集，通过四阶段流程生成高质量、无幻觉的图表描述，并提出新的视觉一致性评分指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表数据集存在无关信息和结构元素不足的问题，导致视觉语言模型生成图表描述时准确性和信息量不足。

Method: 设计四阶段流程生成仅基于图表可识别数据的描述，并采用循环一致性人工验证加速质量控制。

Result: 实验表明，基于ChartCap微调的模型生成的描述更准确、信息更丰富，幻觉更少，优于开源、专有模型及人工标注。

Conclusion: ChartCap通过高质量数据集和新指标，显著提升了图表描述的生成质量。

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LVLMs在视觉-文本理解上取得突破，但幻觉问题限制了其实际应用，尤其是风格化图像带来的风险。

Method: 构建了一个包含摄影图像和风格化版本的数据集，提出SAVER机制，利用早期层反馈动态调整输出。

Result: 实验表明，风格化图像比摄影图像更容易引发幻觉，SAVER在多种任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SAVER能有效减少幻觉，提升LVLMs在风格化图像中的表现。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware
Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs'
final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging
early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art
performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and
tasks.

Result: 在多样数据集上验证了方法的鲁棒性，渲染质量高且速度提升1.5至4倍，排序开销减少52.2%至86.9%。

Conclusion: Duplex-GS框架显著提升了3D高斯点渲染的效率和质量，适用于多尺度和大规模场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT
based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix
sort overhead without quality degradation.

Motivation: 单目深度估计因从单一视图恢复3D结构的固有模糊性而具有挑战性，需要结合局部和全局线索以提高准确性。

Method: 提出GLKAM模块利用大核卷积和门控机制捕捉多尺度局部信息，GBPM模块估计全局深度分布并提供结构指导。

Result: 在NYU-V2和KITTI数据集上表现优于现有方法，验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合局部和全局线索的方法显著提升了单目深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D
structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can
produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于KAN的持续人脸伪造检测框架（KAN-CFD），通过改进KAN的局部可塑性和特征分离策略，解决了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>

Motivation: 人脸伪造技术的快速发展要求检测器持续适应新方法，但现有方法在学习新类型时容易遗忘旧类型（灾难性遗忘）。KAN的局部可塑性为解决这一问题提供了可能，但其在高维图像建模和特征重叠方面存在局限。

Method: 提出KAN-CFD框架，包括Domain-Group KAN Detector（DG-KD）和数据无关的特征分离策略FS-KDCP。DG-KD使KAN适应高维图像输入，FS-KDCP避免输入空间重叠。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少遗忘的同时实现了优越的性能。

Conclusion: KAN-CFD通过改进KAN的局部可塑性和特征分离策略，有效解决了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，为人脸伪造检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 湿性年龄相关性黄斑变性（wet AMD）是全球致盲的主要原因，其关键特征是脉络膜新生血管（CNV）。OCTA图像的分割对临床评估至关重要，但现有方法面临形状不规则、伪影和数据集缺乏等挑战。

Method: 提出MTG-Net网络，结合多任务框架和两个图模块（MIGR和MRGR），通过图机制探索语义和几何约束，并使用不确定性加权损失减少噪声影响。

Result: MTG-Net在区域分割和血管分割上分别达到87.21%和88.12%的Dice分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTG-Net通过多任务和图机制有效解决了CNV分割的挑战，为wet AMD的临床评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

Method: 提出AlignCAT框架，包含粗粒度对齐模块（利用类别信息和全局上下文）和细粒度对齐模块（利用描述性信息和词级文本特征）。

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+和RefCOCOg三个基准测试中表现优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: AlignCAT通过充分利用语言线索，逐步过滤未对齐的视觉查询，提升了对比学习效率。

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

Motivation: 当前方法依赖视觉语言模型，但图像级预训练与细粒度区域级交互检测不匹配，且文本描述编码效果不佳。

Result: 在SWIG-HOI和HICO-DET数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: INP-CC通过动态提示和概念校准有效提升了开放词汇HOI检测性能。

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities
across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve
inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o）能够从公开共享的图像中推断用户位置，地理隐私面临重大风险。现有对抗扰动方法在高分辨率图像和低扰动预算下效果不佳，且可能引入无关语义内容。

Method: GeoShield包含三个模块：特征解耦模块分离地理和非地理信息，曝光元素识别模块定位图像中的地理泄露区域，尺度自适应增强模块联合优化全局和局部扰动。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GeoShield在黑盒设置下显著优于现有方法，以最小视觉或语义影响实现强隐私保护。

Conclusion: GeoShield是首个针对高级视觉语言模型地理推断的对抗扰动防御方案，为解决日益严重的隐私问题提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

Method: 提出UAA框架，通过离线预计算通用变换，在训练时高效生成独特对抗性扰动，实现高效且鲁棒的防御。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，UAA表现出色，成为数据增强对抗防御的新SOTA，且无需训练时在线生成对抗样本。

Conclusion: UAA为构建鲁棒模型提供了高效实用的解决方案，代码已公开。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code

*Shanshan Guo,Xiwen Liang,Junfan Lin,Yuzheng Zhuang,Liang Lin,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的机器人操作中，低层动作估计的低精度是性能的主要限制因素。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，ActionSink比现有最佳方法提升了7.9%的成功率，在LIBERO-Long任务中提升了近8%的准确率。

Conclusion: ActionSink通过自监督的动作流和动态集成机制，显著提升了机器人操作的精确性，为学习型机器人操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT)方法，通过增强高斯表示和自适应密度控制，解决2D到3D分割中的不一致性问题，提升分割边界清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在2D到3D分割中存在视角间不一致和噪声边界问题，忽视语义线索对高斯学习的优化作用。

Method: 引入GIT，通过实例权重矩阵识别并修正2D分割不一致性，结合自适应密度控制机制优化高斯分布。

Result: 实验表明，GIT能提取干净的3D资产，并在多种设置下提升3D分割效果，支持分层分割、对象提取等应用。

Conclusion: GIT通过语义一致性和密度控制，显著改善了2D和3D分割的边界质量，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastInit提出了一种快速噪声初始化方法，通过单次前向传播生成高质量视频噪声，显著提升生成效率和时序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成方法（如FreeInit）需要迭代优化噪声，计算成本高，FastInit旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FastInit训练了一个视频噪声预测网络（VNPNet），通过单次前向传播生成优化后的噪声，无需迭代。

Result: 实验表明，FastInit显著提升了生成视频的质量和时序一致性，同时降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: FastInit为视频生成提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，可直接应用于推理阶段。

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法需要大量标注数据和计算资源，限制了纳米颗粒研究中的可访问性。

Method: 结合Segment Anything Model (SAM)进行对象分割和DINOv2进行特征嵌入，辅以轻量级分类器，实现高精度形状分类。

Result: 方法在三个形态多样的纳米颗粒数据集上表现优于微调的YOLOv11和ChatGPT o4-mini-high基线，对小数据集和形态变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基础模型为自动化显微镜图像分析提供了高效且易用的替代方案，推动了纳米颗粒研究的进展。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product
quality in nanomaterial synthesis and accelerating development. However,
conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive
labeled datasets and computationally demanding training, limiting their
accessibility to the typical nanoparticle practitioner in research and
industrial settings. In this study, we introduce a zero-shot classification
pipeline that leverages two vision foundation models: the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for object segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding. By
combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision
shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets
- without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology
outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines,
demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations,
and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering
metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of
assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the
potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis,
offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle
research which is both more efficient and more accessible to the user.

TL;DR: 论文提出了FFHQ-Makeup数据集，通过改进的化妆迁移方法生成高质量的面部化妆配对图像，填补了现有数据集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中收集高质量化妆配对图像困难，现有合成方法存在失真或身份不一致问题。

Method: 基于FFHQ数据集，改进化妆迁移方法，分离身份与化妆风格，生成18K身份各配5种化妆风格的90K图像对。

Result: 构建了FFHQ-Makeup数据集，包含90K高质量化妆配对图像，保持身份和表情一致性。

Conclusion: FFHQ-Makeup填补了高质量化妆配对数据集的空白，为美容相关任务提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVTOP是一种基于Transformer的多视角刚性物体姿态估计方法，通过早期融合视角特征解决单视角无法解决的姿态模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视角或后处理单视角姿态无法解决的姿态模糊问题，提供一种更可靠的多视角姿态估计方法。

Method: 通过视线建模多视角几何，融合多视角信息，无需额外数据（如深度），端到端可训练。

Result: 在合成数据集上优于单视角和现有多视角方法，在YCB-V数据集上表现竞争性。

Conclusion: MVTOP是首个能可靠解决姿态模糊问题的全视角方法，具有通用性和高效性。

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多步迭代推理或预训练扩散先验，效率受限。RSDNet旨在通过单步推理和潜在空间去噪解决这一问题。

Method: RSDNet利用多级去噪自编码器（DAEs）在潜在特征空间学习去噪过程，并引入语义-几何条件引导增强稀疏表示。DLF支持多类型多级噪声样本生成。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，RSDNet表现优于现有方法，达到最先进的检测性能。

Conclusion: RSDNet通过单步推理和潜在空间去噪实现了高效且鲁棒的3D目标检测，为稀疏检测任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

Motivation: 在资源受限环境中部署T2V模型时，降低其高计算成本是关键，但现有蒸馏方法易导致模式崩溃。

Conclusion: ReDPO和V.I.P.框架能高效生成高质量视频，为资源受限环境提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

TL;DR: DiffBrush是一种基于扩散的模型，用于生成手写文本行，通过内容解耦风格学习和多尺度内容学习，显著提升了风格模仿和内容准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手写文本生成方法主要关注孤立单词，而实际手写文本需要关注单词间关系（如垂直对齐和水平间距），因此生成整行文本更具挑战性和实用性。

Method: DiffBrush采用两种策略：内容解耦风格学习（通过列和行掩码分离风格与内容）和多尺度内容学习（使用行和单词鉴别器确保全局一致性和局部准确性）。

Result: 实验表明，DiffBrush在生成高质量文本行方面表现出色，尤其在风格再现和内容保留上。

Conclusion: DiffBrush通过创新的方法解决了手写文本行生成的挑战，为实际应用提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

Result: 在Ego4D、EPIC-Kitchens和EGTEA数据集上，EgoPrompt实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EgoPrompt通过捕捉组件间关系，显著提升了动作识别的泛化能力和表现。

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and
base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

Conclusion: BaroPoser通过结合气压计数据显著提升了姿态估计和全局平移的准确性，尤其在复杂地形中表现突出。

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based
detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation).
We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis
of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the
evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and
guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

*Yufei Xue,Yushi Huang,Jiawei Shao,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对视觉语言模型（VLM）的重要性感知后训练量化框架VLMQ，解决了现有方法因模态差异导致的性能下降问题，并在低比特量化下取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Hessian的后训练量化方法在处理视觉语言模型时，因未考虑模态差异（文本令牌有限而视觉令牌冗余）导致性能严重下降。

Method: VLMQ通过优化重要性感知目标生成增强的Hessian矩阵，并结合轻量级块级反向传播计算令牌级重要性因子，同时保持并行化权重更新的兼容性。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，VLMQ在0.5B∼32B规模的VLM上表现出色，尤其在低比特量化下（如2比特）实现了16.45%的性能提升。

Conclusion: VLMQ为视觉语言模型的后训练量化提供了高效且有效的解决方案，显著提升了低比特量化下的性能。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCFlow提出了一种通过可逆合并风格与内容的方法，避免显式解耦，利用流匹配框架实现自然解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以明确解耦风格与内容，SCFlow尝试通过可逆合并任务实现自然解耦。

Method: SCFlow基于流匹配框架，训练合并风格与内容的任务，无需显式监督，利用合成数据集进行验证。

Result: SCFlow在ImageNet-1k和WikiArt上表现出色，零样本设置下性能优越。

Conclusion: SCFlow证明解耦可通过可逆合并自然实现，无需显式监督。

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores
the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe
operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous
advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these
small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets
have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more
extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for
long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here
the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516
meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released
previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater
variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for
drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target
range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop
algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object
detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在参数规模、自我修正能力和复杂推理任务上表现不足，尤其在长视觉上下文和文档任务中。

Method: MACT包含四个小规模智能体（规划、执行、判断、回答），通过混合奖励建模和智能体级测试时扩展优化协作。

Result: MACT在15个基准测试中的13个领先，且在长视觉上下文和复杂推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: MACT以较小参数规模实现了高性能，适用于通用和数学任务，同时显著提升了文档任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

Motivation: 自回归扩散模型在长视频生成中因时间漂移和并行化困难而受限，需改进。

Method: 采用两阶段规划（微观和宏观）生成全局故事线，并行填充内容，优化GPU调度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在质量和稳定性上优于现有长视频生成模型。

Conclusion: MMPL框架有效解决了长视频生成中的关键问题，提升了生成效率和质量。

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督视频分割任务缺乏监督信号且场景复杂，现有方法依赖大模型，计算成本高。因此，提出一种简单高效的知识蒸馏框架。

Method: 提出SlotMatch框架，通过余弦相似度对齐师生模型的表示，无需额外目标或监督。

Result: 学生模型性能优于教师模型（SlotContrast），参数减少3.6倍，速度提升1.9倍，且超越其他无监督视频分割模型。

Conclusion: SlotMatch证明了简单知识蒸馏框架的有效性，为无监督视频分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阶段方法，通过残差傅里叶引导模块（RFGM）和Mamba模块，高效恢复极暗图像中的细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在恢复暗图像细节时效果不佳，无法保留精细结构和边缘，影响下游应用。

Method: 第一阶段使用RFGM在频域恢复全局光照；第二阶段通过Patch Mamba和Grad Mamba模块细化纹理结构。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和下游应用中显著提升细节恢复性能，同时保持高效。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量且易于集成到现有框架中，有效解决了暗图像细节恢复的挑战。

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

Result: 在 Horse2Zebra、Monet2Photo 和 Strike-off 数据集上表现优于基线方法，具有更好的感知质量、更快的收敛速度和更高的模式多样性。

Conclusion: Fd-CycleGAN 通过频率引导的潜在学习显著提升了图像翻译任务的泛化能力，适用于文档修复、艺术风格迁移和医学图像合成等领域。

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频问答中因高计算成本受限，现有方法存在帧冗余问题。

Method: AFP采用自适应层次聚类算法在融合特征空间中剪枝冗余帧，并引入轻量级语义图补充信息。

Result: 实验显示AFP减少帧数86.9%，输入标记83.2%，同时提升准确性。

Conclusion: AFP高效且性能优越，为视频问答提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source

TL;DR: 提出CIVQLLIE框架，通过离散表示学习和因果干预解决低光图像增强问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像可见性差，现有方法缺乏解释性或依赖不可靠先验，物理方法假设过于简化。

Method: 利用向量量化（VQ）学习离散视觉标记，通过多级因果干预（PCI、FCI、HDRM）校正分布偏移。

Result: 框架在低光条件下显著提升图像质量，增强细节和颜色准确性。

Conclusion: CIVQLLIE结合离散表示和因果干预，有效解决低光图像增强的挑战。

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

Conclusion: IMAC通过创新的时空对齐和插值策略，有效解决了EEG跨域数据偏移问题，具有高鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

*Junlong Ren,Gangjian Zhang,Honghao Fu,Pengcheng Wu,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaMo是一种基于小波的多频率特征提取框架，用于解决文本-运动检索中的语义对齐问题，通过分解和重建运动信号实现细粒度对齐，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在匹配3D运动与文本时忽视了人体结构的复杂性和时空动态性，导致语义对齐不精确。

Method: WaMo包含三个关键组件：轨迹小波分解、轨迹小波重建和无序运动序列预测，通过多分辨率特征提取实现细粒度对齐。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上，WaMo的Rsum分别提高了17.0%和18.2%，优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: WaMo通过小波分解和重建技术有效捕捉运动细节，显著提升了文本-运动检索的性能。

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VideoGuard的视频保护方法，通过引入微小扰动防止生成模型对视频进行恶意编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成技术的快速发展可能导致恶意滥用，现有方法对视频内容的保护不足。

Method: 采用联合帧优化和视频运动信息融合，干扰生成扩散模型的功能。

Result: VideoGuard的保护性能优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: VideoGuard能有效防止视频被未经授权的恶意编辑。

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the
baseline methods.

TL;DR: DrUM是一种新方法，通过条件级建模在潜在空间中整合用户画像，解决了T2I扩散模型中个性化生成的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖提示级建模，由于T2I模型的输入标记容量有限，导致个性化不准确。

Method: DrUM结合用户画像和基于变压器的适配器，实现潜在空间中的条件级建模。

Result: DrUM在大规模数据集上表现优异，并能无缝集成开源文本编码器，兼容主流T2I模型。

Conclusion: DrUM有效解决了T2I扩散模型中的个性化生成问题，无需额外微调。

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

*Matteo Caligiuri,Francesco Barbato,Donald Shenaj,Umberto Michieli,Pietro Zanuttigh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedPromo是一种高效联邦学习框架，通过轻量级代理模型优化，减少客户端计算开销，同时保持隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习方法在大模型上计算资源需求高，客户端设备难以承受，FedPromo旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：服务器端知识蒸馏对齐大模型与紧凑模型表示，客户端训练轻量级分类器并聚合。

Result: 在五个图像分类基准测试中，FedPromo优于现有方法，适用于资源有限的客户端。

Conclusion: FedPromo在性能、隐私和资源效率之间取得平衡，适用于多领域学习。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

TL;DR: 论文提出SODA框架，用于检测生成对象中的隐性人口统计偏见，发现现有模型在生成对象时存在刻板印象和视觉差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究文本到图像生成中对象层面的隐性人口统计偏见，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 引入SODA框架，通过比较中性提示和人口统计提示生成的2700张图像，分析视觉属性差异。

Result: 发现模型生成的对象存在与人口统计相关的视觉刻板印象，部分模型输出多样性较低。

Conclusion: SODA框架为检测和减少生成模型中的刻板印象提供了实用工具，推动更负责任的AI发展。

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的图像修复方法存在高推理成本和适应性差的问题，需要改进。

Method: 引入多退化特征调制和参数高效的低秩适应，结合高保真细节增强模块。

Result: 实验表明，DOD在视觉质量和推理效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DOD是一种高效且适应性强的图像修复方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜微血管成像被广泛用于评估全身血管和代谢健康，但脂质组学与视网膜血管的关系尚不明确。

Method: 采用Spearman相关分析和Benjamini-Hochberg校正，研究脂质亚类与视网膜微血管特征的关联。

Result: FA与血管扭曲相关，CE与动静脉平均宽度相关；DAG和TAG与血管宽度和复杂性呈负相关。

Conclusion: 视网膜血管结构反映特定脂质谱，支持其作为代谢健康的非侵入性标志物，首次在健康人群中结合深度学习与脂质组学。

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

Conclusion: GRASP的双重解剖注入策略有效整合解剖背景，提升病理分割性能。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

Motivation: 传统内窥镜受限于毫米级厚度，而金属透镜（微米级）为超微成像提供了新可能，但数据采集和算法研究存在空白。论文旨在填补这一空白，推动金属透镜内窥镜的发展。

Method: 首先建立金属透镜内窥镜数据集并进行光学模拟，发现两个光学问题；随后提出MetaScope，包含光学驱动的强度调整（OIA）和色差校正（OCC），并通过梯度引导蒸馏增强联合学习。

Result: MetaScope在金属透镜分割和恢复任务中优于现有方法，并在真实生物医学场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MetaScope通过结合物理光学和深度学习，成功解决了金属透镜内窥镜的关键光学问题，为未来应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

Motivation: 解决现有步态识别方法在新数据集上需要重新训练且难以保留历史知识的问题。

Method: 提出GaitAdapter方法，结合GPAK模块和EDSM方法，利用图神经网络聚合步态模式并保持特征空间稳定性。

Result: 实验表明GaitAdapter在保留历史知识的同时显著提升了识别能力。

Conclusion: GaitAdapter是一种有效的持续步态识别方法，能够逐步增强模型性能。

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when
encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter
difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a
significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these
challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt,
which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

Attention Zoom on multiple CNN backbones using CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet,

Motivation: 现有测试时适应（TTA）方法在资源受限场景中计算开销大，且令牌聚合方法直接集成会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出NAVIA方法，通过增强[CLS]令牌嵌入和引入自适应偏置，优化熵最小化以恢复信息损失。

Result: NAVIA在多个分布外基准测试中性能提升超过2.5%，推理延迟降低20%以上。

Conclusion: NAVIA有效解决了ETTA问题，平衡了适应能力和计算效率。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

Result: 在标准基准测试中达到最优性能，显著提升平均rank-1准确率。

Conclusion: DepthGait通过引入深度图和融合方案，显著提升了步态识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

Conclusion: STVMLU通过结合空间相似性和稀疏性约束，显著提高了高光谱解混的精度。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动主动学习在医学图像分析中缺乏高效的特征提取方法，而预训练的Foundation Models（FMs）具有潜力但缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 提出了MedCAL-Bench基准测试，评估了14种FMs和7种CSAL策略在7个数据集上的表现，覆盖分类和分割任务。

Result: 1）大多数FMs是有效的特征提取器，DINO家族在分割任务中表现最佳；2）FMs在分割任务中差异较大，分类任务中差异较小；3）不同数据集需要不同的样本选择策略。

Conclusion: MedCAL-Bench为医学图像分析中的CSAL提供了系统性评估，揭示了FMs和样本选择策略的适用性差异。

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for
classification. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于流的生成模型在图像和视频合成中取得了显著进展，但引导机制在不同采样阶段的交互作用尚不明确，尤其是在快速低步长的情况下。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，发现早期步骤中条件与无条件预测的相对强度（RATIO）存在峰值，提出了一种基于RATIO的自适应引导调度方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了逐步引导适应在快速流式生成模型中的关键作用。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

Conclusion: CoPS通过动态提示和语义融合显著提升了零样本异常检测性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable
performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single
auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on
diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to
manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert
knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following
challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著优于现有图像和视频去摩尔纹技术。

Conclusion: 双摄像头框架有效解决了摩尔纹与真实纹理的区分问题，同时保持了色调和时间一致性。

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely
outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结肠镜视频的动态特性提供了更全面的视觉信息，但快速相机移动会引入背景噪声，增加误检风险。

Method: AVPDN包含自适应特征交互与增强（AFIA）模块和尺度感知上下文集成（SACI）模块，分别用于增强特征表示和多尺度特征整合。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中表现出色，具有竞争性的性能。

Conclusion: AVPDN是一种有效的视频息肉检测框架，能够应对结肠镜视频中的噪声挑战。

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IKOD的解码策略，通过合并短序列的高图像注意力来减轻LVLMs中的幻觉问题，无需额外训练或工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在长序列生成中表现出注意力下降和幻觉增加的问题，但其原因尚不明确。

Method: 分析了视觉注意力与长序列偏差的关系，提出IKOD策略，通过合并高图像注意力的短序列来抑制幻觉。

Result: 实验表明IKOD能有效减少幻觉并提升模型性能，且无需额外成本。

Conclusion: IKOD是一种轻量高效的解决方案，适用于多种LVLMs。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT模型的高计算成本和参数量在资源受限场景中难以应用，现有PTQ方法在极低比特设置下性能下降严重。

Method: 提出LRQ-DiT框架，包括Twin-Log量化（TLQ）和自适应旋转方案（ARS），分别针对权重分布和激活异常问题。

Result: 在PixArt和FLUX等模型上验证，LRQ-DiT在低比特量化下保持了图像质量，优于现有PTQ方法。

Conclusion: LRQ-DiT有效解决了DiT模型量化中的关键问题，为资源受限场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in
text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑行业资源消耗大，回收材料质量监测仍依赖人工方法，需更高效的视觉机器学习解决方案。

Method: 改进分割基础模型（ParticleSAM），创建模拟密集多颗粒数据集，用于自动化质量监控。

Result: 实验证明ParticleSAM优于原始SAM方法，适用于小颗粒分割场景。

Conclusion: ParticleSAM在建筑及其他小颗粒分割领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

TL;DR: 稀疏字典学习（SDL）是图像处理中的基础技术，本文探讨了SDL中稀疏性对恢复质量的影响，发现不同优化方法会导致不同的稀疏性表现，且高稀疏性通常不会损害恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稀疏字典学习中稀疏性对图像恢复质量的影响，以确定稀疏性是否会影响恢复效果。

Method: 通过多种优化方法（如迭代收缩算法）解决SDL中的非光滑优化问题，分析不同方法产生的稀疏性表现。

Result: 不同优化方法会导致不同的稀疏性表现，高稀疏性通常不会损害恢复质量，即使恢复图像与学习数据库差异较大。

Conclusion: 稀疏字典学习中，高稀疏性通常不会影响恢复质量，为图像处理任务提供了灵活性。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

Motivation: 医学数据固有的模糊性和变异性导致现有模型难以捕捉多层次的语义关系，检索结果不可靠。

Method: PECM框架引入多级原型和双流置信度估计，利用原型相似性分布和自适应加权机制。

Result: 在放射学数据集上显著提升检索精度和一致性，性能提升达10.17%。

Conclusion: PECM有效处理数据模糊性，提升了复杂临床场景下的检索可靠性。

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

Conclusion: MAUP为跨域少样本医学图像分割提供了一种高效、无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

Conclusion: DKUA框架有效解决了终身行人重识别的关键挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be
publicly released.

Motivation: 组织样本常大于标准显微镜载玻片，需拼接多片段以分析完整结构（如肿瘤）。传统方法因组织损失、形态变形、染色不一致等问题受限。

Result: 在三个组织病理学数据集上实验表明，SemanticStitcher在正确边界匹配上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher提供了一种鲁棒且高效的全切片拼接方法，显著提升了拼接质量。

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在抽象情感生成上表现不佳，且现有EICG方法过度依赖词级属性标签，存在语义不连贯和可扩展性差的问题。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型构建情感触发内容的高质量描述，设计分层低秩适应模块（HiLoRA）建模情感特征。

Conclusion: CoEmoGen为情感图像生成提供了语义连贯且可扩展的解决方案，并发布了EmoArt数据集以支持情感驱动的艺术创作。

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level
features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic
coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To
intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of
emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for
emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing
diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural
deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic
controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis
approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal
images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个开源的大规模数据集，用于将口语数学表达式转换为LaTeX，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决口语数学表达式转换为LaTeX的挑战，填补现有方法在数据集规模、多语言支持和应用场景上的不足。

Method: 基于ASR后校正模型和音频语言模型，结合少样本提示技术，构建了一个包含66,000个标注样本的数据集。

Result: 在MathSpeech基准测试中CER为28%，在S2L-equations基准测试中显著优于现有模型（27% vs. 64%），并首次建立了数学句子识别的基准。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态AI在数学内容识别领域的未来进展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed
S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a
substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for
LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for
mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER
of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI,
with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

Motivation: 传统野生动物密度估算方法（如捕获-再捕获、距离采样或相机陷阱）劳动密集或空间受限，无人机提供了一种非侵入性且高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用热成像和RGB图像的无人机调查，飞行高度60米，手动标注动物并采用三种外推方法（简单面积外推、自助法和零膨胀负二项模型）估算密度，与相机陷阱的随机相遇模型（REM）对比。

Result: 无人机方法估算的密度与REM相似，通常更高，但10月某一区域例外。无人机反映白天开放和森林区域活动，REM反映长期森林区域平均活动。

Conclusion: 无人机是一种有前景、可扩展的野生动物密度估算方法，与传统方法提供不同视角。

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that
requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在分析农村地区历史地图时计算量大、效率低的问题，以支持历史人口普查验证和废弃聚落定位等研究。

Method: 采用分层机器学习方法：先用CNN分类器过滤掉无建筑物的区域，再用CNN分割算法提取剩余区域的建筑特征。

Result: 在爱尔兰历史地图上验证了流水线的高性能和效率，并发现了一处可能因大饥荒废弃的聚落。

Conclusion: 该方法为历史考古研究提供了高效工具，展示了其在发现历史变迁中的潜力。

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决雷达数据噪声和多路径效应问题，提供隐私保护且不受光照影响的姿态估计方法。

Method: 使用概率编码器-解码器架构，结合变分推断和关键点回归，预测3D关节位置及不确定性。

Result: 在光学动作捕捉数据集上，平均关节位置误差为6.425 cm，不确定性校准误差为0.021，数据增强效果显著。

Conclusion: RadProPoser是首个端到端雷达姿态估计系统，为可靠的人体运动分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

Result: 在13个多样化基准测试中显著提升了精度和mAP，同时保持了计算效率和推理速度。

Conclusion: DyCAF-Net因其适应性强，成为医学影像、监控和自动驾驶等实际检测任务的稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

Motivation: 云层和夜间条件限制了多光谱卫星图像的可用性，而Sentinel-1雷达数据不受这些限制。

Method: 采用基于条件潜在流匹配的多阶段训练方法，并首次将余弦调度与流匹配结合。

Result: CloudBreaker在生成光学图像上表现出色（FID为0.7432），NDWI和NDVI的结构相似性指数分别为0.6156和0.6874。

Conclusion: CloudBreaker为多光谱数据不可靠的应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach
based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural
similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide
range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically
unavailable or unreliable

Conclusion: evTransFER框架通过迁移学习和新架构设计，显著提升了事件相机在表情识别中的性能。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

Abstract: We introduce FPG-NAS, a FLOPs-aware Gated Differentiable Neural Architecture
Search framework for efficient 6DoF object pose estimation. Estimating 3D
rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet
remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in
resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a
specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a
task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables
discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural
diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search
space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures.
Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived

of our knowledge, FPG-NAS is the first differentiable NAS framework
specifically designed for 6DoF object pose estimation.

Conclusion: Uni3R为可泛化的统一3D场景重建和理解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D
scene reconstruction and understanding. The code is available at

propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose

completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by
the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented
as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models
for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the
joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling
performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website:

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种布局引导的LiDAR生成模型（La La LiDAR），通过语义增强的场景图扩散和前景感知控制注入，实现可控的LiDAR场景生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型缺乏对前景对象和空间关系的显式控制，限制了其在场景模拟和安全验证中的应用。

Method: 采用语义增强的场景图扩散和关系感知的上下文条件，结合前景感知控制注入，生成结构化LiDAR布局和完整场景。

Result: 实验表明，La La LiDAR在LiDAR生成和下游感知任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: La La LiDAR为可控3D场景生成设定了新基准。

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models
achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over
foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for
scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we
propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a
novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced
scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for
structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control
injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over
object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support
our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two
large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for
layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception
tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

TL;DR: LiDARCrafter是一个统一的4D LiDAR生成和编辑框架，通过自然语言输入生成动态场景，解决了可控性、时间一致性和评估标准化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成世界模型多关注视频或占用网格，忽略了LiDAR特性，动态4D LiDAR建模面临可控性、时间一致性和评估标准化的挑战。

Method: 利用自然语言输入解析为场景图，通过三分支扩散网络生成对象结构、运动轨迹和几何形状，结合自回归模块生成时间一致的4D LiDAR序列。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，LiDARCrafter在保真度、可控性和时间一致性方面达到最优性能。

Conclusion: LiDARCrafter为数据增强和仿真提供了新途径，代码和基准测试已开源。

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation
and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongVie是一个端到端的自回归框架，用于可控的长视频生成，解决了现有方法在时间一致性和视觉质量上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成长视频时存在时间不一致和视觉退化的问题，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: LongVie采用统一的噪声初始化策略、全局控制信号归一化、多模态控制框架和退化感知训练策略。

Result: LongVie在长范围可控性、一致性和质量上达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: LongVie通过创新的设计解决了长视频生成的挑战，并展示了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,
complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively
balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also
introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100
high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,
each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and
quality.

Motivation: 视频理解需要有效建模运动和外观信息，尤其是在少样本动作识别中。现有方法在点跟踪方面有进展，但仍面临选择信息点和建模运动模式的挑战。

Method: 1. 语义感知采样策略，根据物体尺度和语义相关性自适应分布跟踪点。2. 运动建模框架，通过HoD捕捉轨迹内动态和轨迹间关系。

Result: 在六个少样本动作识别基准测试（Something-Something-V2、Kinetics、UCF101、HMDB51和FineGym）中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Trokens通过结合语义感知采样和运动建模，显著提升了少样本动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance
information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent
advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action
recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points
to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a
novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action
recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),
Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym. For project page see

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM代理系统成本高、难以扩展的问题，探索如何在降低成本的同时不牺牲性能。

Method: 通过实证分析GAIA基准，评估LLM主干选择、代理框架设计和测试时扩展策略的影响，提出Efficient Agents框架。

Result: Efficient Agents在保持96.7%性能的同时，将成本从$0.398降至$0.228，成本效率提升28.4%。

Conclusion: 研究为设计高效、高性能的代理系统提供了实用指导，推动了AI解决方案的可及性和可持续性。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility
and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需领域闭包假设（DCA）的规划方法，适用于对象动态变化的场景，并证明了其完备性和正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规划问题假设对象集合固定（DCA），但实际应用中对象可能动态变化，需要新的规划方法。

Method: 基于一阶逻辑建模，限制计划长度，并在规划时对动作序列进行实例化搜索。

Result: 证明了方法的完备性和正确性，适用于无DCA的有限规划问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态对象规划问题提供了可行解决方案，并通过概念验证实现展示了潜力。

Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are
finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in
actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,
there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes
dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old
objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order
logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,
discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely
many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,
and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at
planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can
be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the
intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and
conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent
literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VSNIT的新方法，用于从稀疏的LBS数据中恢复不完整的活动序列，效果优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LBS数据的稀疏性导致活动序列不完整，难以准确推断出行和活动，因此需要一种方法来恢复缺失的序列。

Method: 结合Insertion Transformer的灵活序列构建能力和Variable Selection Network的动态协变量处理能力，提出VSNIT模型。

Result: VSNIT能插入更多样化、真实的模式，更有效地恢复活动序列，性能显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VSNIT在活动序列恢复任务中表现出色，为LBS数据在移动性分析中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human
mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences,
making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a
research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS
data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This
study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion
Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence
construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling
capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while
preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,
realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and
restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the
target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across
all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in
activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS
data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework
for future location-based research and applications.

Motivation: 现有AI框架在科学发现中缺乏透明性和可操控性，科学家需要更精准的推理控制工具。

Result: CLIO使GPT-4.1在HLE测试中的准确率提升13.82%，揭示了内部不确定性波动对结果的影响。

Conclusion: CLIO的开放设计为科学决策提供了透明性和控制力，展现了AI在科学发现中的潜力。

Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test
altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition
that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape
falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that
natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that
abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While
powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,
they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also
steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and
precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ
optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to
self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when
self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief
or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty
levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph
structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,
OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology
and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net
or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and
surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We
further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are
key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open
design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific
decision-making processes.

Conclusion: 多代理方法在需要复杂推理的可解释和可信赖临床AI应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to
questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While
recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA,
they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal
misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support
complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding,
multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a
challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising
consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM
baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.
This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support
explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准测试无法准确衡量基础模型和智能体的规划能力，要么任务定义模糊，要么依赖国际规划竞赛的问题。

Method: 提出一种围绕Countdown游戏的规划基准测试生成方法，该问题具有自然语言描述、计算复杂性（NP完全）和丰富的实例空间。

Result: 理论分析证明了计算复杂性，实例生成方法优于公共基准测试，现有LLM辅助规划方法在该动态基准上表现不佳。

Conclusion: Countdown基准测试为评估规划能力提供了更有效的工具，现有LLM方法仍需改进。

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one
of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the
existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their
planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined
tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems
from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to
formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and
challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered
around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target
number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss
how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal
benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows
for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is
computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich
enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive
theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and
demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public
benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on
instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other
domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic
benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够高效评估渗透测试代理操作的系统，解决传统程序化评估不切实际的问题。

Method: 使用树状结构将渗透测试任务分解为更小的子任务和简单标准，利用LLM作为评分工具，并与人类专家评分对比。

Result: 最佳模型F1得分为0.83，工具使用能力强的模型更接近人类专家评分，不同模型在不同类型问题上表现各异。

Conclusion: PentestJudge展示了LLM在评估渗透测试代理操作中的潜力，验证比生成更容易，为未来研究提供了方法论支持。

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of
penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model
(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary
trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a
security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be
impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree
structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a
particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and
criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for
PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories
related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.
LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth
reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard
binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier
and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an
F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more
closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we
find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of
questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular
operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the
trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,
suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration
testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in
understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the
process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be
confidently used in sensitive production environments.

Result: 初步实验表明，AQUAH能完成冷启动模拟并生成分析师就绪的文档，结果被专家评为清晰、透明且物理合理。

Conclusion: 尽管需进一步校准和验证，但AQUAH展示了基于LLM和视觉的代理在简化复杂环境建模中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed
specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language
prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to
2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge
data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a
self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large
language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key
decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty
commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH
can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation
without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear,
transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation
are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the
promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex
environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data,
physics-based tools, and decision makers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生对AI工具的采用非常谨慎，模型在简单感知任务上的错误会阻碍其临床应用。因此，需要评估MLMs在这些任务上的表现。

Method: Medblink包含8个临床相关任务，涵盖多种成像模式和解剖区域，共1,429道选择题和1,605张图像。评估了19种先进MLMs。

Result: 人类标注者准确率为96.4%，而最佳模型仅达到65%，表明当前MLMs在常规感知任务上表现不足。

Conclusion: 当前MLMs的视觉基础能力需加强，以支持其临床采用。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support
and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical
image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI
tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as
determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is

Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual
abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple
imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice
questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including
general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo,
LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the
best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs
frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen
their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our

*Chia-Tung Ho,Jing Gong,Xufeng Yao,Yunsheng Bai,Abhishek B Akkur,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Polymath是一种自优化的智能代理，通过动态分层工作流解决现实世界中的动态问题，无需标记数据，性能提升8.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于标记数据的工作流生成方法在动态问题中效果不佳，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 结合任务流图的灵活性和代码表示的工作流，采用多网格图优化和自反思进化算法优化工作流。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上平均性能提升8.1%。

Conclusion: Polymath为动态问题提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing
agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations.
Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models
into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT
through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many
researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these
workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often
rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them
ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where
labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath,
a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the
flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented
workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed
optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with
a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without
labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding,
math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 通过引入元认知和仲裁模块，使LLM能够自主评估和调节输出。

Result: 在七个先进LLM上测试，防御成功率显著提升，部分模型在增强模式下接近完美防御。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量且高效，适用于多平台GenAI用例，平衡了防御成功率和计算开销。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's
inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a
framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling
LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is
evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and
Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate
significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and
computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight,
cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for
GenAI use cases across various platforms.

Result: 代码减少60-80%，性能提升达3.1倍，完全兼容现有函数调用标准。

Conclusion: 为工具集成架构提供理论见解，并为实际LLM应用开发提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created
a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,
manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this
challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts
protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution
demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce
development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent
execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show
60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up
to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing
function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights
into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM
application development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs能力和自主性的提升，评估其输出（尤其是开放性和复杂任务）成为关键瓶颈，需要新的评估方法。

Result: 展示了该范式在医疗、法律、金融和教育等领域的实际应用，并指出其潜力与局限性。

Conclusion: 基于代理的评估可以补充（但不能替代）人类监督，为下一代LLMs的可信、可扩展评估提供了方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating
their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical
bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators
themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and
perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other
models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this
review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from
single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically
examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across
reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in
domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight
pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline
future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review
demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human
oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for
next-generation LLMs.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在交互式环境中多轮代理规划的两大挑战：信用分配问题和计算开销问题。

Method: 提出BPO三阶段框架：引导（使用规划四元组和长短链思维融合）、外推（通过复杂度分层课程学习）、优化（奖励门控拒绝采样选择经验）。

Result: 在ALFWorld、ScienceWorld和WebShop上实现最先进性能，并显著提高令牌效率。

Conclusion: BPO为代理规划中的推理模型提供了新的解决方案，适用于长时程稀疏奖励环境。

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的MILP方法独立处理各模块的策略学习，忽略了模块间的相互依赖，影响了求解效率和质量。

Method: 将MILP求解中的割平面选择和分支协作建模为Stackelberg博弈，采用两阶段学习范式（数据通信预训练和模块策略协同优化）稳定策略学习。

Result: 在合成和大规模真实MILP数据集上，联合学习的策略显著提升了求解性能，并展现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Collab-Solver通过多智能体协作学习框架有效解决了MILP求解中模块策略协同优化的问题，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in
combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of
hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain
knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is
devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies.
Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing
worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without
considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and
quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy
learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize
the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration
of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under
this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the
collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the
data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates
the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy
significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and
large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by
Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across
different instance sets.

Result: GPT-2能学习元ODE算法，性能优于欧拉方法，且随着示例增加精度呈指数提升，还能泛化到分布外问题。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ICL在解决非线性数值问题中的潜力，为理解其机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few
examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for
NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying
mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE
problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on
these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively
learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better
than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing
numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation
capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms
of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

Method: 提出ToR框架，采用树结构记录推理路径和临床证据，并设计交叉验证机制确保多智能体决策一致性。

Result: 在真实医疗数据上的实验表明，该框架性能优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ToR框架通过结构化推理和交叉验证，显著提升了复杂医疗场景下的临床推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical
domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex
medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack
sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps
when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to
diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning
(ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios.
Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the
reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same
time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of
multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability
of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on
real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance
than existing baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖浅层模式匹配，难以应对新型攻击策略，因此需要更通用的防御机制。

Method: CDD框架结合全局感知和局部分析，通过监督微调和熵引导的强化学习（EG-GRPO）识别和应对攻击。

Result: 实验表明CDD在防御性能和泛化能力上达到最优水平。

Conclusion: CDD为LLM的安全部署提供了有效的防御方案，尤其适用于未知攻击。

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential
for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow
pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack
strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense
(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by
applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful
intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning
chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a
localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised
fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason
about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,
an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to
encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments
demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and
exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

Motivation: 探索开源大语言模型在法律领域的潜力，满足本地部署需求并保护数据隐私。

Result: 专有模型表现更优，开源模型需改进；推理模式影响输出；模型量化牺牲性能。

Conclusion: 开源模型需针对性优化，ContractEval为法律领域LLM发展提供基准。

Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as
legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in
locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data
confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to
thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in
identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the
Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15
open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary
models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output
effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain
specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,
though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning
("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely
due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no
related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are
present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting
relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of
performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These
findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior
legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure
correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval
offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

Result: 在三个任务中，AHSD方法性能提升高达60%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AHSD通过互补启发式集合显著提升了自动启发式设计的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing
approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances,
often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings.
To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new
formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a
small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances,
such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in
this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and
supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the
AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary
population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could
effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.
Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances
spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\%
performance improvements.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data
imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved

diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and
variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings.
To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional
diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for
tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it
also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

Conclusion: T2UE实现了零接触数据保护，仅需文本描述即可保护数据隐私。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of
misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research
proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes
beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies
claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses
information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete
verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three
core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,
Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative
reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented
by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning
contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of
communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided
into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that
generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest
accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study
provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and
inspire smart education models.

*Vinicius Lima,Dzung T. Phan,Jayant Kalagnanam,Dhaval Patel,Nianjun Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过可验证合成数据生成管道训练可信赖大型语言模型（LLM）代理的框架，专注于线性和混合整数线性规划，实现了从自然语言到求解器代码的多阶段翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建可靠且可验证的LLM代理，以解决现实世界中的优化问题，确保数据质量和模型性能。

Method: 通过结构化符号表示生成自然语言描述、数学公式和求解器可执行代码，利用教师模型生成逐步演示，并通过多数投票交叉验证进行多语言推理。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠LLM代理提供了可扩展、可验证且原则性的路径，适用于实际优化应用。

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM)
agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation
pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach
begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces
natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable
code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal
solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic
filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each
dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization
problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal
solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that
show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling
languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically
tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce
OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from
natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,
multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7
datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best
algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a
scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents
for real-world optimization applications.

Conclusion: AI模型可辅助环境教育，但人类专家的验证不可或缺。

Abstract: This research investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
models to bridge the knowledge gap in environmental education among university
students. By focusing on prominent large language models (LLMs) such as
GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude Sonnet, and Llama 2, the study assesses
their effectiveness in conveying environmental concepts and, consequently,
facilitating environmental education. The investigation employs a standardized
tool, the Environmental Knowledge Test (EKT-19), supplemented by targeted
questions, to evaluate the environmental knowledge of university students in
comparison to the responses generated by the AI models. The results of this
study suggest that while AI models possess a vast, readily accessible, and
valid knowledge base with the potential to empower both students and academic
staff, a human discipline specialist in environmental sciences may still be
necessary to validate the accuracy of the information provided.

algorithms that apply interventional, counterfactual, and transportability
queries to data from (randomized) controlled trials, observational studies, or
mixtures thereof. $Y_0$ focuses on the qualitative investigation of causation,
helping researchers determine whether a causal relationship can be estimated
from available data before attempting to estimate how strong that relationship
is. Furthermore, $Y_0$ provides guidance on how to transform the causal query
into a symbolic estimand that can be non-parametrically estimated from the
available data. $Y_0$ provides a domain-specific language for representing
causal queries and estimands as symbolic probabilistic expressions, tools for
representing causal graphical models with unobserved confounders, such as
acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs), and implementations of numerous
identification algorithms from the recent causal inference literature. The

Result: Geoint-R1在需要明确辅助元素构建的挑战性问题中表现显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Geoint-R1为形式几何推理提供了有效的解决方案，并通过Geoint基准推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and
educational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal
verification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal
geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying
auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce
Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally
verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.
Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning
represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically
evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint
benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across
diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem
includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary
constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing
multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging
problems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.

Abstract: Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However,
most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments
with little scientific planning or build on rule-based machine assistants,
encountering difficulties in knowledge expansion and inadequate flexibility.
This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting
learning partners tailored to inquiry-oriented learning, named InqEduAgent.
Generative agents are designed to capture cognitive and evaluative features of
learners in real-world scenarios. Then, an adaptive matching algorithm with
Gaussian process augmentation is formulated to identify patterns within prior
knowledge. Optimal learning-partner matches are provided for learners facing
different exercises. The experimental results show the optimal performance of
InqEduAgent in most knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environment with
different levels of capabilities. This study promotes the intelligent
allocation of human-based learning partners and the formulation of AI-based

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种全历史图模型和ETDNet网络，用于建模实体间动态交互，显著提升了驾驶意图预测和比特币欺诈检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实任务中需要建模实体间的动态交互（如交通预测、金融欺诈检测），现有方法通常使用快照图，但无法明确区分关系和时间的演化。

Method: 引入全历史图，区分时间步内和时间步间边；设计ETDNet网络，结合图注意力和时间注意力模块。

Result: 在Waymo和Elliptic++数据集上，ETDNet分别将联合准确率提升至75.6%和F1分数提升至88.1%。

Conclusion: 通过将结构和时间关系表示为图中的不同边，显著提升了动态交互建模的性能。

Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world
tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking
how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one
another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on
following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate
through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings
demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a
temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution
explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to
encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates
one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)
intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)
inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To
learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with
parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along
intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an
entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages
after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin
fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,
lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++
illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of
representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single
graph.

Motivation: 现有工具增强VQA在真实世界工具使用和多模态环境中的表现不佳，需要更贴近实际的数据集和方法。

Method: 提出ToolVQA数据集和ToolEngine数据生成流水线，采用DFS和动态上下文示例匹配机制模拟人类工具使用推理。

Result: 7B LFMs在ToolVQA上表现优异，并在OOD数据集上超越GPT-3.5-turbo，展示了强泛化能力。

Conclusion: ToolVQA和ToolEngine有效提升了模型在真实世界工具使用场景中的性能，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as
a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While
existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual
Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in
real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse
multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce
ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to
bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and
simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging
implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user
interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data
generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic
in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use
reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task
domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.
The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on
our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on
various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong
generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

TL;DR: Nemori是一种新型自组织记忆架构，解决了LLMs在长期交互中记忆持久性的问题，通过两步对齐原则和预测校准原则，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆系统依赖任意粒度的基本记忆单元和被动规则，限制了学习和进化能力，Nemori旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Nemori采用两步对齐原则（基于事件分割理论）和预测校准原则（基于自由能原理），自主组织语义连贯的记忆单元并主动学习。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准测试中，Nemori显著优于现有系统，尤其在长上下文场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: Nemori为自主代理的长期动态工作流提供了可行解决方案，展示了其在长上下文记忆管理中的优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their
inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their
effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing
memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for
defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge
extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address
these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing
memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core
innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for
autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically
coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,
its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables
the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined
heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path
toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.
Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that
Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its
advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

Motivation: 随着LLM（如ChatGPT和Claude）的兴起，需要能够实时处理任务的AI代理。传统云数据中心部署导致高延迟，而边缘部署面临资源有限和异构的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种自适应框架，利用蚁群算法和基于LLM的优化，建模资源约束和延迟/成本，实现高效决策和轻量级代理迁移。

Conclusion: 该方案为动态边缘环境中LLM-based AI代理的高效部署和管理提供了系统性解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents
capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly
reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

Motivation: LLMs使用CoT提示时生成冗余的思维过程，增加了推理成本并降低了效率。

Method: 引入步骤熵度量冗余，提出两阶段训练策略（SFT和GRPO），结合[SKIP]标记生成压缩CoT。

Result: 实验表明80%的低熵步骤可被剪枝，对准确性影响极小，显著提升效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM实际部署提供了高效解决方案，并深化了对推理结构的理解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at
complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable
redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We
introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric
that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to
identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical
validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with
low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an
astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor
degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and
Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,
which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a
novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach
enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference
by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances
LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering
profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding
of reasoning structures.

Conclusion: 研究为构建临床实用且语言鲁棒的语音认知评估工具提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a
promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current
approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages
and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we
propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual
and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for
speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal
pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning
English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,
CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade
substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their
performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore
lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which
significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a
critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust
speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

Result: 混合方法在可解释性和保留LLM优势方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 混合方法更适合通用逻辑推理，并提出了基于LLM-SS的通用框架。

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言描述在代码生成中存在模糊性，难以捕捉复杂需求和隐式数据依赖，因此需要一种更精确的方法。

Method: 1. 引入增强的UML序列图，整合决策表和API规范；2. 提出数据依赖推理（DDI）任务，构建显式数据依赖图；3. 使用数学推理和静态解析优化推理过程。

Result: 通过形式化规范和DDI任务，显著减少了模糊性，提升了代码生成的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: UML2Dep框架通过形式化规范和系统化推理，有效解决了复杂需求下的代码生成问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language
(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently
ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with
LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and
dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load
associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy
and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across
domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.
This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,
limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun
to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static
errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,
we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error
generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG
involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle,
deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect
them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic
precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that
HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher
accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of
deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

### [176] [Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis for Routing Problems Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03406)
*Kai Li,Ruihao Zheng,Xinye Hao,Zhenkun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOID结合LLM代理和多目标优化，为不可行路由问题提供多种可操作建议，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实路由问题中，用户需求常导致模型不可行，现有LLM方法无法全面调整模型。

Method: MOID结合多目标优化和LLM代理，生成权衡解并分析以提供诊断建议。

Result: 在50类不可行路由问题中，MOID单次运行即可生成多建议，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOID为不可行模型提供更实用的诊断和决策支持。

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or
unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due
to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty
feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods
attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves
multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this
gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which
combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic
routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.
Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path
cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each
encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical
insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution
analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these
distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users
with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with
several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The
results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic
suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring
model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的信息提取和知识图谱（KG）生成方法，用于连接生物医学知识。通过分解PubMed摘要并提取增强的三元组（四元组），验证了提取准确性，并探索了LLM推断新关系的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学数据快速增长与临床应用之间的鸿沟，帮助医学专业人员系统化理解最新知识。

Method: 使用LLM代理分解PubMed摘要为语义命题句子，提取并增强三元组（四元组），结合开放领域和基于本体的信息提取方法。

Result: 提取的三元组生成的自然语言句子与原命题的平均余弦相似度为0.874，增强三元组的相似度更高。LLM能推断新关系并连接知识图谱中的集群。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学从业者提供了集中、实时更新的知识源，并可能在其他领域实现类似效果。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

*Saleh Nikooroo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于有向加权图的信念系统形式化方法，区分信念的可信度和置信度，以更丰富地分类认知状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信念表示方法（如概率分布或逻辑框架）忽略了信念的内部结构，无法建模矛盾或碎片化的认知状态。

Method: 采用有向加权图表示信念系统，节点为信念，边为认知关系（支持或矛盾），并分别赋予可信度和置信度。

Result: 该方法无需假设先验一致性或信念更新，支持细粒度结构表示，优于概率、逻辑或论证框架。

Conclusion: 该形式化为信念系统的内部组织分析提供了基础，能更丰富地分类认知状态。

Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions
or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to
obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with
internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory
epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems
as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual
beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),
and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source
trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike
classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or
require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it
supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary
justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and
deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a
foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief
systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and
representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief
strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states
than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SmartGen是一个基于LLM的框架，用于合成上下文感知的用户行为数据，以支持智能家居模型的持续适应。它通过时间与语义分割、序列压缩、图引导的序列合成和异常过滤四个组件，显著提升了模型在行为漂移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能家居模型通常基于静态数据集训练，难以应对行为漂移（如季节变化或生活方式改变）。收集新数据成本高且涉及隐私问题，因此需要一种合成数据的方法。

Method: SmartGen包含四个关键组件：时间与语义分割、语义感知序列压缩、图引导的序列合成和两阶段异常过滤，利用LLM生成上下文一致的行为数据。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，SmartGen将异常检测性能平均提升85.43%，行为预测性能提升70.51%。

Conclusion: SmartGen通过合成高质量行为数据，有效解决了智能家居模型在行为漂移下的适应问题，显著提升了任务性能。

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely
used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models
are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral
drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.
However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due
to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose
SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior
data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen
consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware
Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically
coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose
Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving
representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,
we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior
relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the
LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core
behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify
and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve
the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen
significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior
prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by
85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at

real-life visual quizzes, and image-based questions that focus on improving
vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension. The system integrates Vision-Language
Pretraining models to generate contextually relevant image description from
which Large Language Model generate assignments based on customized Arabic
language Learning quizzes thanks to prompting.
  The effectiveness of the tool is evaluated through a manual annotated
benchmark consisting of 1266 real-life visual quizzes, with human participants
providing feedback. The results show a suitable accuracy rates, validating the
tool's potential to bridge the gap in Arabic language education and
highlighting the tool's promise as a reliable, AI-powered resource for Arabic
learners, offering personalized and interactive learning experiences.

*Yijin Yang,Cristina Cornelio,Mario Leiva,Paulo Shakarian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EDCIM方法通过检测和纠正大语言模型在数学任务中的错误，平衡成本与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理过程中常产生错误，且难以遵循特定输出格式，影响数学表达式或代码生成的准确性。

Method: EDCIM结合轻量级开源模型与强大专有模型，通过符号化错误检测框架识别并提供反馈，优化效率。

Result: 实验表明，EDCIM显著降低计算和财务成本，同时保持或提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: EDCIM为数学任务提供了一种高效且可配置的错误检测与纠正方法。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform
explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However,
their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to
inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with
hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is
particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or
source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for
Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors
in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact
functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural
language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a
system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection
framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based
correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source
LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This
balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the
trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results
across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both
computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,
prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大规模激活值在训练过程中的动态发展，填补了现有研究的空白，并为模型设计提供指导。

Method: 使用Pythia模型家族进行系统分析，提出基于指数调制对数函数的数学模型，并开发机器学习框架预测参数。

Result: 发现大规模激活值的发展遵循可预测的数学模式，机器学习框架能高精度预测稳态行为，中等精度预测出现时间和幅度。

Conclusion: 大规模激活值的出现受模型设计影响，可在训练前预测和控制，对模型稳定性、训练周期和优化有重要意义。

Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that
achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have
been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has
characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of
their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first
comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer
training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic
analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we
demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical
patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated
logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning
framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural
specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and
moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable
architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation
emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model
stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our
findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by
model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before
training begins.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型代码生成能力的提升，其对输入前提的依赖加深，错误前提易导致代码生成幻觉，暴露其自检能力的不足。

Method: 提出FPBench框架，系统构建三类错误前提，结合多维评估指标，对15种代表性大语言模型进行深入评估。

Result: 发现模型在错误前提下的推理能力和代码生成表现较差，资源投入存在边际效应，三类错误前提分别激活了不同的缺陷模式。

Conclusion: 研究强调了大语言模型在代码生成中主动验证前提的紧迫性，FPBench框架为开发可靠、以人为本的代码生成模型提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models
(LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide
inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation
hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their
self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench
(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty
premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises
and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth
assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)
Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation
performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for
error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises
trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to
blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of
faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,
revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation
models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively
verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench
framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical
foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code
generation models.

Result: 在MLGWSC-1数据集上性能提升20.2%，并发现新的算法组合。

Conclusion: Evo-MCTS不仅提升性能，还为计算科学领域的自动化算法发现提供了可转移的方法论。

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to
process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent
challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing
algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks
(DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from
fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its
reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box
architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose
Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses
these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by
domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search
with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create
interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates
substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art
gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset.
High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The
framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal
distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework
discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable
methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science
domains.

Conclusion: Agent Lightning为现实世界中的代理训练和部署提供了潜力强大的框架。

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment.

TL;DR: READ是一种基于扩散变换器的实时说话头生成框架，通过压缩视频和语音潜在空间及异步噪声调度器，显著提升了生成速度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在说话头生成中取得了显著进展，但其极慢的推理速度限制了实际应用。

Method: READ通过时间VAE压缩视频潜在空间，使用预训练的SpeechAE生成语音潜在代码，并通过A2V-DiT建模，同时采用异步噪声调度器（ANS）提升一致性和速度。

Result: 实验表明，READ在生成质量和速度上优于现有方法，并在长时间生成中保持稳定性。

Conclusion: READ在说话头生成中实现了质量与速度的平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.
