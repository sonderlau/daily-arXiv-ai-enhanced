Here, we leverage\ndeep learning (DL) to investigate the sources of MJO predictability, motivated\nby a central difference in MJO theories: which spatial scales are essential for\ndriving the MJO? We first develop a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to\nforecast the MJO indices (RMM and ROMI). Our model predicts RMM and ROMI up to\n21 and 33 days, respectively, achieving skills comparable to leading\nsubseasonal-to-seasonal models such as NCEP. To identify the spatial scales\nmost relevant for MJO forecasting, we conduct spectral analysis of the latent\nfeature space and find that large-scale patterns dominate the learned signals.\nAdditional experiments show that models using only large-scale signals as the\ninput have the same skills as those using all the scales, supporting the\nlarge-scale view of the MJO. Meanwhile, we find that small-scale signals remain\ninformative: surprisingly, models using only small-scale input can still\nproduce skillful forecasts up to 1-2 weeks ahead. We show that this is achieved\nby reconstructing the large-scale envelope of the small-scale activities, which\naligns with the multi-scale view of the MJO.

Since 2016,\nhowever, satellite gravimetry data reveal a slowdown in net AIS mass loss and a\nnet mass gain since 2020, despite increases in dynamically-driven ice loss by\ndischarge from outlet glaciers. Here we use a suite of reanalyses and regional\nclimate models to show that this reversal is caused by increased precipitation\nand positive surface mass balance anomalies linked to increased atmospheric\nriver (AR) activity, strengthening westerlies, and loss of sea ice. ARs have\nbecome more frequent and intense since 2020, particularly over the Antarctic\nPeninsula, Queen Maud Land, and Wilkes Land, resulting in strong regional\npositive mass balance anomalies.

This evolution is driven by the saturation of older benchmarks,\nwhere high performance often masks fundamental weaknesses. We chart the journey\nfrom the foundational \"knowledge tests\" of the ImageNet era to the \"applied\nlogic and comprehension\" exams such as GQA and Visual Commonsense Reasoning\n(VCR), which were designed specifically to diagnose systemic flaws such as\nshortcut learning and failures in compositional generalization. We then survey\nthe current frontier of \"expert-level integration\" benchmarks (e.g., MMBench,\nSEED-Bench, MMMU) designed for today's powerful multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs), which increasingly evaluate the reasoning process itself.\nFinally, we explore the uncharted territories of evaluating abstract, creative,\nand social intelligence. We conclude that the narrative of AI evaluation is not\nmerely a history of datasets, but a continuous, adversarial process of\ndesigning better examinations that, in turn, redefine our goals for creating\ntruly intelligent systems."}

To overcome this, we propose Decoupled Reward Policy\nOptimization (DRPO), a novel framework that decouples the length-based learning\nsignal of correct rollouts from incorrect ones.

Small shifts in user behavior, such as being more\nimpatient, incoherent, or skeptical, can cause sharp drops in agent\nperformance, revealing how brittle current AI agents are. Today's benchmarks\nfail to capture this fragility: agents may perform well under standard\nevaluations but degrade spectacularly in more realistic and varied settings. We\naddress this robustness testing gap by introducing TraitBasis, a lightweight,\nmodel-agnostic method for systematically stress testing AI agents. TraitBasis\nlearns directions in activation space corresponding to steerable user traits\n(e.g., impatience or incoherence), which can be controlled, scaled, composed,\nand applied at inference time without any fine-tuning or extra data. Using\nTraitBasis, we extend $\\tau$-Bench to $\\tau$-Trait, where user behaviors are\naltered via controlled trait vectors. We observe on average a 2%-30%\nperformance degradation on $\\tau$-Trait across frontier models, highlighting\nthe lack of robustness of current AI agents to variations in user behavior.\nTogether, these results highlight both the critical role of robustness testing\nand the promise of TraitBasis as a simple, data-efficient, and compositional\ntool. By powering simulation-driven stress tests and training loops, TraitBasis\nopens the door to building AI agents that remain reliable in the unpredictable\ndynamics of real-world human interactions.

Here we introduce an\nalternative approach: We use the LLM to translate natural language rules and\ngame trajectories into a formal, executable world model represented as Python\ncode. This generated model -- comprising functions for state transition, legal\nmove enumeration, and termination checks -- serves as a verifiable simulation\nengine for high-performance planning algorithms like Monte Carlo tree search\n(MCTS). In addition, we prompt the LLM to generate heuristic value functions\n(to make MCTS more efficient), and inference functions (to estimate hidden\nstates in imperfect information games).

As AI\nsystems increasingly mimic human behavior and interaction with high fidelity,\nthe concept of a \"perfect mimic\"-an entity empirically indistinguishable from a\nhuman through observation and interaction-shifts from hypothetical to\ntechnologically plausible. This paper argues that such developments pose a\nfundamental challenge to the consistency of our mind-recognition practices.\nConsciousness attributions rely heavily, if not exclusively, on empirical\nevidence derived from behavior and interaction. If a perfect mimic provides\nevidence identical to that of humans, any refusal to grant it equivalent\nepistemic status must invoke inaccessible factors, such as qualia, substrate\nrequirements, or origin. Selectively invoking such factors risks a debilitating\ndilemma: either we undermine the rational basis for attributing consciousness\nto others (epistemological solipsism), or we accept inconsistent reasoning.

However, some self-interested users may exploit the\nlimitations of content curation mechanisms and generate low-quality content\nwith less effort, obtaining platform rewards under information asymmetry. Such\nbehavior can undermine Web 3.0 performance. To this end, we propose\n\\textit{LMM-Incentive}, a novel Large Multimodal Model (LMM)-based incentive\nmechanism for UGC in Web 3.0. Specifically, we propose an LMM-based\ncontract-theoretic model to motivate users to generate high-quality UGC,\nthereby mitigating the adverse selection problem from information asymmetry. To\nalleviate potential moral hazards after contract selection, we leverage LMM\nagents to evaluate UGC quality, which is the primary component of the contract,\nutilizing prompt engineering techniques to improve the evaluation performance\nof LMM agents. Recognizing that traditional contract design methods cannot\neffectively adapt to the dynamic environment of Web 3.0, we develop an improved\nMixture of Experts (MoE)-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for\noptimal contract design. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed MoE-based PPO algorithm over representative benchmarks in the context\nof contract design. Finally, we deploy the designed contract within an Ethereum\nsmart contract framework, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed\nscheme."}

An emerging trend posits using the outputs of pre-trained\nmodels as 'embeddings' which summarize high dimensional data to be used for\ngeneric tasks such as similarity search and content-specific queries. However,\nmost EOFM models are trained only on single modalities of data and then applied\nor benchmarked by matching bands across different modalities. It is not clear\nfrom existing work what impact diverse sensor architectures have on the\ninternal representations of the present suite of EOFMs. We show in this work\nthat the representation space of EOFMs is highly sensitive to sensor\narchitecture and that understanding this difference gives a vital perspective\non the pitfalls of current EOFM design and signals for how to move forward as\nmodel developers, users, and a community guided by robust remote-sensing\nscience."}

This conventional approach\ntreats tokens as a flat vocabulary, disregarding the intrinsic structure of the\ntoken embedding space where proximity often correlates with semantic\nsimilarity. This oversight results in a highly complex prediction task, which\nhinders training efficiency and limits final generation quality. To resolve\nthis, we propose Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering (MASC), a principled\nframework that constructs a hierarchical semantic tree directly from the\ncodebook's intrinsic structure. MASC employs a novel geometry-aware distance\nmetric and a density-driven agglomerative construction to model the underlying\nmanifold of the token embeddings. By transforming the flat, high-dimensional\nprediction task into a structured, hierarchical one, MASC introduces a\nbeneficial inductive bias that significantly simplifies the learning problem\nfor the AR model. MASC is designed as a plug-and-play module, and our extensive\nexperiments validate its effectiveness: it accelerates training by up to 57%\nand significantly improves generation quality, reducing the FID of LlamaGen-XL\nfrom 2.87 to 2.58. MASC elevates existing AR frameworks to be highly\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art methods, establishing that structuring the\nprediction space is as crucial as architectural innovation for scalable\ngenerative modeling."}

Therefore, we introduce the first\nbiometric leakage defense without ever looking at the reconstructed RGB video:\na pose-conditioned, large-margin contrastive encoder that isolates persistent\nidentity cues inside the transmitted latent while cancelling transient pose and\nexpression. A simple cosine test on this disentangled embedding flags illicit\nidentity swaps as the video is rendered. Our experiments on multiple\ntalking-head generation models show that our method consistently outperforms\nexisting puppeteering defenses, operates in real-time, and shows strong\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution scenarios."}

Here we introduce EgoSurg, the first framework to reconstruct the\ndynamic, egocentric replays for any operating room (OR) staff directly from\nwall-mounted fixed-camera video, and thus, without intervention to clinical\nworkflow. EgoSurg couples geometry-driven neural rendering with diffusion-based\nview enhancement, enabling high-visual fidelity synthesis of arbitrary and\negocentric viewpoints at any moment. In evaluation across multi-site surgical\ncases and controlled studies, EgoSurg reconstructs person-specific visual\nfields and arbitrary viewpoints with high visual quality and fidelity. By\ntransforming existing OR camera infrastructure into a navigable dynamic 3D\nrecord, EgoSurg establishes a new foundation for immersive surgical data\nscience, enabling surgical practice to be visualized, experienced, and analyzed\nfrom every angle."}

We offer an under-studied perspective by\nexamining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and\nLlama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the\nflow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value\ntokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks\nzero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and\nreferring expression detection. We find that while the language model does\naugment the visual information received from the projection of input visual\nencodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it\ncontains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual\nencoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that\nthe visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in\nlater layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception\ncapability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information\nin the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input\nimproves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal\nthat if language models were able to better control their visual information,\ntheir perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style\nquestions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the\nlanguage model is not surfaced to the output!

The high computation\ncost of data collection and training motivates the owners of some VFMs to\ndistribute them alongside the license to protect their intellectual property\nrights. However, a dishonest user of the protected model's copy may illegally\nredistribute it, for example, to make a profit. As a consequence, the\ndevelopment of reliable ownership verification tools is of great importance\ntoday, since such methods can be used to differentiate between a redistributed\ncopy of the protected model and an independent model. In this paper, we propose\nan approach to ownership verification of visual foundation models by\nfine-tuning a small set of expressive layers of a VFM along with a small\nencoder-decoder network to embed digital watermarks into an internal\nrepresentation of a hold-out set of input images.
