Conventional explainable AI approaches\noffer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic\ncollaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a\nphilosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks\nthat treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions\nAI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human\nconfidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and\nconfidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as\na formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is\nempirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's\nadaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive\nintervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It\nalso integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI\nbehavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring\ncommunication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,\ntogether with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human\nintelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in\ncollaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the\nprotocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of\nAI decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSymbiotic Epistemology\u7684\u54f2\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06AI\u89c6\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u4f19\u4f34\u800c\u975e\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7SynLang\u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0\u900f\u660e\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5171\u751f\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Symbiotic Epistemology\u54f2\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u548cSynLang\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ecTRACE\u548cTRACE_FE\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u900f\u660e\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u5fc3\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cAI\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u534f\u8bae\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5e72\u9884\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "conclusion": "SynLang\u548c\u5171\u751f\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u900f\u660e\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u5e76\u7ef4\u62a4\u4f26\u7406\u8d23\u4efb\u3002"}}

Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the\npotential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model\ndiversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We\ndemonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating\na disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,\nevaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module.

CARPTDSC has two main challenges about time\nconsumption. First, it is an NP-hard problem. Second, the time-dependent\nservice costs of tasks require frequent evaluations during the search process,\nsignificantly increasing computational effort. These challenges make it\ndifficult for existing algorithms to perform efficient searches, often\nresulting in limited efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nknowledge-guided memetic algorithm with golden section search and negatively\ncorrelated search (KGMA-GN), where two knowledge-guided strategies are\nintroduced to improve search efficiency. First, a knowledge-guided\ninitialization strategy (KGIS) is proposed to generate high-quality initial\nsolutions to speed up convergence. Second, a knowledge-guided small-step-size\nlocal search strategy (KGSLSS) is proposed to filter out invalid moves, thereby\nreducing unnecessary evaluations and saving the computation time. Experimental\nresults on five benchmark test sets, including both small- and larger-scale\ninstances, demonstrate that KGMA-GN achieves higher search efficiency than the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

The first method is based on converting a\nSudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first\nproposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures\nthe structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given\ndigits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku\nsolvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking\nalgorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number\nof times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a\nrandomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand\nSudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty\nlevel in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics\nand website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a\nuniversal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the\ntwo proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both\nindividual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku\nwebsites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and\nUniversal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku\nwebsites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,\nthe universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty\nlevels.

For\nthe cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the\nLLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask\nout the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the\npotential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local\nConnectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive\nglobal and local structural characteristics of tubular networks.

In addition, we design a lightweight\nDual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation\nquality by refining the resulting segmentation maps.

This hinders detectors\nfrom comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To\nalleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative\nPerceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to\nmine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object\ndetection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial\nrepresentations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a\npipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density\ninformation (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information.

In\ngeneral, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency\ntraining via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive\nsemantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of\nextracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled\ndata. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \\underline{Du}al\n\\underline{C}ross-\\underline{i}mage \\underline{S}emantic\n\\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised\nmedical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic\nconsistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic\nconsistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused\nimages, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,\nDuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype\nrepresentations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we\ndevise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select\nreliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of\nunlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,\nincluding two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and\npancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a\nchallenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features\ncomplicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over\nprevious state-of-the-art approaches.

However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene\nrepresentation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their\ncomprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to\nbehaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose\na navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual\nperceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic\ngrounding.

This procedure, named as Self-Supervised\nDataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,\nyielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.\nParticularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset\nmore faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we\nintroduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via\ndistinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization\nis experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability\ninduced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in\nself-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of\nself-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined\naugmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the\nconnections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,\nleading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted\non various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of\ndistillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer\nlearning performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u7ef4\u57fa\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u548c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u7ef4\u57fa\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u8868\u793a\uff1b2) \u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff1b3) \u8f7b\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using\nprompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a\nsingle-stream mode.

Existing methods\ntypically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view\nimages) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still\nstruggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training\ndata. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP\ninherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream\ntasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named\nDescribe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set\n3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large\nlanguage model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM\nis used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to\nalign with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it\nprovides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues\nduring inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias\nLow-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further\nenhances the generalization to unseen categories.

Chess, a\nlong-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal\ntestbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human\nbehavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,\nmaking them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we\nintroduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual\ndecision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves\nthis through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which\nbridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a\nprototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages\nability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual\nembeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can\naccurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high\nfidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior\nmodeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in\nchess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,\nrepresenting a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an\nexample of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users\nusing a prototype-enriched model as a bridge.

A promising\nstrategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images\ncontaining broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake\ndetection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online\nsynthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the\ncommon belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance\ndetection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to\ngradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between\nsource domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this\nissue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework\nthat explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.\nFirst, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update\nvector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the\noriginal and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search\nprocess into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update\nvector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.\nSecond, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict\nfeature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss\npenalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of\nrepresentations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and\nCGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and\nrepresentation learning.

The Sun and fixed stars are the\ntwo primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical\ncomponents for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,\nsun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude\ndetermination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft\ncoordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due\nto the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are\nsmall, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of\nthe sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of\nuncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and\ninterference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration\nalgorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve\naccuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have\nbeen explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is\ncurrently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of\nwork.

Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges\nfor efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network\npruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational\nrequirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant\nparameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally\nremoving redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning\ntechniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,\nresulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,\na novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top\nof any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant\nfilters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted\nQR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent\nfilters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's\nkernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any\nfine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet\nbackbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing\npruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the\nart in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no\nretraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and\ninference speedups over a state-of-the-art method.

Direct preference\noptimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by\naligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies\ntypically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on\nstatic supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to\nsuperficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional\nrigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant\nvisual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a\ntoken-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max\noptimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under\nsemantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously\nminimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.\nThis joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to\npreference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.\nWe evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently\nstrong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,\nTARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition\nvalue from 2.5 to 0.4.

The resulting network is evaluated both\nusing synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising\nperformance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose\nmAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u68c0\u6d4b\u98ce\u529b\u6da1\u8f6e\u673a\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff08\u5982\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u5149\u7167\u3001\u6da1\u8f6e\u7c7b\u578b\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63a7\u5236\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6539\u8fdb\u7684YOLOv11\u7f51\u7edc\u68c0\u6d4b\u98ce\u529b\u6da1\u8f6e\u673a\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u672a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0aPose mAP50-95\u8fbe\u52300.97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u98ce\u529b\u6da1\u8f6e\u673a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

While\ntraining-based approaches address this limitation by training on\nhigh-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable\ncomputational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,\ntraining-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a\npopular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the\ndenoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution\ngeneration. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,\nwhich we call ``patch-level distribution shift\" and ``increased patch\nmonotonicity.\" To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),\na framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions\nremain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with\nthe patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined\ndetails in high-resolution images.

Alternatively,\nmethods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent\nspace frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to\ntreat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules\nwithin a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that\nprovides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to\nrefine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we\nintroduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend\npatterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,\nrather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the\nlatent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly\nmodels inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.\nExperiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG\nconsistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value\nof explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDualSG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\u800c\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u6216\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "DualSG\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08Time Series Caption\uff09\u663e\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6807\u9898\u5f15\u5bfc\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDualSG\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e15\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We\npresent the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)\nframework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption\nsupervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based\nrewards. Adapting the \"1-shot RLVR\" paradigm from language models to\nvision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as\none curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.\nComprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including\nclassification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a\nsingle example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to\n128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated\nsamples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific\noverfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and\nefficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss\nweighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy.

Existing RGB-D VSOD models\nhave different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion\ninformation explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and\npromising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to\neffectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.\nPrevious methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to\nmodel designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in\nindividual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address\nthis issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel\nselective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a\npixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of\noptical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose\na multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused\nfeatures derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple\ndimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined\nfeatures.

Among these applications, fundus image analysis\npresents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus\ndiseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced\nprediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the\nShifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)\nAttention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin\nTransformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and\nlong-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is\nincorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature\nchannels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to\nprevious studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,\nthis work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby\nenhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye\nDisease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category\nclassification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\\%\naccuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90.

Historical research in this area\nhas focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent\ndeep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most\nECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to\nclassify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method\nwas the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science\nChallenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual\nnoise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform\npatterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a\ntwo-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and\nexternal ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further\nfine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We\nadopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method\nachieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the\nprivate test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,\nhighlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation\nin clinical workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\uff08ECG\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u4e94\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u8bca\u65ad\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6ce2\u5f62\u7ec6\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\uff08CVDs\uff09\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u8981\u6b7b\u56e0\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002ECG\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5148\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8eConvNeXt\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f97AUROC\u5206\u65700.9688\u548c0.9677\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316ECG\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained\nsegmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain\ndiscriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial\ndomain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets\ndemonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of\n0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which\nscored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in\nF1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with\ncitizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same\narchitecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of\n0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully\nsupervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations.

However, these\nmodels trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about\nthe consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual\nunderstanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban\nnavigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and\nmoving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the\nSeeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation\nfoundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of\npre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the\ngeneralizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing\nits interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we\nintroduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,\nwhich stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through\nanchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains\nreactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's\npretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end\nevaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions\nof real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can\nsystematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation\nmodels.

This combination\nprioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step\ncompositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets\n(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms\nexisting active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step\nrecognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for\nefficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing\ncomputer-assisted surgical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "StepAL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6b65\u9aa4\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u71b5\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u7c7b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b8c\u6574\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "StepAL\u7ed3\u5408\u6b65\u9aa4\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5229\u7528\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u548c\u71b5\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u7c7b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u4e14\u6b65\u9aa4\u591a\u6837\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u5728Cataract-1k\u548cCataract-101\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cStepAL\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u9891\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "StepAL\u4e3a\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a\nlarge-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on\nMOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different\nrelated tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current\nmethods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the\nassociated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion\nAppearance Network (DMA).
