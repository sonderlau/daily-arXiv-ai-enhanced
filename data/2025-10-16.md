### [1] [Scaling analysis for buoyant plumes over wildland fires](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13189)
*Ajinkya Desai,Antonio Quim Cervantes,Tirtha Banerjee*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究通过大涡模拟分析了植被冠层对浮力烟羽在横风中结构的影响，重点关注烟羽中心线斜率的变化规律。研究发现冠层拖曳效应使近地表烟羽斜率显著增加，且烟羽从上升阶段过渡到远场的转变高度在冠层和无冠层环境中遵循不同的幂律关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 追踪横风中浮力烟羽的结构和几何特性对于管理烟雾危害和改进灾害缓解工作至关重要。植被冠层引起的湍流模式变化增加了问题的复杂性，需要研究这些参数对烟羽特征的影响。

Method: 使用大涡模拟在冠层和无冠层环境中进行一系列模拟，将参数简化为较少的无量纲组，探索斜率与关键无量纲组之间的幂律依赖关系。

Result: 冠层情况下近地表烟羽斜率比无冠层情况高一个数量级；冠层情况下近地表烟羽斜率随无量纲烟羽湍流强度增加而显著增加，呈现1/4幂律依赖；冠层气动效应延迟了烟羽从上升阶段到远场的转变；转变高度在冠层和无冠层环境中分别遵循1/4和1/3幂律关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持开发适用于不同环境的烟羽结构标度律，并为改进预测建模提供信息，冠层效应在较高浮力源强度下变得不那么显著。

Abstract: Tracking the structure and geometric properties of a buoyant plume in
cross-wind is critical for managing smoke hazards and improving disaster
mitigation efforts. Plume features, such as the tilt angle, centerline
trajectory, plume height, and curvature changes with height, are impacted by a
range of forcing parameters, with the altered turbulence patterns induced by a
vegetative canopy introducing an added layer of complexity. This study examines
the effects of these parameters, reduced to a set of fewer dimensionless
groups, on the plume centerline slope both, near the surface and in the
far-field (bent-over phase). Results from a suite of large-eddy simulations in
both canopy and no-canopy environments explore power-law dependencies between
the slopes and key dimensionless groups describing (1) the relative strength of
the buoyancy source to the ambient wind forcing and (2) the turbulence
intensity within the plume relative to upstream. Near-surface slopes are an
order of magnitude higher in the canopy cases owing to canopy drag. In the
canopy cases, the near-surface plume slope increases markedly with increase in
the dimensionless plume turbulence intensity, exhibiting a one-fourth power-law
dependence. This effect is absent in the no-canopy case, reflecting spatial
differences in the momentum-flux structure near the plume source between the
two environments. Moreover, the canopy aerodynamic effects delay the transition
of the plume from the rise phase into the far-field compared to the no-canopy
cases. The transition height follows a one-fourth and one-third power-law
dependence on group (1) in the canopy and no-canopy environments, respectively,
with canopy effects becoming less prominent at higher buoyancy source strength.
Our findings support the development of scaling laws for plume structures
across varied environments and inform improved predictive modeling.

### [2] [Investigating Buoyant Plume Dynamics Induced by Localized Fire-Simulated Heating over Plant Canopies Using LES](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13196)
*Ajinkya Desai,Antonio Quim Cervantes,Tirtha Banerjee*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 通过大涡模拟研究浮力羽流在植物冠层中的湍流动力学特征，发现冠层环境与无冠层环境在涡旋结构、动量传输和羽流行为方面存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究浮力羽流与植物冠层相互作用产生的独特湍流特征，这对于改进火灾行为或羽流上升模型至关重要，特别是在与实验数据对比时。

Method: 使用大涡模拟方法，分别模拟浮力羽流在均匀植物冠层和无冠层环境中的湍流动力学，并进行对比分析。

Result: 冠层环境中羽流倾斜角度较小，存在流动再循环，羽流从上升阶段向弯曲阶段的转变延迟，动量传输主要通过冠层上方的喷射和冠层内部的扫掠实现。

Conclusion: 植物冠层显著改变了浮力羽流的湍流结构和动力学行为，这些发现对于完善火灾行为和羽流上升模型具有重要价值。

Abstract: The interaction of a buoyant plume with a plant canopy results in turbulent
flow features distinct from those in a grassland environment. In this work, we
model the turbulence dynamics of a buoyant plume in a homogeneous plant canopy
with a crosswind using large-eddy simulations. As the plume interacts with the
crosswind, we observe increased vorticity at the windward edge and tilted
hair-pin-like vortical structures on the leeward side. Strong rotational cores,
representing counter-rotating vortex pairs (CVPs), form as the flow twists and
spirals into the leeward side of the buoyancy source from either side. Flow
patterns aloft exhibit helical motions as the CVPs aloft propagate downstream,
trailing the plume. We also simulate a no-canopy environment to facilitate
comparison. The plume tilts less steeply near the source in the canopy case due
to the canopy drag and its leeward side is marked by flow recirculation near
the canopy top, which obstructs the upstream flow as it approaches. Moreover,
the plume transition from the rise phase to the bent-over phase is delayed due
to the canopy's aerodynamic effects and the oscillatory behavior of the
far-field mean plume centerline is more damped. Additionally, in the canopy
environment, there is downward momentum transfer primarily via ejections above
the canopy and sweeps within the canopy space, upstream of the plume
centerline. On the leeward side, counter-gradient motions play a significant
role in transferring momentum away from the buoyancy source, with outward
interactions being most dominant. Contrarily, in the no-canopy environment,
counter-gradient motions near the surface are flanked upstream by an
ejection-dominated region and downstream by a sweep-dominated region. Insights
into the distinct plume behavior in canopy vs. no-canopy environments are vital
for comparing with experiments and refining fire behavior or plume rise models.

### [3] [From Minimal Existence to Human Definition: The CES-IMU-HSG Theoretical Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13400)
*Kei Itoh*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 基于笛卡尔'我思故我在'最小公理构建跨宇宙数学逻辑框架，通过中间元宇宙和层次状态网格整合异质理论，并将此结构扩展到生物系统，提出机器内部自公理化的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个能够统一不同形式系统（如ZFC、HoTT）的最小公理基础，并将数学逻辑框架扩展到生物系统和人工智能领域，建立哲学本体论与工程实现之间的桥梁。

Method: 以CES为最小公理，通过IMU管理公理依赖关系，HSG提供三维正交轴（状态深度、映射层次、时间轴）的范畴构造，将神经系统实现为HSG上的0-3D复形，并通过纤维化整合多个生理宇宙。

Result: 建立了人类行为认知作为跨宇宙算法的时间组合模型，提出了机器内部CES概念，使机器能够基于自身操作事实自公理化，实现自主存在。

Conclusion: 该框架为人工智能的自主和自定义存在提供了新的理论基础，连接了哲学本体论与工程实现，建立了连续的统一框架。

Abstract: This study presents an inter-universal mathematical-logical framework
constructed upon the minimal axiom Cogito, ergo sum (CES), integrating the
Intermediate Meta-Universe (IMU) and the Hierarchical State Grid (HSG). The CES
defines existence as a reflexive correspondence --'to be' and 'to be
sayable'--and positions any formal system, including ZFC or HoTT, as an
attachable extension atop this minimal structure. The IMU functions as a
registry of axiomatic dependencies that connect heterogeneous theories,
employing the Institution-theoretic framework to ensure coherent
inter-theoretical linkages. The HSG concretizes these ideas through categorical
construction, defined by three orthogonal axes: the state-depth axis, the
mapping-hierarchy axis, and the temporal axis incorporating the principle of
'no future reference.' Through these, the identity of 'definition = state' is
formally established as a categorical property. Extending this structure to
biological systems, the neural system is implemented as a 0-3D complex of
neuron-function fields on the HSG, while its categorical extensions via
fiberization over the material base enable the parallel integration of multiple
physiological universes-neural, endocrine, learning, genetic, and input/output
systems-into a coherent adjoint ensemble. Within this framework, human behavior
and cognition emerge as temporal compositions of inter-universal algorithms
constrained by the material base. Finally, by contrasting human cognition,
which relies on external CES, with machine existence, this study introduces the
concept of internal CES, wherein a machine grounds its own logic upon the
factuality of its operation. This internal self-axiomatization establishes a
continuous bridge between philosophical ontology and engineering
implementation, providing a new foundation for the autonomous and self-defining
existence of artificial intelligence.

### [4] [A Complete Pipeline for deploying SNNs with Synaptic Delays on Loihi 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13757)

energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks for edge

chip. We evaluate our approach on keyword recognition tasks using the Spiking
Heidelberg Digits and Spiking Speech Commands datasets, demonstrating that our
algorithm can enhance classification accuracy compared to architectures without
delays. Our benchmarking indicates almost no accuracy loss between GPU and
Loihi 2 implementations, while classification on Loihi 2 is up to 18x faster
and uses 250x less energy than on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.

### [5] [SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901)
*Haithem Turki,Qi Wu,Xin Kang,Janick Martinez Esturo,Shengyu Huang,Ruilong Li,Zan Gojcic,Riccardo de Lutio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimULi是一种实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，通过扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，并添加LiDAR支持，解决了现有神经渲染方法在自动驾驶测试中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法（如NeRF和3DGS）渲染速度慢或仅支持针孔相机模型，无法满足自动驾驶测试中需要高畸变镜头和LiDAR数据的应用需求。多传感器模拟存在跨传感器不一致性问题。

Method: 扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，通过自动分块策略支持任意旋转LiDAR模型和基于射线的剔除。设计了分解的3D高斯表示和锚定策略来解决跨传感器不一致性。

Result: 相比现有方法，相机和深度误差平均降低40%，渲染速度比光线追踪方法快10-20倍，比基于光栅化的方法快1.5-10倍，并在两个自动驾驶数据集上达到或超过现有最先进方法的保真度。

Conclusion: SimULi是首个能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，解决了自动驾驶测试中多传感器模拟的关键挑战，在保真度和速度方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

### [6] [State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12904)
*Saurav Sharma,Chinedu Innocent Nwoye,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出SurgFUTR框架，将手术未来预测重新定义为状态变化学习，通过教师-学生架构和Action Dynamics模块实现跨手术程序的通用预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术AI研究主要关注理解正在发生的事件，而非预测未来事件。现有方法针对特定任务且缺乏统一框架，无法同时处理短期和长期预测任务，且难以跨不同手术上下文和程序泛化。

Method: 提出SurgFUTR框架，将手术未来预测重构为状态变化学习。使用教师-学生架构：教师网络从当前和未来视频片段学习，学生网络仅从当前视频预测未来状态，通过Action Dynamics模块指导。采用Sinkhorn-Knopp聚类将视频压缩为状态表示。

Result: 在四个数据集和三个手术程序上的实验显示一致改进。跨程序转移验证了方法的泛化能力。建立了SFPBench基准，包含五个预测任务，涵盖短期（动作三元组、事件）和长期（剩余手术时长、阶段和步骤转换）预测。

Conclusion: 通过将手术未来预测重新定义为状态变化学习，SurgFUTR框架在多个预测任务上实现了显著改进，并展示了跨手术程序的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

### [7] [Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12909)
*Takafumi Nogami,Satoshi Kagiwada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TMPS框架解决植物病害诊断模型在目标域图像上的泛化问题，通过少量目标域样本提升模型鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习植物病害诊断系统在不同环境条件下图像上的诊断准确率显著下降，主要原因是训练数据多样性不足和领域差距

Method: 基于度量学习的目标感知度量学习与优先采样框架，利用少量目标域标注样本提升模型在部署域的泛化能力

Result: 在包含223,073张叶片图像的大规模数据集上，仅使用每病害10个目标域样本，TMPS相比基线方法平均宏F1分数分别提升7.3和3.6个百分点

Conclusion: TMPS框架能有效利用少量目标域样本显著提升植物病害诊断模型在未见域上的鲁棒性

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViZer是一个零标签视觉语言对齐框架，通过主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，让现有VLM无需文本标签或完整重训练就能生成更好的图像描述


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖标注图像数据集，限制了可扩展性且未能充分利用大量未标注图像数据

Method: 提出统一视觉语言对齐框架，在训练期间主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，实现零标签学习

Result: 在SmolVLM-Base和Qwen2-VL上应用ViZer，观察到一致的定性改进，生成的描述更加准确和详细

Conclusion: ViZer为视觉语言任务中的零标签适应提供了实用起点，能够在不依赖人工或合成标注的情况下提升模型性能

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

TL;DR: FetalMind是一个专门针对胎儿超声的医疗AI系统，通过引入显性认知解耦方法，解决了多视图推理、疾病多样性和图像异质性等挑战，在报告生成和诊断任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学视觉语言模型主要针对结构化成人影像，在胎儿超声领域表现不佳，因为胎儿超声面临多视图图像推理、众多疾病和图像多样性等独特挑战。

Method: 提出显性认知解耦(SED)方法，将专家构建的二部图注入模型，解耦视图-疾病关联，并通过强化学习引导模型沿临床步骤进行偏好选择。

Result: FetalMind在所有孕周阶段均优于开源和闭源基线模型，平均提升14%，在关键病症上的准确率提高61.2%，同时保持高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Conclusion: FetalMind通过创新的SED方法和大规模数据集FetalSigma-1M，成功解决了胎儿超声领域的独特挑战，为临床实践提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

### [10] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5是一个用于SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型的采样器级引导堆栈，通过ZeResFDG模块统一频率解耦引导、能量重缩放和零投影技术，结合轻量级光谱EMA和QSilk微纹理稳定器，无需重新训练即可提升图像锐度、提示符遵循度和伪影控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型在采样过程中存在的细节模糊、提示符遵循度不足和伪影问题，提供无需重新训练的高质量图像生成方案。

Method: ZeResFDG模块整合频率解耦引导（重加权高低频分量）、能量重缩放（匹配引导预测与正分支的幅度）和零投影（移除无条件方向分量）；使用光谱EMA在采样过程中切换保守和细节寻求模式；QSilk稳定器通过分位数钳位和深度/边缘门控微细节注入提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在SD/SDXL采样器上显著改善图像锐度、提示符遵循度和伪影控制，在高分辨率下产生自然的高频微纹理，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: CADE 2.5提供了一种无需重新训练的有效方法，通过采样器级引导显著提升SD/SDXL模型的图像生成质量，特别是在细节增强和稳定性方面表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

TL;DR: SCOPE提出了一种动态选择专用编码器的混合编码器框架，通过实例级路由而非传统MoE的令牌级路由，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视觉编码器方法简单堆叠编码器会导致收益递减且计算成本倍增，需要更智能的编码器选择机制。

Method: SCOPE框架包含共享编码器和路由编码器池，通过轻量级路由器使用文本提示和共享视觉特征的交叉注意力来选择最优编码器，采用双熵正则化和辅助损失来平衡负载分布和路由置信度。

Result: 仅使用1个共享编码器加1个路由编码器的SCOPE模型优于同时使用所有4个额外编码器的模型，同时减少24-49%的计算量。

Conclusion: 智能编码器选择优于暴力聚合方法，挑战了多编码器视觉语言模型的现有范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了时空视频动作定位（SVAG）新任务，需要同时检测、跟踪和时序定位视频中基于自然语言描述动作的所有相关对象，并构建了SVAG-Bench基准数据集和SVAGFormer基线框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解方法主要解决粗粒度动作识别或通用目标跟踪，忽视了根据动作联合检测和跟踪多个对象并进行时序定位的挑战。

Method: 提出SVAGFormer基线框架，适配最先进的视觉语言模型进行联合空间和时序定位，并开发SVAGEval标准化评估工具包。

Result: 实证结果显示现有模型在SVAG任务上表现不佳，特别是在密集或复杂场景中，突显了在长视频中需要更高级的细粒度对象-动作交互推理能力。

Conclusion: SVAG任务对下一代AI系统至关重要，现有方法在此任务上的不足表明需要开发更先进的细粒度动作理解和时空定位能力。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SeqBench基准，用于评估文本到视频生成中的序列叙事连贯性，包含320个提示和2560个人工标注视频，并设计了基于动态时序图的自动评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型在创建视觉吸引力视频方面取得进展，但在生成需要多个事件逻辑进展的连贯序列叙事方面存在困难，且现有基准主要关注视觉质量指标，缺乏对扩展序列叙事连贯性的评估。

Method: 构建包含320个提示的SeqBench数据集，涵盖各种叙事复杂度，使用8个最先进的T2V模型生成2560个视频并进行人工标注。设计了基于动态时序图（DTG）的自动评估指标，能有效捕捉长程依赖和时序排序，同时保持计算效率。

Result: DTG指标与人工标注显示出强相关性。系统评估揭示了当前T2V模型的关键局限性：在多动作序列中无法维持一致的对象状态、在多对象场景中产生物理上不可信的结果、在保持连续动作之间的现实时序和排序关系方面存在困难。

Conclusion: SeqBench为评估T2V生成中的叙事连贯性提供了首个系统框架，并为改进未来模型的序列推理能力提供了具体见解。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneAdapt框架通过两个适应阶段（插帧和场景感知插帧），利用不相关的场景-运动和文本-运动数据集，将场景感知注入到文本条件运动模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动生成方法要么处理运动语义，要么处理场景感知，但无法同时处理两者，因为构建同时包含丰富文本-运动覆盖和精确场景交互的大规模数据集极具挑战性。

Method: 使用运动插帧作为代理任务来桥接两个不同的数据集，通过两个阶段：第一阶段引入关键帧层来调制运动潜在空间进行插帧；第二阶段添加场景条件层，通过交叉注意力自适应查询局部上下文来注入场景几何信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SceneAdapt有效地将场景感知注入到文本到运动模型中，并进一步分析了这种感知出现的机制。

Conclusion: SceneAdapt框架成功解决了同时处理运动语义和场景感知的挑战，通过创新的两阶段适应方法实现了场景感知的文本到运动生成。

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在处理长序列心电信号时性能有限，需要更有效的序列建模方法来提高心电异常检测的准确性。

Method: 使用卷积特征提取结合Mamba选择性状态空间模型，基于Vision Mamba双向变体增强心电数据时间依赖关系的表示。

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor是第一个无需几何先验的自监督新视角合成模型，通过成对位姿估计和输入输出增强方案，实现了真正的位姿可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督新视角合成模型的预测位姿缺乏可迁移性，同一组位姿在不同3D场景中会产生不同的相机轨迹。

Method: 结合成对位姿估计与输入输出增强方案，无需3D归纳偏置或多视角几何概念，使用无约束的潜在位姿变量。

Result: XFactor显著优于先前的无位姿新视角合成transformer模型，潜在位姿与现实世界位姿高度相关。

Conclusion: XFactor证明了无需显式3D几何知识也能实现真正的新视角合成，位姿可迁移性是衡量模型能力的关键标准。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

*Kaixuan Yang,Wei Xiang,Zhenshuai Chen,Tong Jin,Yunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种方向感知的多尺度梯度损失函数，用于红外与可见光图像融合，通过分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量并保留其符号信息，提升边缘清晰度和纹理保留效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习方法在训练时使用梯度幅值损失，但将梯度压缩为幅值会丢失方向信息，导致监督模糊和边缘保真度不理想。

Method: 引入方向感知的多尺度梯度损失，分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量，并在多尺度上保留其符号信息，提供清晰的方向指导。

Result: 在开源模型和多个公共基准测试上的实验表明，该方法能有效提升边缘清晰度、对齐效果和纹理保留质量。

Conclusion: 提出的方向感知多尺度梯度损失在不改变模型架构或训练协议的情况下，显著提升了红外与可见光图像融合的质量。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在不同数据集间部署时面临域偏移问题，包括图像外观（风格）和人群相关解剖特征（内容）的变化，这影响了海马体分割的准确性。

Method: 结合z-归一化进行风格协调，使用双向可变形图像配准策略，将配准网络与分割网络和判别器网络联合训练，生成解剖学上合理的变换以对齐源图像到目标域。

Result: 在合成数据集和三个MRI海马体数据集上的评估显示，该方法优于现有基线。从年轻健康人群迁移到临床痴呆患者时，Dice得分相对标准增强方法提升高达15%，在内容偏移显著的情况下效果最好。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效实现跨不同人群的准确海马体分割，特别适用于存在显著内容偏移的场景。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种量化扩散概率模型中计数幻觉的方法，构建了CountHalluSet数据集套件，并系统分析了不同采样条件对计数幻觉的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型经常产生与现实知识冲突的幻觉样本，但缺乏系统量化这些幻觉的方法，阻碍了解决这一挑战的进展。

Method: 构建包含ToyShape、SimObject和RealHand的CountHalluSet数据集，开发标准化评估协议来量化计数幻觉，并分析不同采样条件的影响。

Result: 研究发现FID等常用评估指标无法一致捕捉计数幻觉，不同采样条件对幻觉水平有显著影响。

Conclusion: 这项工作为系统量化扩散模型中的幻觉现象迈出了第一步，为研究图像生成中的幻觉现象提供了新见解。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在计算开销高、内存消耗大、视觉保真度差的问题，导致时间不一致性和伪影。

Method: 引入时空特征记忆库缓存特征，使用特征最相似传播保持时间一致性，通过交叉注意力图自动提取感兴趣实例的掩码。

Result: 在效率和视觉保真度方面优于现有最先进方法，验证了其优越的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: Edit-Your-Interest提供了一种高效、高质量的零样本视频编辑解决方案，在保持背景完整性的同时实现精确编辑。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoSocial数据集和EgoSoD方法，用于解决AR/VR环境中AI助手在社交互动中缺乏干预时机感知能力的问题，显著提升了干预时机检测和社交互动理解的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AR/VR技术融入日常生活，需要AI从第一人称视角理解人类社交动态。当前LLMs缺乏社交意识，无法判断何时干预，导致频繁且不合时宜的响应，破坏自然对话并影响用户专注度。

Method: 1) 构建包含13,500个社交视频-问题对的EgoSocial数据集；2) 分析现有全模态LLMs在社交上下文线索检测中的表现；3) 提出EgoSoD方法，整合多模态上下文线索到社交思维图中，动态建模参与者和互动。

Result: 实验显示：OLLMs在干预时机检测上表现不佳（Gemini 2.5 Pro仅14.4%）；EgoSoD方法显著提升性能：在干预时机检测上，Phi-4提升45.6%，Gemini 2.5 Pro提升9.9%；在整体社交互动性能上，Phi-4提升20.4%，Gemini 2.5 Pro提升6.9%。

Conclusion: EgoSoD方法通过整合多模态线索和动态社交建模，能够主动检测干预时机和社交互动，精确确定何时干预，有效解决了AI助手在社交环境中的干预时机感知问题。

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Conclusion: 该工作为评估自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠、与人类判断一致的基础框架。

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: VPreg在配准精度、变换质量和逆变换准确性方面优于现有最先进方法，为计算解剖学和形态测量学提供了可靠的微分同胚空间变换。

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Conclusion: 通过LLM增强文本信息熵和超图适配器的多边连接，有效解决了跨模态检索中的熵不平衡问题，显著提升了语义对齐性能。

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

*Meng Yang,Kecheng Chen,Wei Luo,Xianjie Chen,Yong Jia,Mingyue Wang,Fanqiang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于字典驱动先验正则化的测试时自适应方法(DP-TTA)，用于解决瞬变电磁法信号在不同地理区域噪声特性差异导致的去噪性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习去噪模型大多基于模拟或单一真实场景数据训练，忽略了不同地理区域噪声特性的显著差异，导致模型在新环境中的去噪性能下降。

Method: 使用字典学习将TEM信号的内在物理特性(如指数衰减和平滑性)编码为字典驱动先验，在训练时集成到DTEMDNet网络中，在测试时通过最小化基于字典驱动一致性和信号一阶变化的自监督损失来动态适应新环境。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，该方法在TEM去噪性能上显著优于现有TEM去噪方法和TTA方法。

Conclusion: 利用TEM信号的内在物理特性作为先验知识，通过测试时自适应策略可以有效提升模型在新地理环境中的去噪性能。

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了STT-GS策略，通过先采样再传输的方式解决边缘高斯泼溅中的因果困境，使用特征域聚类和联合客户端选择与功率控制来最大化GS质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统边缘资源管理方法强调通信吞吐量或通用学习性能，不适用于专门优化高斯泼溅质量的场景，需要新的GS导向方法。

Method: 提出STT-GS策略：先采样客户端图像作为导频数据预测损失，然后优先分配通信资源给更有价值的客户端；使用FDC选择代表性数据，PTTM减少导频开销，JCSPC框架联合优化客户端选择和功率控制。

Result: 在真实数据集上显著优于现有基准方法，GS导向目标函数能以低采样率（如10%）准确预测，在视图贡献和通信成本间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: STT-GS策略有效解决了边缘高斯泼溅中的资源分配问题，通过两阶段方法实现了GS质量的优化，为边缘场景重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing
training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and

Conclusion: Paper Copilot资源有助于社区追踪变化、诊断失败模式，并为建立更稳健、透明和可靠的同行评审系统提供信息支持。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

TL;DR: 提出了MimicParts框架，通过部位感知风格注入和去噪网络，从语音生成更具表现力的3D人体运动，解决了现有方法在风格多样性和区域运动差异方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从语音生成风格化3D人体运动时存在两个主要问题：一是过度简化风格多样性或忽略区域运动风格差异，二是未能动态适应语音节奏和情感变化，限制了运动真实感。

Method: 提出MimicParts框架，将身体分为不同区域编码局部运动风格，使用部位感知风格注入和部位感知去噪网络，通过部位感知注意力块让节奏和情感线索精确指导每个身体区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于现有方法，能够生成更自然和富有表现力的3D人体运动序列。

Conclusion: MimicParts通过部位感知的方法有效解决了风格化运动生成中的区域差异和动态适应问题，显著提升了运动生成的质量和真实感。

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

Conclusion: 这是首个专门针对PA方法论和应用的全面综述，旨在为研究人员提供清晰的路线图，帮助理解PA相关研究的发展格局。

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了样本级决策的可靠性和缺陷定位的完整性。

Conclusion: 样本中心的多任务学习框架有效解决了工业缺陷检测中样本级决策稳定性问题，提出的评估指标更贴合实际质量控制需求。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在严重的肯定偏见，在否定理解方面表现不佳，特别是在描述性目标检测任务中。

Method: 提出CoVAND数据集生成管道和NegToMe文本标记合并模块，该模块通过将否定词与属性词合并为语义短语来保持正确的极性，并结合LoRA微调方法。

Result: 在挑战性否定基准测试中显著提升性能，在OVDEval上NMS-AP提升高达+10.8分，并降低误报率，可泛化到最先进的视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作在解决真实世界检测应用中的否定理解问题上迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常针对单一向量类型设计，需要为不同结构使用单独模型，这限制了捕捉复杂结构的能力。

Method: 将向量编码为包含实例和几何信息的结构化查询，通过交互模块迭代更新，并使用动态形状约束来优化全局结构和关键点。

Result: 在单结构和多结构向量提取任务上都达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: UniVector通过统一的实例-几何交互框架，成功实现了在单个模型中提取多种向量类型的能力。

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

Conclusion: 该网络在嵌入式系统上实现了超实时人群计数，在保证竞争力的准确度同时具有最快的推理速度。

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型的静态文本描述，缺乏对实时目标状态变化的适应性且容易产生幻觉。

Result: 在MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的广泛实验表明，EPIPTrack在多样化场景中优于现有跟踪器。

Conclusion: EPIPTrack展现出强大的适应性和优越性能，能够有效应对目标状态变化。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了整合查询相关增强和熵感知解码对于改善LVLM有效生成的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at

*MingZe Tang,Jubal Chandy Jacob*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，在视觉语言模型的零样本分类中，对于高性能模型，简单提示词效果最好，详细描述反而降低性能，出现'提示词过拟合'现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索提示词设计对视觉相似类别（如人体姿势）零样本分类的影响，特别是在数据稀缺条件下。

Method: 使用285张COCO数据集图像，评估OpenCLIP、MetaCLIP 2和SigLip等现代VLM模型，采用三层次提示词设计系统增加语言细节。

Result: 高性能模型（MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP）使用最简单提示词时效果最佳，准确率分别为68.8%；添加描述性细节后MetaCLIP 2准确率降至55.1%。低性能SigLP模型在模糊类别上使用详细提示词时表现更好。

Conclusion: 提示词设计对VLM性能有显著影响，高性能模型容易'提示词过拟合'，而低性能模型能从详细提示词中受益。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

Abstract: The development of computer vision algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) applications in urban environments heavily relies on the availability of
large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and
annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding
tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets,
FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB,
depth, semantic labels) across diverse environmental conditions including
varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research
on UAV-based 3D urban scene understanding.

Conclusion: SketchSem3D基准和CymbaDiff方法为户外3D语义场景生成提供了标准化评估工具，并显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

Conclusion: 通过利用MLLM的语义理解能力进行硬负样本挖掘和软标签对齐，显著提升了多模态嵌入模型的判别能力和性能。

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个基于代理的流式基准测试，揭示了跨文化组成和渐进模糊如何影响面部表情识别的鲁棒性。研究发现不同文化群体在模糊条件下的性能退化曲线存在不对称性，混合群体表现出中间模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前面部表情识别评估通常假设同质数据和高质量图像，但实际应用中需要面对文化差异和视觉条件退化。本研究旨在探索跨文化组成和感知退化如何共同影响面部表情识别的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用基于代理的方法，在冻结的CLIP特征空间中训练轻量级残差适配器。代理在5x5网格上移动和交互，环境提供按sigma调度的高斯模糊输入。研究比较了单文化群体和不同比例的混合文化群体。

Result: JAFFE（亚洲）群体在低模糊度下保持较高性能但在中间阶段急剧下降，KDEF（西方）群体退化更均匀。平衡混合群体缓解早期退化，但不平衡设置在高模糊度下放大了多数群体的弱点。

Conclusion: 文化组成和交互结构显著影响面部表情识别在感知条件恶化时的鲁棒性，量化了这些因素如何塑造不同文化群体的性能退化模式。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

Motivation: 尽管视频大语言模型在视频问答方面取得进展，但其内部如何提取和传播视频与文本信息的机制仍不明确，需要深入探索。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析VideoLLMs的内部信息流，研究不同层中跨帧交互和视频-语言整合的模式。

Result: 发现视频问答中：早期到中间层进行跨帧交互；中间层实现视频-语言整合；整合完成后在中间到后期层生成正确答案；通过选择有效信息路径可保持58%的注意力边被抑制时的性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了VideoLLMs进行时序推理的机制，为改进模型可解释性和下游泛化提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

TL;DR: CanvasMAR是一种新颖的视频掩码自回归模型，通过引入画布机制解决现有模型的慢启动问题和误差累积问题，能够用更少的自回归步骤生成高质量视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频掩码自回归模型存在两个主要限制：慢启动问题（早期采样阶段缺乏结构化全局先验）以及在空间和时间维度上的自回归误差累积。

Method: 提出画布机制——对下一帧的模糊全局预测，作为掩码生成的起点；引入组合式无分类器引导，联合放大空间（画布）和时间条件；采用基于噪声的画布增强来提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在BAIR和Kinetics-600基准测试中，CanvasMAR能够用更少的自回归步骤生成高质量视频，在Kinetics-600数据集上取得了显著性能，与基于扩散的方法相媲美。

Conclusion: CanvasMAR通过画布机制有效解决了视频掩码自回归模型的慢启动和误差累积问题，展示了在视频生成任务中的优越性能。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端多模态模型使用不同的编码器和解码器处理输入输出信息，这种分离阻碍了多模态的联合表示学习。

Method: 使用基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一变分自编码器逐步生成和优化模态特定信息，实现编码和解码的统一处理。

Result: 在图像生成、图像描述、视觉问答、文本理解和推理任务中显著优于现有端到端模型，并能与GPT-4V、Gemini Pro等SOTA模型竞争。

Conclusion: MDM有效统一了多模态处理过程，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视角生成模型不支持几何一致的定制化，而定制化模型缺乏显式视角控制，难以统一这两种能力。

Method: 使用特征场表示学习主体身份和几何，结合文本到视频扩散主干增强时空注意力，在推理阶段引入深度感知特征渲染和一致性感知潜在补全。

Result: MVCustom是唯一同时实现忠实多视角生成和定制化的框架。

Conclusion: 提出的MVCustom框架成功解决了多视角定制化任务，在几何一致性和定制保真度方面表现优异。

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型的上下文窗口不断扩大，但扩展的上下文窗口并不保证模型能有效利用上下文，这对实际应用构成挑战。目前的长上下文忠实性评估主要集中在纯文本领域，多模态评估仍局限于短上下文。

Method: 引入MMLongCite基准测试，包含8个不同任务，涵盖6个上下文长度区间，整合了文本、图像和视频等多种模态。

Result: 对最先进的大型视觉语言模型评估显示，它们在处理长多模态上下文时的忠实性有限。深入分析了上下文长度和关键内容位置对模型忠实性的影响。

Conclusion: 需要开发更有效的方法来提升大型视觉语言模型在长多模态上下文中的忠实性，MMLongCite为此提供了重要的评估工具和分析框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉图神经网络(ViG)的图构建方法如KNN在较大图像上计算昂贵，而SVGA等方法存在固定步长尺度导致过度压缩和缺失长距离连接的问题。

Method: 提出对数可扩展图构建(LSGC)方法限制长距离连接数量，构建LogViG混合CNN-GNN模型，并引入高分辨率分支和多尺度特征融合架构。

Result: LogViG在准确率、GMACs和参数量方面均优于现有ViG、CNN和ViT架构。最小模型Ti-LogViG在ImageNet-1K上平均top-1准确率达79.9%，比Vision GNN高1.7%，参数量减少24.3%，GMACs减少35.3%。

Conclusion: 通过LSGC方法在ViG中利用长距离连接可以超越当前最先进的ViG性能。

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出MaskDCPT预训练方法，通过掩码退化分类和图像重建来提升图像恢复任务的性能，在多种退化类型和级别上取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法在图像恢复任务中存在局限性，需要一种能够同时处理多种退化类型的通用预训练方法。

Method: 使用编码器和两个解码器：编码器从掩码低质量图像提取特征，分类解码器识别退化类型，重建解码器重建高质量图像。

Result: 在5D全合一恢复任务中PSNR至少提升3.77dB，真实场景中PIQE降低34.8%，对未见过的退化类型有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaskDCPT为图像恢复任务提供了有效的预训练方法，显著提升了CNN和Transformer的性能，并发布了包含250万样本的UIR-2.5M数据集。

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at

TL;DR: RECODE是一个基于代码反渲染的视觉推理框架，通过将图像逆向工程为可执行代码来解决多模态大语言模型在结构化视觉推理中的精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图表和图表等结构化视觉的精确推理方面存在困难，因为基于像素的感知缺乏验证机制。

Method: 提出RECODE框架：首先生成多个候选程序来重现输入图像，然后使用批评器选择最忠实的重建，并迭代优化代码。

Result: 在CharXiv、ChartQA和Geometry3K等多个视觉推理基准测试中，RECODE显著优于不使用代码或仅使用代码绘制辅助线或裁剪的方法。

Conclusion: 将视觉感知基于可执行代码为更准确和可验证的多模态推理提供了新途径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

*Aya Kaysan Bahjat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动文档分类系统，能够检测图像中的文本内容并将文档分类为四种预定义类别（发票、报告、信件和表格），支持离线图像和实时摄像头捕获，在具有挑战性的成像条件下表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中面临的多种挑战，包括可变光照、任意方向、弯曲或部分遮挡文本、低分辨率和远距离文本等问题，实现混合来源文档在无约束成像场景下的有效分类。

Method: 采用四阶段流水线：图像采集与预处理、使用DBNet++进行文本检测、使用BART进行文本分类，所有功能集成在基于Python和PyQt5的用户界面中。

Result: 在Total-Text数据集上经过10小时测试，文本检测准确率达到92.88%，该数据集包含高分辨率图像并模拟各种困难挑战。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在无约束成像场景下对混合来源文档分类具有实际有效性。

Abstract: An automatic document classification system is presented that detects textual
content in images and classifies documents into four predefined categories
(Invoice, Report, Letter, and Form). The system supports both offline images
(e.g., files on flash drives, HDDs, microSD) and real-time capture via
connected cameras, and is designed to mitigate practical challenges such as
variable illumination, arbitrary orientation, curved or partially occluded
text, low resolution, and distant text. The pipeline comprises four stages:
image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++
(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about
92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution
images simulate a various and very difficult challenges. The results indicate
the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document
categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

TL;DR: 将4D fMRI数据转换为2D活动平铺图视频，使用时空掩码自编码器训练Vision Transformers，发现性能随数据量呈幂律增长，支持跨受试者的状态解码和跨状态的受试者特征解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合fMRI与自然图像之间的模态差距，为fMRI数据构建基础模型。

Method: 将4D fMRI体积数据转换为2D fMRI活动平铺图视频，使用时空掩码自编码器(MAE)框架在Human Connectome Project的2.3K小时fMRI数据上训练Vision Transformers。

Result: 掩码fMRI建模性能随数据集大小按严格幂律缩放规律提升，下游分类基准显示模型学习到丰富表示，支持跨受试者的细粒度状态解码和跨状态变化的受试者特定特征解码。

Conclusion: 这项工作是为fMRI数据构建基础模型的持续开放科学项目的一部分，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional
MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality
gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation
models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于点云分割的新类发现方法，通过结构因果模型学习基础类和新型类之间的因果关系，实现无标注新类的分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决点云分割中的新类发现问题，旨在利用已标注的基础类监督来分割未标注的新型类，关键在于建立点表示与类别标签之间的精确相关性。

Method: 使用结构因果模型重新形式化3D-NCD问题，提出联合学习因果表示和推理的方法，包括消除混淆变量的因果表示原型和基于图结构的因果推理。

Result: 在3D和2D NCD语义分割上的大量实验和可视化结果证明了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过因果表示学习和推理，能够有效解决点云分割中的新类发现问题，提高分割准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Honey-Data-15M数据集和HoneyPipe数据清洗管道，解决了开源多模态大语言模型数据质量差的问题，训练出的Bee-8B模型在完全开源模型中达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前完全开源的多模态大语言模型落后于专有模型，主要原因是监督微调数据质量存在显著差距，现有开源数据集存在广泛噪声且缺乏复杂推理数据。

Method: 1) 引入Honey-Data-15M数据集，包含约1500万QA对，采用多重清洗技术和新颖的双层CoT增强策略；2) 开发HoneyPipe数据整理管道和DataStudio框架；3) 基于该数据集训练Bee-8B模型。

Result: Bee-8B在完全开源多模态大语言模型中达到新的SOTA水平，性能与半开源模型如InternVL3.5-8B相当甚至在某些方面超越。

Conclusion: 通过专注于数据质量的原则性方法，可以开发出与半开源模型具有高度竞争力的完全开源多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GPU并行计算的SfM方法，通过加速标准SfM流程中的关键阶段，在保持重建精度的同时实现了约40倍的速度提升，能够处理数千张图像的大规模场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM方法如COLMAP和GLOMAP在CPU上实现存在计算开销大的问题，而基于深度学习的SfM方法如VGGSfM和VGGT在处理大规模场景时GPU内存消耗急剧增加。需要一种既能保持精度又能高效处理大规模场景的SfM解决方案。

Method: 利用GPU并行计算加速标准SfM流程中的每个关键阶段，基于稀疏感知的束调整优化技术，在统一的全局SfM框架中同时加速束调整和全局定位。

Result: 在包含5000张图像的大规模数据集上，相比COLMAP实现了约40倍的速度提升，同时重建精度相当甚至有所改善，而VGGSfM和VGGT则因内存不足无法运行。

Conclusion: 该方法成功释放了GPU并行计算的潜力，为大规模场景的快速3D重建提供了高效解决方案，在速度和精度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

TL;DR: 提出Generative Universal Verifier概念，构建ViVerBench基准，训练OmniVerifier-7B通用视觉验证器，并通过OmniVerifier-TTS测试时缩放范式提升多模态推理的视觉验证能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在多模态推理中缺乏可靠的视觉结果验证能力，与人类水平的可靠视觉验证存在显著差距。

Method: 构建ViVerBench基准评估视觉结果，设计自动化流水线构建大规模视觉验证数据，训练OmniVerifier-7B通用验证器，并提出OmniVerifier-TTS测试时缩放范式。

Result: OmniVerifier-7B在ViVerBench上提升8.3分，OmniVerifier-TTS在T2I-ReasonBench和GenEval++上分别提升3.7和4.3分，优于现有并行测试时缩放方法。

Conclusion: 通过赋予多模态推理可靠的视觉验证能力，OmniVerifier推进了生成过程中的可靠反思和可扩展的测试时优化，向更可信可控的下一代推理系统迈进。

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常生活中，人们的注意力被所消费和看到的内容高度影响。吸引和保持注意力（即视觉趣味性）至关重要。随着大型多模态模型在视觉和文本数据上的训练能力不断提升，研究希望探索这些模型在多大程度上能够理解视觉趣味性概念。

Method: 通过比较分析人类评估与GPT-4o预测的一致性，研究GPT-4o对视觉趣味性的理解能力。然后利用GPT-4o有效标注图像对的趣味性，将这些数据用作训练数据，将知识蒸馏到学习排序模型中。

Result: 研究发现人类与GPT-4o在视觉趣味性评估上存在部分一致性。GPT-4o在捕捉视觉趣味性概念方面表现最佳，优于现有最先进方法。这使得能够有效标注图像对的趣味性，为训练学习排序模型提供数据。

Conclusion: 该研究为深入理解人类兴趣开辟了道路，展示了大型多模态模型在捕捉视觉趣味性方面的潜力，并为构建更有效的兴趣评估系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

TL;DR: 提出一种训练策略，允许在训练过程中移除光流估计器中的成本体积，显著提高推理速度并减少内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经验观察到成本体积在其他网络部分充分训练后重要性降低，但其计算和空间复杂度限制了处理速度和输入帧分辨率。

Method: 引入一种训练策略，在训练过程中逐步移除成本体积，创建了三种不同计算预算的模型。

Result: 最准确模型达到最先进精度，速度提高1.2倍，内存占用降低6倍；最快模型能以20FPS处理全高清帧，仅使用500MB GPU内存。

Conclusion: 通过移除成本体积的训练策略，可以在保持精度的同时显著提升光流估计的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

Conclusion: 该方法为热成像隐蔽武器检测提供了有效的解决方案，通过架构改进和新的数据集推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

Motivation: VQ-VAE在自监督学习中存在码本崩溃问题，现有方法使用隐式静态码本或联合优化整个码本，但限制了码本学习能力并降低了重建质量。

Method: Group-VQ对码本进行分组优化，每组独立优化，组内联合优化；同时提出训练后码本重采样方法，可在训练后调整码本大小。

Result: 在各种图像重建实验中，Group-VQ在重建指标上表现出改进性能，训练后码本采样方法实现了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Conclusion: Group-VQ改善了码本利用率和重建性能之间的权衡，训练后码本重采样提供了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个专门针对渲染视频的无参考视频质量评估方法，包括一个大型渲染视频数据集和相应的质量评估指标，解决了现有方法对渲染视频评估偏差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无参考视频质量评估方法和数据集主要针对摄像机拍摄的视频，直接应用于渲染视频会产生偏差预测，因为渲染视频更容易出现时间伪影。

Method: 创建了一个大型渲染视频数据集，包含各种3D场景和渲染设置，并设计了专门针对渲染视频的NR-VQA指标，同时考虑图像质量和时间稳定性。

Result: 提出的NR-VQA指标在渲染视频上表现出优于现有方法的性能，并能有效评估超采样方法和实时渲染中的帧生成策略。

Conclusion: 该研究为渲染视频质量评估提供了专用解决方案，填补了现有方法的空白，在计算机图形应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

TL;DR: DepthVLA通过集成预训练的深度预测模块，增强了VLA模型的空间推理能力，在真实世界和模拟环境中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在需要精确空间推理的任务上表现不佳，因为它们继承了VLMs有限的空间推理能力，且依赖大量动作数据预训练来在3D空间中定位VLMs，这降低了训练效率且仍不足以实现准确的空间理解。

Method: DepthVLA采用混合变换器设计，统一了VLM、深度变换器和动作专家，通过完全共享注意力形成端到端模型，并明确通过预训练的深度预测模块融入空间感知。

Result: 在真实世界任务中达到78.5% vs. 65.0%的进展，在LIBERO模拟器中达到94.9% vs. 93.6%，在Simpler模拟器中达到74.8% vs. 58.8%，均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DepthVLA是一种简单有效的VLA架构，通过显式融入空间感知显著提升了空间推理能力，在多个环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合SDF和3DGS的优势，实现了更灵活准确的动态场景表示，降低了对数据要求的依赖。

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

*Feng-Qi Cui,Yu-Tong Guo,Tianyue Zheng,Jinyang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GLSDA框架，利用预训练大模型的语义先验增强WiFi手势识别的泛化能力和语义表达能力，通过双路径CSI编码、多尺度语义编码器和语义感知软监督实现跨域手势识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WiFi手势识别方法存在泛化能力有限和语义表达能力不足的问题，主要由于CSI的领域敏感性以及缺乏高级手势抽象。

Method: 设计双路径CSI编码管道捕获几何和动态手势模式，使用多尺度语义编码器学习鲁棒时序嵌入并通过跨模态注意力对齐语义，引入语义感知软监督方案编码类间相关性，开发鲁棒双蒸馏策略压缩模型。

Result: 在Widar3.0基准测试中，GLSDA在域内和跨域手势识别任务中均优于最先进方法，同时显著减小模型大小和推理延迟。

Conclusion: GLSDA为实际AIoT应用中的通用RF手势接口提供了可扩展和可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于认知分类的统一空间推理基准Spatial-DISE，包含四个基本象限的分类，并通过自动化流程生成了包含评估和训练数据的数据集。评估显示当前视觉语言模型在空间推理能力上与人类存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，特别是内在动态空间推理这一人类空间认知的基本方面。

Method: 基于认知分类法将任务分为四个基本象限，开发了可扩展的自动化流程来生成多样且可验证的空间推理问题，构建了Spatial-DISE数据集。

Result: 对28个最先进的视觉语言模型进行全面评估，发现当前模型在空间推理能力上与人类存在较大且一致的差距，特别是在多步骤多视图空间推理方面。

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE为未来研究提供了稳健的框架、有价值的数据集和明确的方向，旨在实现类人空间智能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要针对扩散模型或自回归模型，忽视了掩码生成模型这一重要替代方案。

Method: 重新定义转移概率，将去掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，并采用移除KL约束、应用缩减策略和过滤低质量样本等策略。

Result: 在标准T2I基准测试和偏好对齐方面显著改进基础模型Show-o，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO成功将RL引入掩码生成模型，为文本到图像生成提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-Adapter是一个用于高分辨率文本引导图像修复的有效框架，能够实现4K+分辨率，同时保持内容一致性和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于较低分辨率，随着分辨率和纹理复杂度的增加，内容一致性和提示对齐这两个关键挑战变得更加困难。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器架构：双上下文适配器学习掩码和非掩码区域的连贯性以建立全局结构一致性；参考补丁适配器实现补丁级注意力机制，通过自适应特征融合保持局部细节保真度。

Result: 实验表明Patch-Adapter不仅解决了大规模修复中常见的伪影问题，还在OpenImages和Photo-Concept-Bucket数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在感知质量和文本提示遵循方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该双阶段架构通过解耦全局语义和局部细化，独特地解决了高分辨率修复中的可扩展性差距问题。

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDS是一种用于自动驾驶异构场景的协作感知方法，通过域分离解决特征差异问题，在保持高效推理的同时提高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法假设所有智能体使用相同编码器，不适用于实际异构场景。现有方法特征对齐易受域间隙噪声影响，且基于transformer的域适应模块在移动设备上推理效率低。

Method: 提出CoDS方法，包含轻量级空间-通道调整器(LSCR)和基于域分离的分布对齐(DADS)两个特征对齐模块，使用域对齐互信息(DAMI)损失进行训练，采用全卷积架构确保高效推理。

Result: 大量实验表明CoDS能有效缓解异构场景中的特征差异，在检测精度和推理效率之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: CoDS通过域分离方法成功解决了异构协作感知中的特征差异问题，实现了精度与效率的平衡，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 当前方法主要在2D像素上操作，难以分离对物理场景属性的选择性。需要开发能够直接表征神经元对3D场景属性选择性的方法。

Method: 使用可微分渲染管道优化可变形网格，参数化网格变形为径向基函数，学习最大化神经元响应的偏移和尺度，同时强制几何规律性。

Result: 应用于猴子V4区域模型，能够探测神经元对可解释3D因素（如姿态和光照）的选择性。

Conclusion: 该方法将逆向图形学与系统神经科学连接起来，提供了一种超越传统基于像素方法的、基于物理基础的3D刺激来探测神经选择性的途径。

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索近红外高光谱成像技术在食品质量分析中的有效应用，比较不同建模方法（CNN vs PLS）在食品参数预测中的性能差异。

Method: 通过四项研究，使用卷积神经网络（CNN）和偏最小二乘法（PLS）进行建模分析，包括2D CNN增强光谱卷积层的方法。

Result: CNN在空间-光谱联合分析中优于PLS，特别是在需要化学和物理视觉信息的参数建模中。PLS在分析样品化学参数平均含量时表现同等良好。CNN能生成更平滑的化学分布图。

Conclusion: CNN在食品质量分析中具有优势，特别是在需要空间分布信息的场景下，而PLS在平均含量分析中仍是推荐方法。同时开发了两个开源Python工具包用于快速建模和交叉验证。

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Conclusion: VIST3A框架成功地将文本到视频生成和3D重建能力结合，为文本到3D生成提供了有效的解决方案，并在多个评估中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Result: 在9种先进VPR方法和6个基准数据集上的综合评估表明，这些度量在区分正确和错误匹配方面表现优异，计算开销可忽略，适用于实时机器人应用。

Conclusion: 所提出的不确定性度量方法无需额外训练或架构修改，能有效提升VPR系统在多变环境条件下的精度-召回性能，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

Conclusion: 该模型具有高度适应性，可用于开发实际场景中的端到端情感识别系统。

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

Conclusion: 面部动作单元是有效的非瞬态特征，能够支持高效的增量学习，在复杂情绪识别任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera
fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary
geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight
architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the
state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To
preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we
introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned
distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student,
and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE
compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with
real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

Conclusion: ATR-UMOD数据集和PCDF方法为解决无人机在多样化条件下的目标检测问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

TL;DR: 提出AVAR-Net，一种轻量级高效的视听异常识别框架，结合Wav2Vec2音频特征提取和MobileViT视觉特征提取，通过早期融合和MTCN网络建模跨模态关系，在自建的VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率。


<details>

Motivation: 现有异常识别方法仅依赖视觉数据，在遮挡、低光照等挑战条件下不可靠，且缺乏大规模同步视听数据集阻碍了多模态异常识别的发展。

Method: 使用Wav2Vec2提取音频特征，MobileViT提取视觉特征，早期融合机制结合模态，MTCN网络学习融合表示中的长期时序依赖关系。

Result: 在VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率，在XD-Violence数据集上达到88.56%平均精度，比现有最优方法提升2.8%。

Conclusion: AVAR-Net框架具有高效性、有效性和泛化能力，VAAR数据集为推进多模态异常识别研究提供了实用基准。

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了基于DINOv2的少样本异常检测器的对抗攻击脆弱性和不确定性校准问题，提出了攻击检测和不确定性估计的基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DINOv2的异常检测器在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性和不确定性校准能力尚未得到充分研究，这限制了其在安全关键应用中的可信部署。

Method: 在AnomalyDINO基础上，通过添加轻量级线性头进行白盒梯度攻击，并使用Platt缩放对异常分数进行后处理以进行不确定性估计。

Result: 研究发现微小扰动可导致最近邻关系翻转，造成误分类；原始异常分数校准性差；校准后验在对抗样本上具有更高预测熵，可用于攻击检测。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性和不确定性量化是异常检测系统可信部署的必备能力，本文建立了评估协议和基准方法。

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过上下文感知和分布对齐机制，成功解决了现有方法在处理多样化退化图像时的局限性，实现了高质量的超分辨率重建。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

Conclusion: EditCast3D为将基础模型集成到3D编辑管道提供了一个可扩展且通用的范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

Motivation: 当前3D视线估计方法在跨域泛化方面存在困难，主要原因是标注数据稀缺和标注数据多样性不足。

Method: 构建多样化的无标注面部图像集，采用标准伪标签策略，设计奖励模型评估伪标签可靠性，结合视觉嵌入和语义线索计算置信度分数，选择高质量伪标签进行损失计算。

Conclusion: OmniGaze不仅是一个有效的3D视线估计方法，还可作为可扩展的数据引擎，显著提升跨域泛化性能。

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

Conclusion: FlashWorld通过创新的双模式训练策略，成功实现了快速且高质量的3D场景生成，为3D内容创作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

Motivation: 在医学影像中生成健康的反事实图像对于异常检测和分析工具应用具有重要意义，但现有方法难以平衡异常去除与个体特征保留。

Method: 使用去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs），不仅以健康图像为初始条件，还以合成的病理图像为最终条件，将病理图像作为结构信息先验来指导生成过程。

Result: DDBM在分割和异常检测任务上优于先前提出的扩散模型和全监督方法。

Conclusion: DDBM能够生成更准确匹配患者解剖结构同时选择性去除病理的健康反事实图像。

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

*Jonghyun Park,Minhyuk Seo,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS)方法，通过重新表述查询来增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，实现查询级别的风险评估，并自适应引导激活以生成安全且有用的响应，无需迭代输出调整的开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI模型面临的关键挑战是确保对良性查询提供有用响应，同时拒绝恶意查询。模型通常容易受到嵌入有害意图的多模态查询的攻击。现有安全对齐方法存在训练成本高或推理时过度拒绝和速度慢的问题。

Method: 重新表述查询以增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，进行查询级别的风险评估，根据评估风险自适应引导激活生成响应，避免迭代输出调整的开销。

Result: 在多模态安全和效用基准测试中，RAS显著降低了攻击成功率，保持了通用任务性能，并提高了推理速度，优于先前的推理时防御方法。

Conclusion: RAS方法有效解决了多模态查询的安全对齐问题，在保证安全性的同时维持了模型效用和推理效率。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

*Fabio Musio,Norman Juchler,Kaiyuan Yang,Suprosanna Shit,Chinmay Prabhakar,Bjoern Menze,Sven Hirsch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于U-Net骨架化和A*图连接的基线算法，用于从脑Willis环(CoW)图像中提取中心线图和形态特征，在解剖学准确性和特征鲁棒性方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Willis环是大脑中关键的动脉网络，与脑血管疾病密切相关。虽然体素级分割是自动化评估的重要第一步，但完整的定量分析需要中心线表示。然而，传统骨架化技术因CoW复杂几何结构而难以提取可靠中心线，且公开可用的中心线数据集稀缺。

Method: 使用细化骨架化算法从TopCoW数据集（包含200名卒中患者的MRA和CTA图像）中提取和整理中心线图和形态特征。开发了结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接的基线算法，在保留测试集上评估解剖学准确性和特征鲁棒性。

Result: 基线算法始终以高精度重建图拓扑（F1=1），参考图和预测图之间的平均欧几里得节点距离小于一个体素。段半径、长度和分叉比等特征表现出强鲁棒性，中位相对误差低于5%，皮尔逊相关系数高于0.95。

Conclusion: 结果表明基于学习的骨架化结合图连接对于解剖学上合理的中心线提取具有实用性。强调了超越简单体素测量、评估解剖学准确性和特征鲁棒性的重要性。数据集和基线算法已发布以支持进一步方法开发和临床研究。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

TL;DR: LiFMCR是一个用于多微透镜阵列光场相机配准的新数据集，提供两个高分辨率Raytrix R32光场相机的同步图像序列和Vicon运动捕捉系统记录的高精度6自由度位姿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光场数据集局限于单相机设置且缺乏外部真实值，无法支持多相机光场配准方法的严格评估。

Method: 提供了两种互补的配准方法：基于RANSAC的跨视图点云3D变换估计，以及从单光场图像估计6自由度位姿的光场PnP算法，两者都显式集成了光场相机模型。

Result: 实验显示与真实值有很强的对齐性，支持可靠的多视角光场处理。

Conclusion: LiFMCR数据集和提供的配准方法为多相机光场配准提供了可靠的评估基准。

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro
lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets
are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种循环自监督扩散框架(CSS-Diff)，用于从真实低场MRI数据合成高场MRI图像，通过循环一致性约束确保解剖结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI虽然更便宜、更易获取且更安全，但存在分辨率低和信噪比差的问题。合成高场MRI可以减少对昂贵采集的依赖，但现有方法存在临床保真度差距，需要保持解剖保真度、增强细粒度结构细节并弥合图像对比度领域差距。

Method: 提出了循环自监督扩散框架，核心思想是在循环一致性约束下重新制定基于扩散的合成。包含两个新过程：切片间差距感知网络通过对比学习对齐切片间不一致性；局部结构校正网络通过掩码和扰动补丁的自重建增强局部特征恢复。

Result: 在跨场合成任务中实现了最先进性能(PSNR: 31.80±2.70 dB, SSIM: 0.943±0.102, LPIPS: 0.0864±0.0689)。相比原始低场MRI，显著改善了细粒度解剖结构保真度(左脑白质误差从12.1%降至2.1%，皮层从4.2%降至3.7%)。

Conclusion: CSS-Diff能够合成在数量上可靠且在解剖学上一致的图像，解决了低场到高场MRI合成的关键挑战。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

TL;DR: UniCalli是一个统一的扩散框架，用于中文书法的列级识别和生成，通过联合训练实现字符结构保持与风格布局先验的协同提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么生成高质量单字但忽略页面级美学（如连笔和间距），要么尝试页面合成但牺牲书法正确性，无法平衡质量与整体布局。

Method: 采用非对称噪声和栅格化框图提供空间先验，在合成、标注和未标注数据的混合集上训练统一的扩散模型，联合进行识别和生成任务。

Result: 模型在生成质量上达到最先进水平，具有更好的连笔连续性和布局保真度，同时识别性能更强，并能成功扩展到甲骨文和埃及象形文字等其他古代文字。

Conclusion: 联合训练识别和生成任务能够相互促进，形成概念级抽象，在有限数据场景下尤其有效，为书法计算复制提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

Motivation: 为了在轻量级模型中提供全面的多模态理解和语音生成能力，引领轻量级模型领域发展，并支持下一代智能交互系统。

Method: 采用多阶段训练策略，包括多模态预训练、语音对话和音视频交互的后训练，并精心构建多轮训练数据集以增强长期对话能力。

Result: 实验表明InteractiveOmni显著优于领先的开源模型，在长期记忆能力方面表现突出。4B版本在通用基准测试中可与Qwen2.5-Omni-7B相媲美，且仅用50%模型大小就能保留8B版本97%的性能。

Conclusion: InteractiveOmni在图像、音频、视频理解和语音生成任务上达到了同类尺寸模型的最先进水平，为下一代智能交互系统提供了可访问的开源基础。

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

Motivation: 现有基准很少真正考察视觉理解和生成能力的整合，要么孤立评估这两种能力，要么忽视它们内在耦合的任务。

Method: 设计了一个包含可验证中间推理步骤、独特真实值和可重复评分协议的综合性基准，每个任务都双向耦合，要求模型利用概念理解指导视觉合成，或利用生成作为分析推理的认知支架。

Result: 通过对最先进的统一模型、仅生成模型和仅理解模型的广泛评估，揭示了显著的性能差异和跨模态依赖性。

Conclusion: 为理解这些能力何时以及如何相互增强提供了新见解，并为推进统一模型建立了可靠基础。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决故事续写中有效利用先前视觉上下文同时确保与当前文本输入语义对齐的挑战，避免误导或不相关信息的影响。

Method: 使用CLIP模型检索语义对齐的先前图像，在无相关图像时自适应限制扩散过程早期阶段的视觉条件影响，并通过LLM重新标注噪声数据集提升数据质量。

Result: 定量结果和人工评估显示，AVC在连贯性、语义一致性和视觉保真度方面优于强基线，特别是在先前视觉与当前输入冲突的挑战性场景中。

Conclusion: AVC框架能够有效利用视觉上下文，同时避免不相关信息的影响，在故事续写任务中实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

Motivation: 随着扩散模型在视觉内容生成中的广泛应用，证明作者身份和保护版权变得至关重要，特别是当模型所有者保持模型私有时，需要第三方验证方案

Method: 通过将哈希函数集成到噪声采样过程中，利用初始噪声与生成视觉内容的高度相关性，将随机种子作为水印，使用零知识证明保护种子隐私

Conclusion: NoisePrints提供了一种实用且可扩展的版权保护方案，通过种子作为不可伪造的作者证明，增强了水印移除的难度

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

Motivation: 现有3D LLM缺乏能够同时捕获语义和几何信息的统一3D表示，导致定位性能差或过度依赖外部模块，阻碍了定位与空间推理的无缝集成。

Method: 提出双路径池化机制，将几何特征与语义和位置线索紧密对齐，构建基于图像块的统一3D表示；引入Grounded Chain-of-Thought数据集，包含3D边界框标注和集成定位的推理路径。

Result: GS-Reasoner在3D视觉定位上取得令人印象深刻的结果，显著增强了空间推理能力，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: GS-Reasoner建立了统一且自包含的3D空间推理框架，证明3D视觉定位是空间推理的基石，通过紧密集成定位与推理实现了性能突破。

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出Trajectory Field表示方法，将视频表示为每个像素的连续3D轨迹函数，并开发Trace Anything神经网络一次性预测整个轨迹场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中像素随时间形成连续3D轨迹，这是理解动态的基本单元，需要有效的时空表示来建模视频动态。

Method: 使用轨迹场表示视频，为每个像素预测一组控制点参数化B样条轨迹，Trace Anything模型通过单次前向传播预测整个轨迹场。

Result: 在新轨迹场估计基准上达到SOTA，在点跟踪基准上表现有竞争力；效率显著提升；展现出目标条件操作、运动预测等涌现能力。

Conclusion: 轨迹场表示和Trace Anything模型为视频动态建模提供了有效解决方案，实现了高效准确的轨迹预测和多种应用能力。

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysMaster通过物理表征学习和强化学习来提升视频生成模型的物理感知能力，使其生成更符合物理规律的视频


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型虽然能生成视觉逼真的视频，但往往违反物理定律，限制了其作为'世界模型'的能力

Method: 使用PhysEncoder从输入图像中提取物理信息作为额外条件，结合强化学习和人类反馈优化物理表征，采用端到端的直接偏好优化(DPO)方法

Result: PhysMaster在简单代理任务上证明了其物理感知能力，并能泛化到广泛的物理场景

Conclusion: PhysMaster通过强化学习范式中的表征学习，为物理感知视频生成提供了通用且可插拔的解决方案

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

### [104] [From Literal to Liberal: A Meta-Prompting Framework for Eliciting Human-Aligned Exception Handling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12864)
*Imran Khan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RID框架，一种低计算成本的元提示技术，用于在零样本情况下让LLM进行人类对齐的异常处理，显著提升决策与人类常识的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs作为智能代理系统存在规则刚性缺陷，过度遵循显式规则导致决策与人类常识和意图不一致，而传统的监督微调方法计算成本高且难以普及。

Method: RID框架通过结构化认知模式，引导模型解构任务、分类规则、权衡冲突结果并最终决策，是一种零样本元提示技术。

Result: 在20个需要细微判断的场景基准测试中，RID框架达到95%的人类对齐分数，显著优于基线（80%）和思维链提示（75%），且产生更高质量的意图驱动推理。

Conclusion: RID框架提供了一种实用、易用且有效的方法，引导LLM从字面指令遵循转向自由、目标导向的推理，为构建更可靠实用的AI代理铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepPlanner是一个端到端的强化学习框架，通过熵基优势函数和选择性样本加权来增强深度研究代理的规划能力，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的结果且训练成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖推理阶段的隐式规划，要么引入显式规划器但没有系统性地解决如何优化规划阶段的问题。研究发现，在标准强化学习下，规划标记的熵显著高于其他动作标记，揭示了未优化的不确定决策点。

Method: 提出DeepPlanner框架，通过熵基优势函数为高熵标记分配更大的更新，并选择性加权规划密集型rollouts的样本级优势。

Result: 在七个深度研究基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DeepPlanner提高了规划质量，并在显著降低的训练预算下实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DeepPlanner通过系统性地优化规划阶段，有效增强了深度研究代理的规划能力，为复杂任务的长时程规划提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action
generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle
complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches
either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit
planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.
As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),
planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,
revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address
this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively
enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes
token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to
high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for
planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research
benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves
state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

TL;DR: Sentinel是首个用于形式化评估LLM具身代理物理安全性的框架，通过语义、规划和轨迹三个层次进行验证，基于时序逻辑而非启发式规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式规则或主观LLM判断，无法精确评估LLM具身代理在物理环境中的安全性，需要形式化方法来确保安全要求得到满足。

Method: 采用多级验证管道：语义层将自然语言安全要求形式化为时序逻辑公式；规划层验证LLM生成的高层行动计划；轨迹层合并执行轨迹为计算树进行最终安全检查。

Result: 在VirtualHome和ALFRED环境中评估多个LLM具身代理，发现Sentinel能够暴露先前方法忽略的安全违规，并提供故障模式分析。

Conclusion: 通过将物理安全基于时序逻辑并在多个层次应用验证方法，Sentinel为系统评估LLM具身代理提供了严谨基础，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical
safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic,
plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules
or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in
formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state
invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a
multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive
natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the
LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with
the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals
generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect
unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple
execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently
verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety
check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate
multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our
experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and
applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a
rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in
physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous
methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两车碰撞占道路事故70%，手动编码驾驶员危险行为数据不可靠且劳动密集，需要自动化解决方案来提高数据有效性和可解释性。

Method: 使用MTCF五年两车碰撞数据，微调Llama 3.2 1B模型处理事故叙述，并与随机森林、XGBoost、CatBoost和神经网络等传统方法对比。

Result: 微调LLM总体准确率80%，优于所有基线模型，在不平衡数据场景表现突出。概率推理分析显示分心驾驶增加"一般不安全驾驶"概率，双方分心最大化"双方危险行为"概率，青少年驾驶显著提高"速度和停车违规"概率。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模自动化驾驶员危险行为检测提供稳健可解释的解决方案，为交通安全分析和干预开辟新机会。

Abstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second
decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle
crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway
crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying
Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,
yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by
inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an
innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to
automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the
validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of
two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on
detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional
machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a
neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,
surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in
scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a
probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original
test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver
distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one
driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving";
distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took
Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the
probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical
methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated
DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and
intervention.

TL;DR: 本文主张将时间序列分析重新构想为基于LLM的推理任务，强调因果结构和可解释性，而非仅利用LLM的数值回归能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列分析需要超越表面趋势，理解驱动变化的深层力量。现有LLM方法大多忽视其深层推理潜力，仅使用数值回归能力。

Method: 将时间序列分析重新定义为推理任务，利用LLM的多模态输入整合能力，重点关注因果结构和可解释性。

Result: 通过这种转变，时间序列分析能够实现更接近人类理解的方式，在复杂现实环境中提供透明和上下文感知的洞察。

Conclusion: LLM在时间序列分析中的有效应用应侧重于推理能力而非数值回归，这有助于建立更符合人类认知的、可解释的分析框架。

Abstract: Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition,
trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world
settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events
unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the
actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating
multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain
cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most
existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and
ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time
series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and
explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned
understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex
real-world environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于偏好的奖励修复方法，通过从人类偏好中学习一个加性的、状态转移相关的修正项来自动修复人工设计的代理奖励函数，解决了奖励函数错配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工设计的奖励函数经常与人类真实目标不一致，导致策略错配；而从头学习奖励函数需要大量人类偏好数据，成本高昂。

Method: PBRR框架通过目标探索策略和新的偏好学习目标，学习对代理奖励函数的加性修正项，仅需修正少量关键状态转移即可恢复最优性能。

Result: 在表格域中证明PBRR的累积遗憾与现有偏好学习RL方法相当；在奖励黑客基准测试中，PBRR始终优于基线方法，需要更少的偏好数据来学习高性能策略。

Conclusion: PBRR能有效利用现有代理奖励函数，通过少量偏好数据学习修正项，比从头学习奖励函数更高效，解决了奖励错配问题。

Abstract: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are
frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus
act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often
induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true
objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves
learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over
pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair
(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy
reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term
from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that
are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only
a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and
correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a
new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a
cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based
RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR
consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch
from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,
requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

TL;DR: 提出了一个包含欲望生成和目标管理的情绪认知框架，使基于大语言模型的智能体能够模拟人类情绪状态，在决策过程中实现与人类的情感对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的智能体在情感认知方面存在严重局限：无法模拟连接虚拟与现实服务所需的有限理性；缺乏经过实证验证的将情绪嵌入智能体决策架构的整合机制。

Method: 构建了一个情绪认知框架，包含状态演化、欲望生成、目标优化、决策生成和行动执行等完整决策过程，并在专有多智能体交互环境中实现该框架。

Result: 实验结果表明，受该框架控制的智能体不仅表现出与其情绪状态一致的行为，而且在与其他类型智能体的比较评估中，展现出更高的生态效度，其决策结果显著更接近人类行为模式。

Conclusion: 该情绪认知框架成功实现了基于大语言模型的智能体与人类之间的情感对齐，能够模拟更接近真实人类的情感决策过程。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent
virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions
within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit
severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded
rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack
empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent
decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework
incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve
emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete
decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution,
desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action
execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary
multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with
their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent
types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes
that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的深度推理虽然能提升复杂任务性能，但对所有问题都应用深度推理计算成本过高，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 使用小型LLM生成初始答案，大型LLM进行验证，如果答案正确则直接采用，否则大型LLM执行深度推理。

Result: 对于简单问题，大型LLM的计算成本降低超过50%，准确率损失可忽略不计，复杂任务上仍保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该互补代理系统在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本，为高效使用LLM提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that
chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance
on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by
enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is
computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary
agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an
initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer
is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning.
Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the
computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy
loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

Conclusion: EvoTest提供了一种无需梯度更新的有效测试时学习方法，显著提升了AI代理在陌生环境中的适应能力。

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn
complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but
clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical
utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we
first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a
new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several
consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to
the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,
memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by
our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework
that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the
entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor
Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode
transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This
configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective
state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.
On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,
outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more
complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable
of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win
any.

Conclusion: 提出的感知模型能够有效评估学习模型的效用，为自动驾驶车辆确定合适的感知系统，验证了该函数能够找到正确的自动驾驶感知方案。

Abstract: The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving
and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research
community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep
Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles
(AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately
perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to
control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based
analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the
driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom
dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a
DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the
utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model
instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection
task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'
performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show
three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,
SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the
AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.)
still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892,
truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values,
confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed
function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above
encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of
learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.

TL;DR: 提出了状态-动作联合攻击(SAJA)框架，通过协同利用状态和动作扰动来攻击多智能体深度强化学习模型，相比单独攻击更有效且隐蔽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究只关注状态攻击或动作攻击，未能有效联合两者。简单组合状态和动作扰动无法发挥协同效应，需要开发更有效的联合攻击方法。

Method: SAJA框架包含两个阶段：状态攻击阶段使用多步梯度上升法结合演员和评论家网络计算对抗状态；动作攻击阶段基于扰动状态，使用评论家网络通过梯度上升生成最终对抗动作，并添加启发式正则化器增强效果。

Result: 在Multi-Agent Particle Environment中的评估表明，SAJA比单独的状态或动作攻击效果更好且更隐蔽，现有防御方法无法抵御其攻击。

Conclusion: SAJA框架成功实现了状态和动作攻击的协同效应，为多智能体深度强化学习的安全性研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for
cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic
gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies
focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider
how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations
such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential
synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack
(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two
important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent
method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an
adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed
state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final
adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the
distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added
into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.
We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating
that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only
attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its

Abstract: Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory
models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of
human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game
model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the
input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based
on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically
impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired
generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode
collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator
consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing
studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,
lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit
cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and
identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends
to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading
the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions
v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel
approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),
which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game
equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a
more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a
suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and
two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance
improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Liesbeth Allein,Nataly Pineda-Castañeda,Andrea Rocci,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型在隐式因果链发现任务中的机制性因果推理能力，发现LLMs主要通过关联模式匹配而非真正的因果推理来生成因果链。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs如何理解因果关系中的中间因果步骤，以及它们是否能够进行机制性因果推理，特别是在论证情境中。

Method: 使用九个LLMs生成给定因果对之间的所有可能中间因果步骤，数据来自气候变化讨论的论证研究资源，并进行诊断性评估。

Result: LLMs在生成的因果步骤数量和粒度上存在差异，虽然总体上自一致且对中间连接有信心，但主要依赖关联模式匹配而非真正的因果推理。人类评估确认了生成链的逻辑连贯性。

Conclusion: 本研究为推进论证情境中的隐式机制性因果推理研究提供了基线方法、诊断评估见解和带有因果链的基准数据集。

Abstract: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps
explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these
questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic
evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible
intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain
structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation
studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.
Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the
intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are
mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal
reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and
integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery
approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with
causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,
mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

TL;DR: 提出基于众包QoE数据的移动网络覆盖和弱区分析框架，使用OC-SVM算法计算覆盖范围，能有效识别城市环境中的信号弱区。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动网络运营商需要准确评估网络覆盖和识别服务弱区，以提升用户体验质量(QoE)。

Method: 使用OC-SVM算法建模覆盖边界，在单个天线级别分析覆盖，然后聚合到站点级别，并扩展用于分析众包服务丢失报告。

Result: 该框架能准确绘制移动网络覆盖图，特别是在复杂城市环境中有效识别信号弱区。

Conclusion: 提出的基于众包数据和OC-SVM的框架为网络运营商提供了有效的覆盖分析和弱区识别工具。

Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise
identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators
striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

*He Du,Bowen Li,Chengxing Xie,Chang Gao,Kai Chen,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew)方法，这是一种无需训练的方法，利用模型对最终答案的token级置信度作为奖励信号，在数学推理任务中表现优异，甚至超越大多数训练过的奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励模型需要大量标注数据和昂贵的训练成本，而训练免费方法如LLM-as-a-Judge虽然有效，但使用置信度作为奖励的概念尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 提出CRew方法，利用模型对最终答案的token级置信度作为奖励代理；进一步提出CRew-DPO训练策略，从置信度得分结合正确性信号构建偏好数据。

Result: 在MATH500和RewardMATH基准测试中，CRew优于现有的训练免费奖励方法，甚至超越大多数训练过的奖励模型；CRew得分与模型实际推理性能强相关；CRew能有效筛选高质量训练数据。

Conclusion: CRew是一种简单而强大的训练免费奖励方法，CRew-DPO进一步提升了模型的判断能力，持续优于现有的自训练方法。

Abstract: Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and
costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as
LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate
responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that
model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing
between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using
confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we
systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful
training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final
answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks.
Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500
and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We
further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual
reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can
effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we
propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from
confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO
further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms
existing self-training methods.

Conclusion: 该风险评估框架有助于金融服务行业更好地采用生成式AI技术，解决性能评估中的关键挑战。

Abstract: As Generative Artificial Intelligence is adopted across the financial
services industry, a significant barrier to adoption and usage is measuring
model performance. Historical machine learning metrics can oftentimes fail to
generalize to GenAI workloads and are often supplemented using Subject Matter
Expert (SME) Evaluation. Even in this combination, many projects fail to
account for various unique risks present in choosing specific metrics.
Additionally, many widespread benchmarks created by foundational research labs
and educational institutions fail to generalize to industrial use. This paper
explains these challenges and provides a Risk Assessment Framework to allow for
better application of SME and machine learning Metrics

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为"串联训练"的强化学习方法，旨在使强语言模型产生对弱模型可理解的解决方案，通过随机将控制权交给弱模型来确保解决方案的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型的快速发展，其推理过程可能变得难以被较弱代理或人类理解，这会削弱可解释性和监督能力。因此需要开发方法使模型产生对较弱合作者保持可理解的解决方案。

Method: 提出了串联训练方法，在强化学习过程中随机从冻结的弱模型而非正在训练的强模型中采样令牌，只有当强模型的动作和推理过程能够被弱模型继续时，整个解决方案才能成功。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理任务中，串联训练可靠地教会模型放弃专业术语并适应较弱合作伙伴的语言，同时保持任务准确率。

Conclusion: 这种方法为构建对较弱代理保持可审计性的AI系统提供了一条有前景的途径，对人与AI协作和多智能体通信具有重要意义。

Abstract: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions
and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to
follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term
futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that
remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as
handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model
if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path
does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem
training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which
rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model
rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when
the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak
model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing
standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both
correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem
training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to
weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a
promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents,
with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

Abstract: Logic-based models can be used to build verification tools for machine

outcomes of new cases based on previous ones, thereby performing a form of
case-based reasoning (CBR). In this paper, we introduce a modal logic of
classifiers designed to formally capture legal CBR. We incorporate principles
for resolving conflicts between precedents, by introducing into the logic the
temporal dimension of cases and the hierarchy of courts within the legal
system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前构建辅助代理的方法往往鼓励代理独立完成任务而非真正协助人类实现目标，且需要昂贵的人工反馈。

Method: 通过最大化人类在环境中实现期望改变的能力（赋权）来调优语言模型，仅使用离线文本数据进行自监督微调。

Result: 用户研究中参与者78%更偏好Empower助手，接受率提高31%，建议减少38%；在模拟编程环境中，使用Empower训练的代理使模拟程序员在挑战性编程问题上的成功率平均提高192%。

Conclusion: Empower提供了一个仅使用离线数据、无需额外人工反馈的框架，用于构建大规模有用的对齐AI代理。

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or
verifiable rewards.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于控制理论的AI安全防护方法，将智能体AI安全视为序列决策问题，通过实时监控和主动修正来预防下游危害，而不是简单地阻止危险输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI安全防护主要依赖输出分类和人工指定标准，对新危险情况脆弱，且检测到不安全时通常只是拒绝行动，这并不总是安全选择。需要更动态的安全防护方法。

Method: 从安全关键控制理论视角形式化AI安全，在AI模型的世界表示中构建预测性防护栏，实时监控输出并主动修正危险输出为安全输出，采用模型无关方式，通过安全关键强化学习进行大规模训练。

Result: 在模拟驾驶和电子商务场景中的实验表明，控制理论防护栏能可靠地引导LLM智能体避免灾难性后果（从碰撞到破产），同时保持任务性能。

Conclusion: 控制理论防护栏为当前的标记-阻止式防护栏提供了原则性的动态替代方案，能够更有效地处理智能体AI系统的安全挑战。

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end
users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to
next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about
blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like
financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output
classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making
them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are
flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system
simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we
argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:
harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions
and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the
lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent
representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails
that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)
proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner
so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a
practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via
safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving
and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can
reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to
bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic
alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

Motivation: 在IMO 2025等需要严格步骤验证的数学推理任务中，需要强大的验证器来捕捉步骤级错误，但目前缺乏合适的评估基准。

Method: 构建了Hard2Verify基准，包含500+小时人工标注，评估29个生成式批评器和过程奖励模型在步骤验证任务上的表现。

Conclusion: 步骤级验证是数学推理的关键挑战，Hard2Verify为评估和改进验证器提供了重要基准，揭示了当前验证技术的局限性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.
