TL;DR: 研究表明，通过重新规划航线避开凝结尾迹形成区域，可以有效减少气候影响，但需要准确的天气预报稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决凝结尾迹导致的全球变暖问题，需要稳定的天气预报以支持航线调整策略。

Method: 比较ECMWF HRES天气预报和ERA5再分析数据生成的凝结尾迹预测，分析误差。

Result: 尽管点对点误差较高，但空间误差较小，优化航线可减少80-90%的凝结尾迹气候影响，燃料成本增加低于0.4%。

Conclusion: 长期天气预报稳定性足以支持凝结尾迹避让策略，有效减少气候影响。

Abstract: Mitigating contrail-induced warming by re-routing flights around
contrail-forming regions requires accurate and stable forecasts of the state of
the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Forecast stability (i.e.,
consistency between forecast cycles with different lead times) is particularly
important for "pre-tactical" contrail avoidance strategies that adjust routes
based on forecasts with lead times as long as 24-48 hours. However, no study to
date has systematically quantified the degree to which forecast stability
limits the effectiveness of pre-tactical avoidance. This study addresses this
gap by comparing contrail forecasts generated using ECMWF HRES weather
forecasts with lead times up to 48 hours to contrail hindcasts generated based
on ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. An analysis of forecast errors shows low pointwise
consistency between persistent-contrail-forming regions in forecasts and
reanalysis, with pointwise error rates similar to those found in previous
comparisons of contrail-forming regions in reanalysis and reality. However, we
also show that spatial errors in the locations of contrail-forming regions are
relatively small, both when forecasts are compared to reanalysis and when
reanalysis is compared to in-situ measurements. Finally, we show that designing
a trajectory optimizer to take advantage of relatively small spatial errors
allows flight trajectory optimizations based on contrail forecasts to reduce
contrail climate forcing evaluated based on reanalysis by 80-90% at the 8-24
hour lead times most relevant to flight planning, with fuel penalties under
0.4%. Our results show that forecasts with lead times relevant to flight
planning are stable enough to be used for pre-tactical contrail avoidance.

### [2] [Neural Architecture Search with Mixed Bio-inspired Learning Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13485)
*Imane Hamzaoui,Riyadh Baghdadi*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 通过自动搜索不同层的生物启发学习规则，结合神经架构搜索（NAS），提升了生物启发神经网络的准确性和可扩展性，甚至在某些情况下超越了基于反向传播的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物启发神经网络在对抗鲁棒性、能效和生理对齐方面具有优势，但在准确性和可扩展性上落后于基于反向传播的模型。研究旨在通过混合不同学习规则来弥补这一差距。

Method: 扩展NAS搜索空间，自动发现并应用不同层的生物启发学习规则，优化网络架构和每层的学习规则。

Result: 混合学习规则的网络在多个数据集上创下新纪录（如CIFAR-10 95.16%），部分情况下超越反向传播模型，同时保持鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: 层间学习规则的多样性提升了生物启发网络的性能，为混合多学习规则的进一步研究提供了动力。

Abstract: Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness,
energy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often
lag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale.
We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in
different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored
neural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from
standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired
learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to
use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired
learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a
single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of
bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on
CIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on
ImageNet. In some regimes, they even surpass comparable BP-based networks while
retaining their robustness advantages. Our results suggest that layer-wise
diversity in learning rules allows better scalability and accuracy, and
motivates further research on mixing multiple bio-inspired learning rules in
the same network.

Abstract: This paper investigates the development of high-performance racing
controllers for a newly implemented racing mode within the Xpilot-AI platform,
utilizing the Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. By
leveraging NEAT's capability to evolve both the structure and weights of neural
networks, we develop adaptive controllers that can navigate complex circuits
under the challenging space simulation physics of Xpilot-AI, which includes
elements such as inertia, friction, and gravity. The racing mode we introduce
supports flexible circuit designs and allows for the evaluation of multiple
agents in parallel, enabling efficient controller optimization across
generations. Experimental results demonstrate that our evolved controllers
achieve up to 32% improvement in lap time compared to the controller's initial
performance and develop effective racing strategies, such as optimal cornering
and speed modulation, comparable to human-like techniques. This work
illustrates NEAT's effectiveness in producing robust control strategies within
demanding game environments and highlights Xpilot-AI's potential as a rigorous
testbed for competitive AI controller evolution.

### [4] [MorphoNAS: Embryogenic Neural Architecture Search Through Morphogen-Guided Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13785)
*Mykola Glybovets,Sergii Medvid*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: MorphoNAS是一种受生物学启发的神经架构搜索方法，通过简单的基因组和局部化学相互作用，从单个祖细胞自组织生成复杂神经网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人工神经架构搜索方法依赖大量手动工作，而生物神经网络通过简单规则从紧凑基因组发展。MorphoNAS旨在模拟这一自然过程。

Method: MorphoNAS利用形态发生自组织，基于自由能原理、反应扩散系统和基因调控网络，通过简单基因组编码形态动力学和细胞发育规则。

Result: 在结构目标和功能性能任务中，MorphoNAS成功生成预定义随机图配置（8-31节点）和低复杂度（6-7神经元）解决方案。

Conclusion: MorphoNAS表明，通过简单发育规则可以生成复杂神经架构，为高效神经架构搜索提供了可行的生物学途径。

Abstract: While biological neural networks develop from compact genomes using
relatively simple rules, modern artificial neural architecture search methods
mostly involve explicit and routine manual work. In this paper, we introduce
MorphoNAS (Morphogenetic Neural Architecture Search), a system able to
deterministically grow neural networks through morphogenetic self-organization
inspired by the Free Energy Principle, reaction-diffusion systems, and gene
regulatory networks. In MorphoNAS, simple genomes encode just morphogens
dynamics and threshold-based rules of cellular development. Nevertheless, this
leads to self-organization of a single progenitor cell into complex neural
networks, while the entire process is built on local chemical interactions. Our
evolutionary experiments focused on two different domains: structural
targeting, in which MorphoNAS system was able to find fully successful genomes
able to generate predefined random graph configurations (8-31 nodes); and
functional performance on the CartPole control task achieving low complexity
6-7 neuron solutions when target network size minimization evolutionary
pressure was applied. The evolutionary process successfully balanced between
quality of of the final solutions and neural architecture search effectiveness.
Overall, our findings suggest that the proposed MorphoNAS method is able to
grow complex specific neural architectures, using simple developmental rules,
which suggests a feasible biological route to adaptive and efficient neural
architecture search.

### [5] [Conceptual and Design Principles for a Self-Referential Algorithm Mimicking Neuronal Assembly Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14011)
*Paolo Totaro,Alberto Mangiante*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于经验的形式化认知过程模型方法，从生命系统的视角而非观察者视角出发，利用环境生成算子（EGO）和自指语言（E-language）模拟认知过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从生命系统的视角形式化认知过程模型，强调系统维持生命平衡的需求。

Method: 使用环境生成算子（EGO）和自指语言（E-language）模拟Hebb理解的神经元集合操作。

Result: 已实现并测试了EGO原型（EGO-P）。

Conclusion: 该方法为从生命系统视角研究认知过程提供了新工具。

Abstract: This article proposes a method to formalise models of cognitive processes
grounded in experience, considering experience from the perspective of a living
system and not from that of an observer of the living system. The perspective
of a living system is defined by the need of the system to preserve the vital
equilibria. The method is based on an algorithmic schema that we call
Environment Generative Operator (EGO) and uses a self-referential language
developed for this purpose which we call E-language. EGO simulates cognitive
processes as operations on neuron assemblies as understood by Hebb. In this
article we present an EGO prototype (EGO-P) which has already been implemented
and tested.

TL;DR: 本文综述了无人机航拍场景中的开放词汇目标检测（OVOD），探讨了其核心原理、现有方法分类、数据集及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无人机目标检测方法局限于预定义类别，而OVOD通过跨模态文本-图像对齐技术（如CLIP）实现了对未见物体的检测，提升了无人机在航拍场景中的智能性和自主性。

Method: 通过系统分类现有OVOD方法，并结合无人机视觉特性，构建了一个全面的综述框架，包括数据集分析和挑战讨论。

Result: 提出了无人机航拍场景中OVOD的关键挑战和开放问题，并总结了现有方法的优缺点。

Conclusion: 本文为研究者提供了清晰的路线图和参考，推动了这一快速发展领域的创新。

Abstract: Due to its extensive applications, aerial image object detection has long
been a hot topic in computer vision. In recent years, advancements in Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new
heights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,
traditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting
predefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The
advent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this
limitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can
identify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This
breakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in
aerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD
in the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles
of OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a
specialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic
taxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides
a comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review
enables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the
intersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline
promising future research directions and application prospects. This survey
aims to provide a clear road map and a valuable reference for both newcomers
and seasoned researchers, fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDNIG是一种基于U-Net架构的深度学习框架，用于低光图像增强，通过亮度引导和SPP模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像增强问题，通过亮度引导和GAN框架优化模型。

Method: 结合U-Net、亮度图（BCP）、SPP模块和Swish激活函数，使用GAN框架和复合损失函数训练。

Result: 在定量指标和视觉质量上优于现有方法，模型复杂度较低。

Conclusion: EDNIG适合实际应用，性能优越且高效。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for low-light image
enhancement, named the Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination Guidance
(EDNIG). Building upon the U-Net architecture, EDNIG integrates an illumination
map, derived from Bright Channel Prior (BCP), as a guidance input. This
illumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions,
effectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's
representational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated
to extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse
lighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to
ensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss
function that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE),
and perceptual loss. Experimental results show that EDNIG achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and
visual quality, while maintaining lower model complexity, demonstrating its
suitability for real-world applications. The source code for this work is

### [8] [VLMs have Tunnel Vision: Evaluating Nonlocal Visual Reasoning in Leading VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13361)
*Shmuel Berman,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs在复杂视觉任务中表现出色，但在简单感知测试中表现不佳。研究发现，当前模型缺乏非局部视觉推理能力，如比较感知、扫视搜索和连续视觉搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视觉语言模型在非局部视觉推理任务中的表现，揭示其核心视觉推理能力的不足。

Method: 设计三种非局部视觉任务（比较感知、扫视搜索、连续视觉搜索），测试主流模型的表现。

Result: 主流模型在这些任务中表现不佳，甚至低于人类随机准确率。

Conclusion: 尽管视觉能力有所提升，当前VLMs仍缺乏核心视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and
chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple
perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models'
capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining
evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We
isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which
demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic
search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate
successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly
along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude
Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior
primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy
on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured
evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual
algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual
acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLM）的空间推理能力，通过链式思维（CoT）提示和强化学习优化性能。发现结构化多阶段提示（SceneGraph CoT）显著提升准确性，而强化学习方法GRPO在泛化性和鲁棒性上优于监督微调（SFT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过提示策略和强化学习提升VLM的空间推理能力，并解决传统方法（如SFT）在泛化和鲁棒性上的不足。

Method: 采用链式思维（CoT）提示策略和强化学习方法（GRPO），在SAT数据集上微调模型，并在CVBench上评估性能。

Result: SceneGraph CoT显著提升空间推理准确性；GRPO在Pass@1评估和OOD条件下表现优于SFT，泛化性更强。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和强化学习能有效提升VLM的空间推理能力和泛化性，为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement
learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies
and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step
before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's
original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on
scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune
models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and
evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates
superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,
we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade
performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther
from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable
performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how
reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用2D视觉语言模型进行开放词汇3D物体检测，无需人工标注3D标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D物体检测数据集类别有限且标注成本高，而2D视觉语言模型具有丰富的语义理解和开放词汇能力。

Method: 通过2D视觉语言检测器生成文本条件提案，结合SAM分割和相机几何投影到3D空间，使用DBSCAN聚类和Rotating Calipers推断3D边界框。

Result: 在LiDAR和RGB-D输入下实现竞争性定位性能，且无需训练。

Conclusion: 展示了2D基础模型在可扩展3D感知中的潜力。

Abstract: Modern 3D object detection datasets are constrained by narrow class
taxonomies and costly manual annotations, limiting their ability to scale to
open-world settings. In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on
web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support
open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we
leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform
open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels.
  Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned
proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera
geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric
inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D
bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we
construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes
dataset.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization
performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D
inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary. Our results
highlight the untapped potential of 2D foundation models for scalable 3D
perception. We open-source our code and resources at

Conclusion: 所提出的架构、预训练策略和多任务训练方法在多模态任务中表现优异。

Abstract: We present a novel multimodal multitask network and associated training
algorithm. The method is capable of ingesting data from approximately 12
different modalities namely image, video, audio, text, depth, point cloud, time
series, tabular, graph, X-ray, infrared, IMU, and hyperspectral. The proposed
approach utilizes modality specialized tokenizers, a shared transformer
architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms to project the data from different
modalities into a unified embedding space. It addresses multimodal and
multitask scenarios by incorporating modality-specific task heads for different
tasks in respective modalities. We propose a novel pretraining strategy with
iterative modality switching to initialize the network, and a training
algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with
training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation
across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining
strategy and adapted multitask training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有架构（如YOLO和DETR）在多尺度特征一致性和计算效率之间难以平衡，影响了自动驾驶场景中的目标检测性能。

Method: Butter引入FAFCE组件（频率自适应特征一致性增强）和PHFFNet模块（渐进式层次特征融合网络），优化多尺度特征一致性和语义融合。

Result: 在BDD100K、KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上，Butter表现出卓越的特征表示能力，检测精度显著提升，同时降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: Butter通过层次特征优化与融合，在自动驾驶实时场景中实现了精度、可部署性和计算效率的平衡。

Abstract: Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision,
particularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic
understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and
traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as
YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales
while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address
these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework
designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving
detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:
Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which
refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency
filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive
Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively
integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen
hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,
and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation
capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while
reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and
integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that
achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational
efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and
implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter,
facilitating further research and validation within the autonomous driving

TL;DR: ModaRoute是一个基于LLM的多模态视频检索路由系统，通过动态选择最优模态，减少计算开销并保持检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集文本标注方法计算成本高且会遗漏关键视觉信息，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用GPT-4.1分析查询意图，动态选择ASR、OCR和视觉索引中的模态，减少搜索范围。

Result: 计算开销降低41%，Recall@5达到60.9%，平均每查询使用1.78种模态。

Conclusion: 智能路由为多模态检索系统提供了可扩展的实用解决方案，降低了成本并保持了竞争力。

Abstract: We introduce ModaRoute, an LLM-based intelligent routing system that
dynamically selects optimal modalities for multimodal video retrieval. While
dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline
processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with
scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting
information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while
achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR
(speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query
versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips
demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling
multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining
competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Industrial defect detection is vital for upholding product quality across
contemporary manufacturing systems. As the expectations for precision,
automation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are
increasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress
in computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect
detection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant
development has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection
frameworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and
facilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a
cohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains
elusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both
closed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D
modalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the
rising prominence of open-set techniques. We distill critical challenges
inherent in practical detection environments and illuminate emerging trends,
thereby providing a current and comprehensive vista of this swiftly progressing
field.

### [17] [Using Multiple Input Modalities Can Improve Data-Efficiency and O.O.D. Generalization for ML with Satellite Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13385)
*Arjun Rao,Esther Rolf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了在卫星图像机器学习（SatML）任务中，融合其他地理数据层与光学图像的效果，发现多模态输入能显著提升模型性能，尤其在数据有限和地理样本外场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SatML模型主要针对光学输入模态设计，而其他地理数据层的潜在价值未被充分探索。

Method: 通过为SatML基准任务生成增强版本，将额外地理数据层与光学图像结合，评估分类、回归和分割任务中的性能提升。

Result: 多模态输入显著提升模型性能，尤其在数据有限和样本外场景中；硬编码融合策略优于学习策略。

Conclusion: 多模态输入对SatML模型的数据效率和样本外性能具有重要价值，未来研究可关注融合策略的优化。

Abstract: A large variety of geospatial data layers is available around the world
ranging from remotely-sensed raster data like satellite imagery, digital
elevation models, predicted land cover maps, and human-annotated data, to data
derived from environmental sensors such as air temperature or wind speed data.
A large majority of machine learning models trained on satellite imagery
(SatML), however, are designed primarily for optical input modalities such as
multi-spectral satellite imagery. To better understand the value of using other
input modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we
generate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional
geographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and
segmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional
geographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model
performance. Benefits are largest in settings where labeled data are limited
and in geographic out-of-sample settings, suggesting that multi-modal inputs
may be especially valuable for data-efficiency and out-of-sample performance of
SatML models. Surprisingly, we find that hard-coded fusion strategies
outperform learned variants, with interesting implications for future work.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in producing high-quality images, but their reliance on
large-scale unlabeled data has raised significant safety and copyright
concerns. Efforts to address these issues by erasing unwanted concepts have
shown promise. However, many existing erasure methods involve excessive
modifications that compromise the overall utility of the model. In this work,
we address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure
objective based \emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation
outputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for
differentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all
generation steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to
show theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the
robustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to
model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching
models demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading
overall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible
generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D语义占用预测需要昂贵的LiDAR标注数据，而二进制占用数据成本较低但未被充分利用。研究探索了如何利用二进制数据提升预测效果。

Method: 提出了一种框架，将预测过程分解为二进制和语义占用模块，利用二进制数据进行预训练和学习型自动标注。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在预训练和自动标注任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了3D语义占用预测的性能，且代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe
autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D
structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important
for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR
sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is
assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making
data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which
only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected
at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such
data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of
large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and
(2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based
framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic
occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型InSyn，通过显式捕捉多样化的行人交互模式（如同步行走或冲突行为）和方向敏感的社交行为，显著提升了行人轨迹预测的准确性。同时，引入SSOS训练策略以减少初始步预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖相对位置建模行人交互，但忽略了特定交互模式（如配对行走或冲突行为），导致在拥挤场景中预测准确性受限。

Method: 提出InSyn模型，基于Transformer显式捕捉多样化交互模式，并引入SSOS训练策略以解决时间序列预测中的初始步发散问题。

Result: 在ETH和UCY数据集上，InSyn显著优于基线模型，尤其是在高密度场景中。SSOS策略将初始步预测误差降低了约6.58%。

Conclusion: InSyn通过显式建模交互模式和方向敏感行为，结合SSOS策略，有效提升了行人轨迹预测的准确性，尤其在复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent
applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on
relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to
overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting
behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address
this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel
Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns
(e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling
direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training
strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue
of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on
the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent
baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the
SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance,
reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.

Result: MADI显著提升了扩散模型的可编辑性和组合性。

Conclusion: MADI为扩散模型在通用上下文生成架构中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image
generation, their effectiveness in grounded visual editing and compositional
control remains challenging. Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning
and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful
design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for
structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented
Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the
editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through
two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion
(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines
standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy
input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative
and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and
structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity
scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders
inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference
time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during
training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these
contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion
models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose,
in-context generative diffusion architectures.

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive public dataset for driver
drowsiness detection, integrating multimodal signals of facial, behavioral, and
biometric indicators. Our dataset includes 3D facial video using a depth
camera, IR camera footage, posterior videos, and biometric signals such as
heart rate, electrodermal activity, blood oxygen saturation, skin temperature,
and accelerometer data. This data set provides grip sensor data from the
steering wheel and telemetry data from the American truck simulator game to
provide more information about drivers' behavior while they are alert and
drowsy. Drowsiness levels were self-reported every four minutes using the
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The simulation environment consists of three
monitor setups, and the driving condition is completely like a car. Data were
collected from 19 subjects (15 M, 4 F) in two conditions: when they were fully
alert and when they exhibited signs of sleepiness. Unlike other datasets, our
multimodal dataset has a continuous duration of 40 minutes for each data
collection session per subject, contributing to a total length of 1,400
minutes, and we recorded gradual changes in the driver state rather than
discrete alert/drowsy labels. This study aims to create a comprehensive
multimodal dataset of driver drowsiness that captures a wider range of
physiological, behavioral, and driving-related signals. The dataset will be
available upon request to the corresponding author.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的3D主动脉构建对临床诊断和CFD模拟至关重要，但现有方法依赖大数据集和手动干预，生成的网格几何一致性差。

Method: AortaDiff采用体积引导的条件扩散模型生成主动脉中心线，并自动提取血管轮廓，最终拟合为平滑3D表面。

Result: 实验表明，AortaDiff在有限训练数据下仍能有效构建正常和病理主动脉网格，几何保真度高。

Conclusion: AortaDiff为心血管研究提供了一种端到端、低依赖大数据集的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis,
preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as
it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow
velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction
methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual
intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,
they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces
suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce
AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces
directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided
conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines
conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then
automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,
ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are
fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh
representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,
including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,
and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric
fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively
even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and
pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or
coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality
visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for
cardiovascular research.

Motivation: 现有评测基准很少测试模型在视觉蕴含任务上的能力，特别是在拥挤场景中。

Method: 提出COREVQA基准，包含5608张图像和合成的真假陈述对，基于CrowdHuman数据集。

Result: 表现最佳的模型准确率低于80%，其他模型表现更差（39.98%-69.95%）。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在拥挤场景的视觉蕴含推理能力存在明显局限。

Abstract: Recently, many benchmarks and datasets have been developed to evaluate
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using visual question answering (VQA) pairs, and
models have shown significant accuracy improvements. However, these benchmarks
rarely test the model's ability to accurately complete visual entailment, for
instance, accepting or refuting a hypothesis based on the image. To address
this, we propose COREVQA (Crowd Observations and Reasoning Entailment), a
benchmark of 5608 image and synthetically generated true/false statement pairs,
with images derived from the CrowdHuman dataset, to provoke visual entailment
reasoning on challenging crowded images. Our results show that even the
top-performing VLMs achieve accuracy below 80%, with other models performing
substantially worse (39.98%-69.95%). This significant performance gap reveals
key limitations in VLMs' ability to reason over certain types of image-question
pairs in crowded scenes.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing
AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against
misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking
techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their
effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel
in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable
concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable
watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or
perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic
attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to
adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image
augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of
watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,
demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining
image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking
techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce
IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with
StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against
multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique
(IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9%
higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on
various datasets.

Method: 开发了基于10,000张标注肩部X光片的多模型深度学习系统，采用Faster R-CNN、EfficientDet和RF-DETR架构，并结合多种融合技术（如Soft-NMS、WBF和NMW）。

Result: NMW融合技术实现了95.5%的准确率和0.9610的F1分数，优于单个模型，表现出高召回率和定位精度。

Conclusion: 基于融合的AI系统能可靠检测肩部骨折，适合实时诊断流程，但仅限于二元骨折检测，适用于快速筛查而非详细分类。

Abstract: Background: Shoulder fractures are often underdiagnosed, especially in
emergency and high-volume clinical settings. Studies report up to 10% of such
fractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way
to assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap
through a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a
multi-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.
Architectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and
RF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level
ensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW
ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming
individual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and
localization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture
detection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI
can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical
relevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for
integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited
to binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and
triage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.

Result: 检测精度显著提升（IoU>85%，准确率90%），并发现四个新遗址。

Conclusion: AI结合历史影像可有效发现已消失的考古遗址，为考古学提供新工具。

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by
one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we
improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of
archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in
the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same
sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using
CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad,
central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising.
First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased
sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image
segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in
detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model
allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest
(confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by
archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of
using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover
archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with
significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing
archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

Motivation: 当前方法难以准确建模复杂时空依赖和人类驾驶行为的不可预测性，需改进以提升人机共驾系统的安全性和交互效率。

Method: 提出CaSTFormer，包含互易移位融合（RSF）机制、因果模式提取（CPE）模块和特征合成网络（FSN），用于精确建模因果关系。

Result: 在Brain4Cars数据集上实现最优性能，有效捕捉复杂时空依赖。

Conclusion: CaSTFormer显著提升了驾驶意图预测的准确性和透明度，为高级自动驾驶奠定基础。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving intention is key to enhancing the safety and
interactive efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems. It serves as a
cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current
approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex
spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human
driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal
Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between
driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction.
Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF)
mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature
streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically
eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and
an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these
purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate
the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal
spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of
driving intention prediction.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating
high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately
simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This
paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The
benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from
fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more
complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion.
Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts
intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether
models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency.
Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective
method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a
zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation
models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed
comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering
to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050
curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we
identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world
physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical
phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for
crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

Motivation: 摄影测量点云的精度高度依赖场景，且MVS阶段的不确定性估计尚未标准化，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出自校准方法，利用MVS阶段的可靠多视点回归视差不确定性，结合匹配成本值等线索。

Result: 在多种公开数据集上验证，方法优于现有方法，实现了高边界率且未高估不确定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为摄影测量过程提供了稳健且可验证的不确定性量化，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for
providing per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne
LiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the
accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it
relies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).
Generally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a
two-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),
followed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM
stage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the
reprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and
non-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal
nature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an
uncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error
covariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry
process. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose
a novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)
per-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such
as matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,
our method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the
MVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering
to error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a
robust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We
evaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV
imagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.

Abstract: Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) data has proven effective for agricultural

TL;DR: SparseC-AFM是一种深度学习模型，用于快速重建二维材料的电导率图，显著减少数据采集时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统C-AFM技术因扫描速度慢而无法满足大规模生产需求的问题。

Result: SparseC-AFM将采集时间减少11倍以上，且预测结果与高分辨率数据相似。

Conclusion: 该技术为AI辅助二维材料表征从实验室研究向工业制造的转化迈出重要一步。

Abstract: The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics
demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially
for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like
conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data
acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we
introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately
reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM
scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and
experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow
implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to
collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)
our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that
requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in
MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of
crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction
in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM
image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit
remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using
classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward
translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research
to industrial fabrication. Code and model weights are available at

Abstract: We propose a novel formulation for the second-order total generalized

function, taking values on the unit sphere. Our formulation extends previous
discrete TGV models for piecewise constant scalar data that utilize a
Raviart-Thomas function space. To exctend this formulation to the manifold
setting, a tailor-made tangential Raviart-Thomas type finite element space is
constructed in this work. The new regularizer is compared to existing methods
in mesh denoising experiments.

Conclusion: NABLA在高效视频生成中具有显著优势，且易于集成。

Abstract: Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated
remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity
of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for
high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose
NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that
dynamically adapts to sparsity patterns in video diffusion transformers (DiTs).
By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold,
NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our
method does not require custom low-level operator design and can be seamlessly
integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that
NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline
almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score,
human evaluation score) and visual quality drop. The code and model weights are

Motivation: 现有合成重放方法生成的样本可能因未捕捉领域细微差异和细粒度语义而误导微调，削弱先验知识保留。

Method: 采用LoRA增强的合成重放框架，分两阶段基于置信度选择样本：先选择代表性真实任务数据微调LoRA，再生成并筛选高置信度合成样本用于蒸馏。

Result: 在MTIL基准测试中表现优于现有合成重放技术，实现了塑性、稳定性和零样本能力的平衡。

Conclusion: 通过LoRA适配生成器，显著提升了视觉语言模型在持续学习中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable
performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable
Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,
real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and
fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay
methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine
retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced
synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a
frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique
visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,
confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by
post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most
representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them
by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay
fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning
(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay
techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and
zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator
adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

Conclusion: NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF方法有效解决了噪声点云下的表面重建问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate implicit surface representations from point clouds
remains a challenging task, particularly when data is captured using
low-quality scanning devices. These point clouds often contain substantial
noise, leading to inaccurate surface reconstructions. Inspired by the
Noise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel
method designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach
enables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through
noisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations,
allowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We
evaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the
ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework significantly improves surface reconstruction quality from noisy
inputs.

Method: 提出扩散模型框架，结合纹理先验编码器（TPE）和纹理转移变换器层（TTformer），利用自适应滤波去除空间变化模糊。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为非监督去模糊提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is
difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is
a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches
rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to
sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based
framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying
texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate
the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To
implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a
memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for
DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the
Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel
Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes
spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we
implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture
details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising
unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性训练方法生成的SR图像模糊且感知质量差，因此作者希望通过扩散模型生成清晰且高保真的SR图像。

Method: 使用随机采样器结合高阶ODE以及通过知识蒸馏实现一步扩散，提高了扩散模型的效率。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法将运行时间减少至基线的1.6%，同时保持了基于图像失真和感知质量的SR质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著提升效率的同时，成功生成了高质量的SR图像。

Abstract: While burst Low-Resolution (LR) images are useful for improving their Super
Resolution (SR) image compared to a single LR image, prior burst SR methods are
trained in a deterministic manner, which produces a blurry SR image. Since such
blurry images are perceptually degraded, we aim to reconstruct sharp and
high-fidelity SR images by a diffusion model. Our method improves the
efficiency of the diffusion model with a stochastic sampler with a high-order
ODE as well as one-step diffusion using knowledge distillation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the runtime to 1.6
% of its baseline while maintaining the SR quality measured based on image
distortion and perceptual quality.

Method: 提出CoTasks框架，将复杂视频问题分解为帧定位、实体跟踪、时空关系提取等四个基础任务，嵌入中间推理步骤。

Result: 在NeXT-QA基准测试中，LLaVA-video-7B和Qwen2.5-VL-3B分别提升3.3和17.4分，因果、时序和描述性子类别表现显著提升。

Conclusion: CoTasks作为一种结构化监督框架，有效提升了视频组合推理能力。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key
open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding.
Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are
trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations
necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks:
Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that
decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR)
into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking,
spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate
CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly
perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA
benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance:
LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal
(+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for
improving compositional video reasoning.

Motivation: 从移动相机视角分离动态和静态物体对3D重建、自主导航和场景理解至关重要，现有方法依赖光流但效果有限。

Method: FoELS通过计算扩展焦点（FoE）并融合光流异常值和分割先验，估计动态概率。

Result: 在DAVIS 2016数据集和真实交通视频中表现优异，达到先进水平。

Conclusion: FoELS能有效处理复杂场景、旋转相机运动和平行运动，性能优越。

Abstract: Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is
essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding
in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which
struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving
camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion
Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of
integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus
of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood
from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a
segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method
effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational
camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016
dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有混合表示方法（NeRF+SMPL）因变形方案计算成本高导致推理速度慢，而EPSilon通过优化采样策略解决了这一问题。

Method: 提出两种空点采样策略：空射线忽略（ERO）和空区间忽略（EIO），以减少无效采样点，提升训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: EPSilon通过高效采样策略显著提升了混合表示方法的性能，为3D人体化身生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to
generate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole
usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of
hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF
representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar
generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their
deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the
deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational
costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points
are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but
result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we
propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel
efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In
EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray
omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that
progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval
on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.
The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational
cost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important
regions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without
hierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the
generation quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around
20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person
re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance
in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted
significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms
primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving
privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are
typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera
datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance
and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper
introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.
The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,
with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.
We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid
foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on
our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian
attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for
person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only
effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event
streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic
features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully
validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.

Result: 在TUMTraf-V2X数据集上，HeCoFuse在LC+LC配置下达到43.22% 3D mAP，L+LC配置下达到43.38% 3D mAP，性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HeCoFuse在异构传感器配置下表现出色，成为TUM-Traf V2X数据集上的最新技术，并在CVPR 2025 DriveX挑战中取得第一名。

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often
operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and
deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity
poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To
address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for
cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras
(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that
adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial
attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality
feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an
adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance
computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across
different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments
on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%
3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D
baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC
scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine
heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our
first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the
current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust
performance across diverse sensor deployments.

Result: 在多种图像恢复任务中，PW-FNet在质量和效率上均优于现有方法，参数和计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: PW-FNet为图像恢复提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案，适用于实际部署场景。

Abstract: Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions,
significantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration
has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed
in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made
remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity
poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in
real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to
simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or
state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network
architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration
itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative
pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image
restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient
restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).
Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block
level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to
achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the
intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative
to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity
while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks
such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion
deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light
enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with
significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.

limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn
new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a
text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that
FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting
from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale
representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To
maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple
complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight
support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our
framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal
trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.
Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that
Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on
previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaskHOI框架，通过MAE预训练和区域特定掩码分配，提升3D手-物交互任务的姿态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目RGB输入中几何模糊和交互遮挡问题。

Method: 采用MAE驱动的预训练框架，引入区域特定掩码分配和骨架驱动掩码引导，结合掩码SDF多模态学习。

Result: 实验表明方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MaskHOI通过几何感知和遮挡鲁棒性学习，有效提升了姿态估计性能。

Abstract: In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of
hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to
the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions
that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,
a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI
pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction
strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and
structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and
occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our
observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than
rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the
reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the
region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking
guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions
than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the
latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire
fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world
interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained
encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven
multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the
learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and
objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of
monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以准确捕捉HSI的高频细节，需改进重建效果。

Method: 通过扩散模型隐式学习SDP，并结合SPIM动态指导模型恢复HSI细节。

Result: 在MST和BISRNet上实验，性能提升约0.5 dB。

Conclusion: SDP和SPIM有效提升了HSI重建的细节恢复能力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its
degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep
learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately
capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from
hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability
of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can
significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To
further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the
Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover
the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST
and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing
networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI
reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 磁共振血流成像的低时空分辨率和信噪比限制了其诊断价值，需要一种更精确的方法来预测动脉瘤破裂和指导治疗。

Method: LoFNO结合拉普拉斯特征向量作为几何先验，增强对不规则几何结构的感知，并采用EDSR层进行稳健的上采样。

Result: LoFNO在去噪和时空上采样方面表现优于插值和其他深度学习方法，实现了更精确的流速和WSS预测。

Conclusion: LoFNO为脑血管诊断提供了更精确的工具，有望改善动脉瘤破裂预测和治疗指导。

Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding
treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved
volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose
the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that
enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall
shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates
Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on
irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with
neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow
data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation
and alternative deep learning methods, enabling more precise cerebrovascular
diagnostics.

Motivation: 结构健康监测需求增长，需要高精度运动测量技术。现有视觉方法在亚像素级测量中精度不足或参数调整复杂。

Method: 开发了一种基于高斯核的运动测量方法，通过跟踪高斯核位置提取帧间运动，引入运动一致性和超分辨率约束提高精度和鲁棒性。

Result: 数值和实验验证表明，该方法无需定制参数即可实现高精度测量。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构健康监测提供了一种高精度、无需复杂参数调整的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for structural health monitoring has driven increasing
interest in high-precision motion measurement, as structural information
derived from extracted motions can effectively reflect the current condition of
the structure. Among various motion measurement techniques, vision-based
methods stand out due to their low cost, easy installation, and large-scale
measurement. However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement,
current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require
extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and
filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed
a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the
motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels.
The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a
super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness
of our method. Numerical and experimental validations show that it can
consistently reach high accuracy without customized parameter setup for
different test samples.

Conclusion: CF-SSC通过时空建模显著提升了3D语义场景补全的性能，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a
critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer
complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in
real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains
occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that
existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC
framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's
effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish
accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,
present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more
robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our
approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and
3D scene completion accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GOSPA和T-GOSPA度量在评估MOT算法时缺乏灵活性，无法对不同错误类型（如误检和漏检）施加不同惩罚。

Method: 提出两种准度量：一种扩展GOSPA度量用于目标集差异，另一种扩展T-GOSPA度量用于轨迹集差异，支持非对称定位成本和不同错误惩罚。

Result: 通过仿真实验，使用T-GOSPA准度量评估了多种贝叶斯MOT算法的性能。

Conclusion: 新准度量在MOT评估中更具灵活性，适用于特定应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of
multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an
extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and
measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an
extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy
between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these
quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected
objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The
T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the
GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of
penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation
costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT
evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT
algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for open-ended video question answering that
enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as
benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models
(Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal
modeling, and poor generalization to ambiguous or compositional queries. To
address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration
mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs)
via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways.
An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator,
selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across
all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our
approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal
reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for
future Video-LMM development.

Result: 通过人类和定量评估验证了方法的有效性，生成图像能更好地捕捉诗歌信息。

Conclusion: PoemTale Diffusion为诗歌到图像生成提供了新视角，并促进了相关研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A
critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret
textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative
expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly
descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach
tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:
poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.
Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that
is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage
prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of
poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion
models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent
self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then
collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research
in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting
of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a
panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both
human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and
contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced
information capture in the generated images.

Motivation: 解决VLMs在处理内部知识与外部信息冲突时产生的幻觉和不可靠响应问题，探索其机制。

Method: 引入多模态反事实查询数据集，使用logit检查定位控制冲突的头部，并通过修改这些头部来引导模型。

Result: 发现一小部分头部控制冲突，修改这些头部可以引导模型偏向内部知识或视觉输入；注意力机制优于基于梯度的归因方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs处理知识冲突的机制，为改进模型可靠性提供了方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources
to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal
parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result
in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such
interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms
that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of
multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal
commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads
that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the
model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show
that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual
overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.

enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart
markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including
a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a
YOLOv7-based network extended with a distance estimation module. Experimental
results on a dataset of real-world maritime scenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves object localization and association accuracy in

Conclusion: StyleGAN的技术细节揭示了其强大的生成能力，但也凸显了被滥用于伪造身份等伦理风险。

Abstract: In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are
increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based
generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of
producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of
how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of
StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such
as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the
model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,
enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is
revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without
drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational
requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily
influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global
alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while
targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of
specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of
academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential
misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to
fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context
of digital deception and cybercrime.

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose
systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In
this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's
perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time
horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including
those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw
pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible
by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision
backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the
frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,
task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we
introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties
directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine
models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging
representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video
understanding.

Conclusion: CSD-VAR为内容-风格分解任务提供了高效解决方案，并展示了VAR框架的潜力。

Abstract: Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style
decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and
stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in
visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the
decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion
models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a
promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving
performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore
VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation
process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel
method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating
optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their
respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method
to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented
Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark
this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for
content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various
artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior
approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

Conclusion: EVS通过结合T2I和T2V模型的优势，显著提升了视频生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered
considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual
descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion
representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing
approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video
frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to
inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free
Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both
visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach
utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video
frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing
them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to
ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior
into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of
both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion
quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a
significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:

TL;DR: VLA-Mark是一种视觉对齐的水印框架，通过跨模态协调嵌入可检测水印，同时保持语义保真度，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本水印方法破坏了视觉-文本对齐，VLA-Mark旨在保护知识产权且不影响多模态连贯性。

Method: 结合多尺度视觉-文本对齐指标（局部补丁亲和性、全局语义连贯性和上下文注意力模式），动态平衡水印强度与语义保留。

Result: 实验显示，VLA-Mark在PPL和BLEU上优于传统方法，检测准确率高达98.8%，抗攻击能力强（96.1%）。

Conclusion: VLA-Mark为质量保持的多模态水印设定了新标准。

Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect
intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text
watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token
selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable.
We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable
watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination.
Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining
localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention
patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An
entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and
semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty
generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than
conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework
demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and
synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing
new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

TL;DR: 论文评估了一种基于深度学习的自动化软件（Carebot AI Bones）用于测量脊柱侧弯的Cobb角，结果显示其与放射科医生的测量结果高度一致，可用于临床工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱侧弯影响2-4%的青少年，传统手动测量耗时且存在观察者间差异。研究旨在验证自动化软件的准确性和实用性。

Method: 研究采用回顾性多中心评估，对103张脊柱X光片使用AI软件测量Cobb角，并与两位放射科医生的独立测量结果进行对比。

Result: AI与放射科医生的测量结果高度相关（Pearson r=0.906/0.880），平均绝对误差（MAE）约为3.9度，Cohen kappa显示严重程度分类一致性中等。

Conclusion: AI软件能够复现专家水平的Cobb角测量和分类，有望优化脊柱侧弯的临床报告和分诊流程。

Abstract: Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment
decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time
consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a
retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning
software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on
103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten
hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study
and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist
was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four
grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of
3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of
agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI
achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees
and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r
equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen
kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59).
These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level
Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres,
suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in
clinical workflows.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于排列熵（PE）的新型特征提取方法，结合HOG和LBP，用于图像分类，展示了轻量级且可解释的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索在图像分类中，如何在保持计算效率和可解释性的同时，避免使用参数庞大的深度学习模型。

Method: 方法包括将PE扩展到二维图像，结合HOG和LBP提取特征，并使用SVM分类器进行优化和评估。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，该方法表现出色，证明了其作为深度学习替代方案的潜力。

Conclusion: 结论表明，基于熵的特征与经典描述符结合，提供了一种轻量级、可解释且有效的图像分类解决方案。

Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image
classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency
are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this
study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through
a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and
computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis
but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and
propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction
approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,
diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the
discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image
descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and
edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an
image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is
used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid
search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,
including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers
competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.
Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a
compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive
and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of
entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight
and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image
classification and computer vision.

Result: 生成了358k高质量三元组数据集NHR-Edit，并在实验中超越了所有公开替代方案。

Conclusion: 自动化方法显著提升了数据规模和编辑质量，推动了图像编辑助手的研究民主化。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source
fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our
experiments.

Motivation: 现有方法仅通过重述问题解决模糊提问，忽略了用户交互的潜力。

Method: 引入ClearVQA基准，针对三类常见模糊提问，并涵盖多种VQA场景。

Result: ClearVQA填补了评估VLM通过交互解决模糊提问能力的空白。

Conclusion: ClearVQA为交互式澄清提供了新方向，解决了VLM偏好回答而非提问的问题。

Abstract: In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous
questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits.
Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions.
These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions
with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However,
research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1)
Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities
through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than
asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three
common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA
scenarios.

Result: 实验证明了该方法在低监督数据情况下的有效性，并可作为现有方法的正则化器。

Conclusion: 显式聚类模块是一种简单有效的策略，适用于半监督学习和无监督域适应任务。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)
enhance the model performance by exploiting information from labeled and
unlabeled data. The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning
with limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same
cluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.
Recent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce
this assumption for the SSL and UDA. In this work, we take a different approach
by explicitly involving a differentiable clustering module which is extended to
leverage the supervised data to compute its centroids. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our straightforward end-to-end training strategy for SSL and
UDA over extensive experiments and highlight its benefits, especially in low
supervision regimes, both as a standalone model and as a regularizer for
existing approaches.

Motivation: 现有盲脸恢复方法因固定扩散采样时间步和全局引导尺度，导致保真度与质量不平衡。

Method: 利用高斯模糊图像及其核动态选择扩散起始时间步，并采用闭式引导和动态引导缩放调整器。

Result: DynFaceRestore在定量和定性评估中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了盲脸恢复中保真度与质量的平衡问题。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial
images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in
preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been
increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing
methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance
scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect
degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,
resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose
DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any
blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry
images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the
starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during
the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce
a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across
local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving
structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the
trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,
demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合在物联网感知中至关重要，但现有系统面临模型复杂、模态对齐不足和缺失数据鲁棒性差的问题。

Method: 结合线性复杂度的Mamba模型处理传感器时间序列，优化GRAM矩阵策略进行模态对齐，并引入低秩自适应层补偿缺失模态。

Result: 在SPAWC2021和USC-HAD数据集上表现优异，显著提升性能且仅需微调少量参数。

Conclusion: GRAM-MAMBA为资源受限环境中的多模态感知提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely
deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and
healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model
complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,
unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and
robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient
and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the
linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,
combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among
modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality
alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive
low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities
post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant
adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the
fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On
the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower
error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance
boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity
recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),
outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while
training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's
potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in
resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 现有方法需要为每种模态训练单独的主干网络，导致冗余和参数利用效率低，且自监督学习方法未充分考虑遥感图像的特性。

Method: 使用单一Transformer主干，结合自适应补丁合并模块、可学习模态提示令牌和专家混合模块（MoE），针对遥感数据特点进行预训练。

Result: 在7个任务的16个数据集上评估，平均性能比SkySense提升1.8分。

Conclusion: SkySense V2通过统一架构和针对性优化，显著提升了多模态遥感任务的性能。

Abstract: The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly
advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental
monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches
generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data
modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.
Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised
learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating
the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated
semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present
SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to
handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL
strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2
incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality
prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited
feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture
of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation
model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an
extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense
by an average of 1.8 points.

Abstract: Building segmentation in urban areas is essential in fields such as urban

buildings in dense urban regions presents challenges due to the large size and
high resolution of satellite images. This study investigates the use of a
Quanvolutional pre-processing to enhance the capability of the Attention U-Net
model in the building segmentation. Specifically, this paper focuses on the
urban landscape of Tunis, utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery. In this work, Quanvolution was used to extract more informative
feature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery,
proving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results
indicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the
standard Attention U-Net model while significantly reducing network parameters.
This result aligns with findings from previous works, confirming that
Quanvolution not only maintains model accuracy but also increases computational
efficiency. These promising outcomes highlight the potential of
quantum-assisted Deep Learning frameworks for large-scale building segmentation
in urban environments.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵传感器或深度真值数据，且假设相机参数已知，限制了其在大规模应用中的实用性。

Method: 采用双路径框架：鸟瞰路径提取空间信息，前视路径提取语义信息，结合3D车道锚点采样特征，并预测相机参数。

Result: 在OpenLane数据集上表现优异，且无需依赖相机标定。

Conclusion: Depth3DLane为单目3D车道检测提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案，适用于相机标定不可行的场景。

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but
challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information.
Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods
incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data
that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume
that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios
like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these
limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that
integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit
structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional
ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a
point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts
explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously
extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to
sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a
per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to
enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark
dataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters
instead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in
scenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.

Abstract: Recent subject-driven image customization has achieved significant
advancements in fidelity, yet fine-grained entity-level spatial control remains
elusive, hindering the broader real-world application. This limitation is
mainly attributed to scalable datasets that bind identity with precise
positional cues are absent. To this end, we introduce PositionIC, a unified
framework that enforces position and identity consistency for multi-subject
customization. We construct a scalable synthesis pipeline that employs a
bidirectional generation paradigm to eliminate subject drift and maintain
semantic coherence. On top of these data, we design a lightweight positional
modulation layer that decouples spatial embeddings among subjects, enabling
independent, accurate placement while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve precise spatial control
while maintaining high consistency in image customization task. PositionIC
paves the way for controllable, high-fidelity image customization in
open-world, multi-entity scenarios and will be released to foster further
research.

Result: 在多个真实场景实验中，PCR-GS显著提升了复杂相机轨迹下的3D重建质量。

Conclusion: PCR-GS通过双重正则化机制，有效解决了复杂相机轨迹下的3D高斯溅射问题。

Abstract: COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D
scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle
scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and
translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of
camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and
3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that
achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose
co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The
first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO
features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for
camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency
regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further
optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over
multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior
pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉基础模型的深度先验和LiDAR数据，有效提升了3D目标检测性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for
enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable
geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR
data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized
in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited
expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative
capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted
by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to
enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we
propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature
extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global
semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.
To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a
bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local
cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of
incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object
detection.

Result: 实验表明，TimeNeRF在少样本设置下无需逐场景优化即可渲染新视图，并能自然模拟从黎明到黄昏的复杂光照变化。

Conclusion: TimeNeRF为时间维度的3D场景建模提供了一种高效且泛化的解决方案，适用于元宇宙等沉浸式应用。

Abstract: We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering
novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input
views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views
and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital
realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive
experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition
between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing
novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling
remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this
end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance
fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our
model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us
to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and
further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.
Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.
Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting
without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic
novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing
intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.

*Marzieh Gheisari,Auguste Genovesio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiViD是一种端到端视频扩散框架，通过静态-动态显式分解解决视频中静态外观和动态运动的无监督解耦问题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VAE和GAN的方法存在信息泄漏和模糊重建问题，难以实现静态与动态的有效解耦。

Method: DiViD通过序列编码器提取全局静态标记和每帧动态标记，结合条件DDPM解码器，引入共享噪声计划、时变KL瓶颈和交叉注意力等归纳偏置，并使用正交正则化防止泄漏。

Result: DiViD在真实基准测试中表现优异，实现了最高的交换联合准确率，同时保持静态保真度和动态传递能力，减少了交叉泄漏。

Conclusion: DiViD为视频中静态与动态解耦提供了高效解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video
remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and
blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce
DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit
static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static
token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing
static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates
three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a
time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing
static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention
that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens
frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual
static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using
swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest
swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic
transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-powered surveillance have intensified concerns over the
collection and processing of sensitive personal data. In response, research has
increasingly focused on privacy-by-design solutions, raising the need for
objective techniques to evaluate privacy protection. This paper presents a
comprehensive framework for evaluating visual privacy-protection methods across
three dimensions: privacy, utility, and practicality. In addition, it
introduces HR-VISPR, a publicly available human-centric dataset with biometric,
soft-biometric, and non-biometric labels to train an interpretable privacy
metric. We evaluate 11 privacy protection methods, ranging from conventional
techniques to advanced deep-learning methods, through the proposed framework.
The framework differentiates privacy levels in alignment with human visual
perception, while highlighting trade-offs between privacy, utility, and
practicality. This study, along with the HR-VISPR dataset, serves as an
insightful tool and offers a structured evaluation framework applicable across
diverse contexts.

TL;DR: DreamScene是一个端到端框架，用于从文本或对话生成高质量、可编辑的3D场景，解决了自动化、3D一致性和细粒度控制的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在自动化、3D一致性和细粒度控制方面存在不足，限制了3D场景生成的实用性和灵活性。

Method: DreamScene结合了场景规划模块（GPT-4代理推断对象语义和空间约束）、基于图的布局算法、几何生成（FPS）和渐进相机采样策略。

Result: 实验表明，DreamScene在质量、一致性和灵活性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamScene为开放域3D内容创作提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for
applications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle
with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present
DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene
generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning
module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to
construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a
structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern
Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and
reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure
global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy
tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports
fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and
4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior
methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution
for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的两步法，用于隧道裂缝的分类和分割，提高了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隧道裂缝是隧道安全状态的关键指标，需要更准确和高效的方法进行分类和分割。

Method: 第一步使用DenseNet-169进行隧道图像分类，第二步基于DeepLabV3+进行裂缝分割，并通过评分加权可视化技术评估模型内部逻辑。

Result: 分类模型准确率92.23%，FPS 39.80；分割模型IoU 57.01%，F1分数67.44%，均优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 该方法结合分类和分割，提供快速准确的隧道健康状态评估，并通过可视化解释增强模型可理解性。

Abstract: Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming
to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,
this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel
image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first
step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the
DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual
explanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and
segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the
first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy
and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated
by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)
of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,
which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and
Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score
of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,
outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual
explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of
deep learning-based models. The developed two-stage deep learning-based method
integrating visual explanations provides a basis for fast and accurate
quantitative assessment of tunnel health status.

Conclusion: 结合多光谱成像与光谱-空间特征学习，有望推动植物表型和精准农业的发展。

Abstract: Accurate detection of nutrient deficiency in plant leaves is essential for
precision agriculture, enabling early intervention in fertilization, disease,
and stress management. This study presents a deep learning framework for leaf
anomaly segmentation using multispectral imaging and an enhanced YOLOv5 model
with a transformer-based attention head. The model is tailored for processing
nine-channel multispectral input and uses self-attention mechanisms to better
capture subtle, spatially-distributed symptoms. The plants in the experiments
were grown under controlled nutrient stress conditions for evaluation. We carry
out extensive experiments to benchmark the proposed model against the baseline
YOLOv5. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model significantly
outperforms the baseline YOLOv5, with an average Dice score and IoU
(Intersection over Union) improvement of about 12%. In particular, this model
is effective in detecting challenging symptoms like chlorosis and pigment
accumulation. These results highlight the promise of combining multi-spectral
imaging with spectral-spatial feature learning for advancing plant phenotyping
and precision agriculture.

TL;DR: 提出了一种情绪驱动的图像编辑方法，包括数据集MoodArchive、模型MoodifyCLIP和编辑工具Moodifier，实现了精确的情绪转换并保持内容完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情绪驱动的图像编辑在创意产业中潜力巨大，但由于情绪的抽象性和多样性，精确操作具有挑战性。

Method: 1. 构建MoodArchive数据集（8M+图像，带层次化情绪标注）；2. 开发MoodifyCLIP模型，将情绪映射为视觉属性；3. 提出Moodifier编辑模型，结合MLLMs实现精确编辑。

Result: Moodifier在情绪准确性和内容保持上优于现有方法，适用于多种领域（如角色表情、时尚设计等）。

Conclusion: 通过将抽象情绪与具体视觉变化关联，为实际应用中的情绪内容创作提供了新可能。

Abstract: Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds
great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains
challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied
manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an
integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we
introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical
emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human
evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned
on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes.
Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging
MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise
emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works
across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry,
and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations
while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations
show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and
content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking
abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new
possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We
will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier
code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为QuantEIT的超轻量级量子辅助推理框架，用于EIT图像重建，显著降低了模型复杂性和参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EIT是一种低成本、高时间分辨率的床边成像技术，但其逆问题具有不适定性，传统深度学习方法参数多且效率低。

Method: QuantEIT利用量子辅助网络（QA-Net），结合并行2量子位电路生成潜在表示，并通过单层线性层重建电导率，无需训练数据。

Result: 在模拟和真实2D/3D EIT肺部成像数据上，QuantEIT优于传统方法，仅用0.2%的参数实现更高精度和抗噪性。

Conclusion: QuantEIT首次将量子电路引入EIT重建，为高效、可扩展的床边监测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside
imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside
monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based
approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures
with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here,
we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework
for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network
(QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive
latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a
single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically
reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in
an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration
of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that
QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior
reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced
robustness to noise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Mamba的MTR框架通过结构感知重要性评分实现无需训练的token压缩，显著降低计算量且性能影响小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Vision Mamba的效率，解决直接应用ViT的token压缩技术导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出MTR框架，基于Mamba结构感知重要性评分评估token重要性，实现无需训练的token压缩。

Result: MTR在Vim-B骨干上减少约40% FLOPs，ImageNet性能仅下降1.6%。

Conclusion: MTR是一种高效、无需训练的token压缩方法，适用于多种Vision Mamba模型。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)
due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear
computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression
technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision
Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we
find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to
Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily
because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most
token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance
measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we
investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token
importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further
propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction
framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our
method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various
Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across
various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by
approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet
performance without retraining.

Motivation: 探索基础模型在皮肤病分类中的增量学习潜力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 冻结FM主干，为每个任务训练轻量级MLP；同时探索零训练场景下的原型分类方法。

Result: 方法在性能上优于正则化、回放和架构方法，原型分类也取得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 冻结FM在皮肤病持续学习中表现优异，支持其在医学应用中的广泛采用。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models
(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by
offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for
enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale
skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We
propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and
a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves
state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,
replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of
frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers
with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation
studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve
competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for
continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real
world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.

Motivation: 深度学习在监控视频异常检测中取得进展，但涉及敏感数据收集引发隐私问题，研究旨在评估匿名化技术对异常检测的影响。

Method: 在UCF-Crime数据集上应用模糊、掩码、加密和虚拟形象替换四种匿名化技术，评估四种异常检测方法（MGFN、UR-DMU、BN-WVAD、PEL4VAD）的性能。

Result: 实验表明，匿名化数据下异常检测仍可行，且某些匿名化模式（如加密和掩码）能意外提升部分模型的AUC性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了算法对匿名化的敏感性，强调了隐私保护与检测效用的权衡，并对比了传统匿名化与新兴隐私设计方案的差异。

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance
videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of
sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of
anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,
including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the
UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,
BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method
responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate
that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on
the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain
anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models
inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the
strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.
These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization
and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining
detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization
techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often
overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.
Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a
compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands
of anomaly detection.

TL;DR: C-DOG是一种无需训练的多视角多目标关联框架，结合图建模与极几何，提升3D重建中的目标关联鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在目标视觉相似或噪声干扰时失效的问题。

Method: 基于连接delta-overlap图建模与极几何，结合IQR过滤和3D反投影误差剔除不一致观测。

Result: 在合成基准测试中优于几何基线，适应高目标密度、无视觉特征和有限相机重叠等挑战。

Conclusion: C-DOG适用于实际场景中可扩展的3D重建。

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D
reconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances
across multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance
features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these
approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations
are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves
as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D
reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected
delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate
detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,
with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap
clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise
and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate
Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error
criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based
baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high
object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it
well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.

Result: 在多个下游基准测试中表现优异，性能与专有模型相当或更好。

Conclusion: Franca为透明、高性能视觉模型设定了新标准，推动了开源基础模型的发展。

Abstract: We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source
(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,
CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training
pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and
a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in
SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to
large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to
account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we
introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on
nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features
into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,
enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a
novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional
biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic
content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,
demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions
establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and
open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for
the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: GraphTrafficGPT提出了一种基于图的架构，通过并行执行和动态资源分配优化LLM驱动的交通管理任务，显著降低了令牌消耗和响应延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有链式系统（如TrafficGPT）在复杂交通场景中效率低下，存在顺序任务执行、高令牌使用和扩展性差的问题。

Method: 采用图结构表示任务及其依赖关系，引入Brain Agent分解查询、构建依赖图并协调多个专业代理。

Result: 实验显示，GraphTrafficGPT令牌消耗减少50.2%，响应延迟降低19.0%，多查询效率提升23.0%。

Conclusion: GraphTrafficGPT通过图架构显著提升了交通管理任务的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for intelligent
traffic management; however, current chain-based systems like TrafficGPT are
hindered by sequential task execution, high token usage, and poor scalability,
making them inefficient for complex, real-world scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture,
which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven
traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies
as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution
and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a
Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency
graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval,
analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware
token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed
architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility
environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces
token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to
TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to
23.0% improvement in efficiency.

Motivation: 当前偏好模型将人类判断视为黑箱，缺乏对偏好背后原因的理解。

Conclusion: PrefPalette提供了更优的偏好建模和透明见解，是迈向可信个性化应用的第一步。

Abstract: Personalizing AI systems requires understanding not just what users prefer,
but the reasons that underlie those preferences - yet current preference models
typically treat human judgment as a black box. We introduce PrefPalette, a
framework that decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its
preference prediction to distinct social community values in a
human-interpretable manner. PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science
principle known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable
counterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic
training data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,
humor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that
learns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.
This approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse
evaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social
communities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by
46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,
PrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:
scholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented
communities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities
emphasize empathy. By modeling the attribute-mediated structure of human
judgment, PrefPalette delivers both superior preference modeling and
transparent, interpretable insights, and serves as a first step toward more
trustworthy, value-aware personalized applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型（LLMs）和符号系统的新方法，以可控透明的方式开发专家系统，解决LLMs的幻觉和不可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在知识系统中表现优异，但存在幻觉和生成不可验证事实的问题，需要一种可控透明的方法来开发可靠专家系统。

Method: 通过限制领域和结构化提示提取知识，生成Prolog符号表示，并由专家验证和修正，确保可解释性、可扩展性和可靠性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在事实一致性和语义连贯性上表现优异，结合了LLMs的召回能力和符号系统的精确性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种透明混合解决方案，为敏感领域构建可靠AI应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has successfully transformed
knowledge-based systems such as open domain question nswering, which can
automatically produce vast amounts of seemingly coherent information. Yet,
those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident
generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a
new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled
and transparent way. By limiting the domain and employing a well-structured
prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of
knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts.
This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of
the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with
Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic
coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid
solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of
symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications
in sensitive domains.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI应关注实体及其关系建模，而非仅关注像素和文字，并分析了关系学习未普及的原因及改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI主要建模像素和文字，但世界由实体及其关系构成，应直接建模这些实体。

Method: 分析关系学习（如统计关系AI）的现状及其在数据中的实际应用（如数据库、电子表格）。

Result: 关系学习仅在有限场景中应用，未成为主流。

Conclusion: 需改进关系学习方法以提升其在实际应用中的重要性。

Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words,
and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes
but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and
relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or
description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and
pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text
and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most
valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These
are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are
full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other
identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that
studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning,
statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational
learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted
relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.

TL;DR: BifrostRAG是一个双图RAG系统，通过结合实体网络图和文档导航图，显著提升了多跳问题回答的准确性和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RAG系统在处理复杂法规文本和多跳查询时的局限性。

Method: 引入双图架构（实体网络图和文档导航图），结合图遍历和向量语义搜索。

Result: 在多跳问题数据集上，BifrostRAG的精确率为92.8%，召回率为85.5%，F1得分为87.3%。

Conclusion: BifrostRAG为复杂技术文档的处理提供了可迁移的解决方案，显著优于单模态RAG系统。

Abstract: Information retrieval and question answering from safety regulations are
essential for automated construction compliance checking but are hindered by
the linguistic and structural complexity of regulatory text. Many
compliance-related queries are multi-hop, requiring synthesis of information
across interlinked clauses. This poses a challenge for traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. To overcome this, we introduce
BifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both
linguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure
(via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval
mechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search,
enabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the
structure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that
BifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1
score of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and
graph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error
analysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method
over single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust
knowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking. Its dual-graph, hybrid
retrieval mechanism offers a transferable blueprint for navigating complex
technical documents across knowledge-intensive engineering domains.

Motivation: 解决学生在分步任务中组合步骤导致的错误诊断困难，利用最终答案简化诊断过程。

Result: 29.4%的步骤可被诊断，与教师诊断一致率达97%。

Conclusion: 基于最终答案的诊断方法有效，为后续研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Many intelligent tutoring systems can support a student in solving a stepwise
task. When a student combines several steps in one step, the number of possible
paths connecting consecutive inputs may be very large. This combinatorial
explosion makes error diagnosis hard. Using a final answer to diagnose a
combination of steps can mitigate the combinatorial explosion, because there
are generally fewer possible (erroneous) final answers than (erroneous)
solution paths. An intermediate input for a task can be diagnosed by
automatically completing it according to the task solution strategy and
diagnosing this solution. This study explores the potential of automated error
diagnosis based on a final answer. We investigate the design of a service that
provides a buggy rule diagnosis when a student combines several steps. To
validate the approach, we apply the service to an existing dataset (n=1939) of
unique student steps when solving quadratic equations, which could not be
diagnosed by a buggy rule service that tries to connect consecutive inputs with
a single rule. Results show that final answer evaluation can diagnose 29,4% of
these steps. Moreover, a comparison of the generated diagnoses with teacher
diagnoses on a subset (n=115) shows that the diagnoses align in 97% of the
cases. These results can be considered a basis for further exploration of the
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型追踪和约束建模在诊断学生输入时的局限性，尤其是当学生将多个步骤合并为一步时。

Method: 通过定义约束作为学生输入与策略步骤的共同属性，设计了一个多步策略诊断系统。

Result: 系统诊断与教师编码在140个学生步骤中完全一致。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了两种范式，能够准确诊断学生的多步输入。

Abstract: Model tracing and constraint-based modeling are two approaches to diagnose
student input in stepwise tasks. Model tracing supports identifying consecutive
problem-solving steps taken by a student, whereas constraint-based modeling
supports student input diagnosis even when several steps are combined into one
step. We propose an approach that merges both paradigms. By defining
constraints as properties that a student input has in common with a step of a
strategy, it is possible to provide a diagnosis when a student deviates from a
strategy even when the student combines several steps. In this study we explore
the design of a system for multistep strategy diagnoses, and evaluate these
diagnoses. As a proof of concept, we generate diagnoses for an existing dataset
containing steps students take when solving quadratic equations (n=2136). To
compare with human diagnoses, two teachers coded a random sample of deviations
(n=70) and applications of the strategy (n=70). Results show that that the
system diagnosis aligned with the teacher coding in all of the 140 student
steps.

Motivation: 现有活动日志生成方法在准确性、效率和语义丰富性方面存在不足，而LLM的语义理解和生成能力为解决这些问题提供了新机会。

Method: DailyLLM采用轻量级LLM框架，结合结构化提示和高效特征提取，实现高级活动理解。

Conclusion: DailyLLM通过多维度上下文整合和轻量级设计，显著提升了活动日志生成的性能，为行为分析和健康监测提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Rich and context-aware activity logs facilitate user behavior analysis and
health monitoring, making them a key research focus in ubiquitous computing.
The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log
generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations
in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these
challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates
contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion,
environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on
smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a
lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with
efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art
(SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal
computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM
achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to
the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference
speed.

Method: OntView基于DL推理器，采用“所见即所得”范式，支持可视化通用概念包含（GCI），并提供简化视图功能，如本体摘要、聚焦TBox元素和动态隐藏/显示分支。

Result: OntView成功实现了直观的本体可视化，避免了信息过载，并通过开源许可发布。

Conclusion: OntView为知识管理领域提供了一种有效的本体可视化工具，弥补了现有工具的不足。

Abstract: In the field of knowledge management and computer science, ontologies provide
a structured framework for modeling domain-specific knowledge by defining
concepts and their relationships. However, the lack of tools that provide
effective visualization is still a significant challenge. While numerous
ontology editors and viewers exist, most of them fail to graphically represent
ontology structures in a meaningful and non-overwhelming way, limiting users'
ability to comprehend dependencies and properties within large ontological
frameworks.
  In this paper, we present OntView, an ontology viewer that is designed to
provide users with an intuitive visual representation of ontology concepts and
their formal definitions through a user-friendly interface. Building on the use
of a DL reasoner, OntView follows a "What you see is what you meant" paradigm,
showing the actual inferred knowledge. One key aspect for this is its ability
to visualize General Concept Inclusions (GCI), a feature absent in existing
visualization tools. Moreover, to avoid a possible information overload,
OntView also offers different ways to show a simplified view of the ontology
by: 1) creating ontology summaries by assessing the importance of the concepts
(according to different available algorithms), 2) focusing the visualization on
the existing TBox elements between two given classes and 3) allowing to
hide/show different branches in a dynamic way without losing the semantics.

Abstract: We present a hybrid architecture for agent-augmented strategic reasoning,
combining heuristic extraction, semantic activation, and compositional
synthesis. Drawing on sources ranging from classical military theory to
contemporary corporate strategy, our model activates and composes multiple
heuristics through a process of semantic interdependence inspired by research
in quantum cognition. Unlike traditional decision engines that select the best
rule, our system fuses conflicting heuristics into coherent and
context-sensitive narratives, guided by semantic interaction modeling and
rhetorical framing. We demonstrate the framework via a Meta vs. FTC case study,
with preliminary validation through semantic metrics. Limitations and
extensions (e.g., dynamic interference tuning) are discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T-GNN在建模时间和结构依赖时计算开销大，难以扩展。EAGLE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: EAGLE包含时间感知模块和结构感知模块，通过自适应权重机制平衡两者，避免复杂计算。

Result: 在七个真实世界动态图上，EAGLE在效果和效率上均优于现有T-GNN，速度提升50倍以上。

Conclusion: EAGLE通过轻量级设计，实现了高效且高性能的时间链接预测。

Abstract: Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a critical task with
applications in diverse domains such as social networks, recommendation
systems, and e-commerce platforms. While existing Temporal Graph Neural
Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex
architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer
from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead.
In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates
short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE
consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most
recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware
module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence
of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an
adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on
data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop
message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant
improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal
graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance
against state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency,
delivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.

Abstract: [Context] Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved notable
success in environments where agents must learn coordinated behaviors. However,
transferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary
environments with changing goals. [Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer
methods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly
retraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge
transfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal
representations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the
environment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive
recovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention
instantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect
corresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while
increasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative
reward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent
and is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by
querying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results]
Our findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were
able to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully
retrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of
causal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment
complexity and agents' heterogeneous goals.

Abstract: Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language
models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and
relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during
training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt
engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics
and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and
difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic
latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by
navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our
framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains,
input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage
prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary
results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI
collaboration.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了因果推理与多模态学习结合在神经疾病诊断中的潜力。

Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's
Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow
the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant
challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection
bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To
address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention
framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal
Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language
model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining
structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.
The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)
images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into
Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of
confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,
non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,
generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates
confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The
study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal
learning for neurological disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic systems with a fine-grained temporal and numeric

a novel temporal and constraint-based extension of the logic of Here-and-There
and its nonmonotonic equilibrium extension, representing, to the best of our
knowledge, the first approach to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning with
constraints specifically tailored for ASP. This expressive system is achieved
by a synergistic combination of two foundational ASP extensions: the
linear-time logic of Here-and-There, providing robust nonmonotonic temporal
reasoning capabilities, and the logic of Here-and-There with constraints,
enabling the direct integration and manipulation of numeric constraints, among
others. This work establishes the foundational logical framework for tackling
complex dynamic systems with high resolution within the ASP paradigm.

Abstract: Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability,
yet existing systems often rely on handcrafted rules or specialized models with
limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses
Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with
structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance
and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a
lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and
substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge
retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching,
outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches
while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the
feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted
knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology
matching at scale.

Abstract: Human motion simulation (HMS) supports cost-effective evaluation of worker
behavior, safety, and productivity in industrial tasks. However, existing
methods often suffer from low motion fidelity. This study introduces
Generative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and
text-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks.
G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into
motion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's
training vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human
movements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to
real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are
used to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving
eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created
descriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial
accuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven
tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that
AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and
temporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy.

Abstract: Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities,
and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing
structural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and
requires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this
analysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities
for interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in
providing detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for
integrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted
analysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study,
several LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the
quality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different
NDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions.
Each LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed
descriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and
demonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine
models provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of
topics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models
are summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of
the bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more
effective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to
significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an
innovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and
summarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and
enhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.

TL;DR: CUDA-L1是一种基于强化学习的自动化CUDA优化框架，显著提升了CUDA内核的性能，并展示了跨GPU架构的优异可移植性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型的快速发展，对GPU计算资源的需求激增，亟需自动化CUDA优化策略。现有模型在CUDA优化任务中成功率低，因此开发了CUDA-L1。

Method: CUDA-L1采用强化学习框架，通过速度提升奖励信号训练模型，无需人工专业知识或领域知识。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100上训练后，CUDA-L1在KernelBench的250个CUDA内核上平均提速17.7倍，峰值达449倍，并在其他GPU架构上也表现优异。

Conclusion: CUDA-L1证明了强化学习可将性能较差的LLM转化为高效的CUDA优化器，并为自动化CUDA操作优化开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the
rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for
automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show
promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low
success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an
automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.
  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:
trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250
CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the
model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,
achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,
x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.
Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable
properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns
to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers
fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious
performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that
harm performance.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can
transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer
through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain
knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning
abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated
optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU
efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.
