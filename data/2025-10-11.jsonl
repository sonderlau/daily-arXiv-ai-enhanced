A case study on industrial potato chip frying provides\nthe application context. During each two-minute frying cycle, sequences of\neight temperature readings are collected. Each sequence is treated as a digital\nant depositing virtual pheromones, generating a Base Score. New sequences,\nrepresenting new ants, can either reinforce or weaken this score, leading to a\nModified Base Score that reflects the system's evolving condition. Signals such\nas extreme temperatures, large variations within a sequence, or the detection\nof change-points contribute to a Threat Score, which is added to the Modified\nBase Score. Since pheromones naturally decay over time unless reinforced, an\nEnvironmental Score is incorporated to reflect recent system dynamics,\nimitating real ant behavior. This score is calculated from the Modified Base\nScores collected over the past hour. The resulting Total Score - the sum of the\nModified Base Score, Threat Score, and Environmental Score - is used as the\nmain indicator for real-time system classification and forecasting of\ntransitions from InC to OutC.

Machine learning (ML) parameterizations\ntrained on short high-resolution simulations show strong potential to reduce\nthese errors. However, stable long-term atmospheric simulations with hybrid\n(physics + ML) ESMs remain difficult, as neural networks (NNs) trained offline\noften destabilize online runs. Training convection parameterizations directly\non coarse-grained data is challenging, notably because scales cannot be cleanly\nseparated. This issue is mitigated using data from superparameterized\nsimulations, which provide clearer scale separation.

Here, we present a proof-of-concept\nwhere a ClimSim-trained, physics-informed NN convection parameterization is\nsuccessfully transferred to ICON-A.

L2M-AID orchestrates a team\nof collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to\nachieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep\nfusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to\ntranslate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state\nrepresentation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than\nmerely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative\nstrategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security\nobjectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly\npenalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability.

(ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a\nsingle model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,\nhowever, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the\nbetter video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To\naddress these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of\nsystematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with\n45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V\nmodels. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background\nscene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene\nconsistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion\nsmoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric\nshows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:\nocclusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.\nBuilding on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages\nobject error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our\nsecond innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that\ntracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object\nfidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve\nstronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the\nmodel level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval\nas a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic\ncamera motion."}

A\nsignificant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their\nreliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or\nsecurity concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time\nGraph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without\naccessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as\na generative graph restoration problem, \"restoring the target graph to its\npristine, source-domain-like state\". There are two key challenges: (1) We need\nto construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective\nencoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We\nneed to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic\nfeatures of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To\nensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores\nthe target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.\nSpecifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent\nfeatures and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration\nprocess. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete\ntokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to\ntransform a \"noisy\" target graph into a \"native\" one. To further improve\nrestoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by\nspecialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach across various datasets."}

RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends\nusing short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and\nghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains\nsufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in\ndenoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB\nimages, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise\ncharacteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This\nraises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only\na single short-exposure RAW image?

This compels the model to\nlearn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across\ndifferent viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is\ncomplemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a\nphysically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This\nprevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to\nmore stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our\nmethod is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive\nexperiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around\n1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and\nrobustness under demanding 4K rendering."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled\nnew scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command\nadherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To\nreduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism\nby limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles\nfollow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an\nLLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive\n3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment\nbetween the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback\ncalibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity\nto user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,\ninteractive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors\nusing both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding\nthem. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that\nenhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate\nscenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language\ndescriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;\ncomfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces\nexcessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash\nrate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions."}

As a complementary to existing\nnon-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of\nprediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training\npipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique\ncoupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions.

While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR\nhave set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can\nbe a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical\ntrade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art\nSwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\non this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but\nimportant finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher\npeak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the\nlightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel\nframework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based\nreasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our\nframework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved\ntext-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where\na textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a\npositional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new\ncontent.

Specifically, S3FN\nleverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class\nlabel that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These\ndescriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text\nencoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in\nturn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification\nperformance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our\nmodel on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,\nHyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance\nboost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and\nspectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically\naugmented HSI classification models.

Experimental results on 14 multimodal\nbenchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.\nBesides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future\nstudy of native MLLMs."}

In this work, we identify two key failure modes under\nsparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density\nnear the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian\ncoverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,\ncomprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that\nsuppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on\ndensity and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that\nimproves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through\ntargeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to\nquantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights\ninto the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple\ndatasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality\nand robustness under sparse view conditions.

We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting\nmodel that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing\ngradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error\nserves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn\neffective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen\ndata distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize\nthe recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that\noperates in a $16 \\times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \\times$ fewer\nGaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces\ncomputational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive\nexperiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \\times\n256$ to $540 \\times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate\nthat our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly\nreducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed.

We revisit this problem and show\nthat widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model\ncapability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better\nexploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both\ncontrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test\ntime transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard\nevaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables\nSigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first\nresult surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.\n  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,\nself-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any\nexternal supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for\nexample, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a\nnew state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on\nbenchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving\nrelative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp.

We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while\nmonitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model\nfamilies. We observe that apparent \"forgetting\" on held-out tasks after narrow\nfine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a\nmeasurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple\ncounting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we\nidentify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting\ndrift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)\nupdating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models\nand tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving\nheld-out performance. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/jessemelpolio/LMM_CL"}
