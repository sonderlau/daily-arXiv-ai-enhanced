However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention\nambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and\nomission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic\nselection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of\ndifferent parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a\nMulti-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:\n(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language\nmodels to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,\nconsidering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature\nextraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and\nvisual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level\nmixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch\nmixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from\nrelevant regions of information.

However,\ntheir generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and\nsocietal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or\ncopyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning\n(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable\nconcepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness\nof existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in\nthe presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework\nexplicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike\nexisting approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall\nexploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion\nmodels by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a\nsingle semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten\nstate-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall\nconsistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial\neffectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the\noriginal textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in\ncurrent unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions\nto ensure the safety and reliability of generative models.

By operating on 0/1\nspikes emitted by neurons instead of arithmetic multiply-and-accumulate\noperations, SNNs propagate information temporally and spatially, allowing for\nmore efficient compute power. To this end, many architectures for accelerating\nand simulating SNNs have been developed, including Loihi, TrueNorth, and\nSpiNNaker. However, these chips are largely inaccessible to the wider\ncommunity. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been explored to serve\nas a middle ground between neuromorphic and non-neuromorphic hardware, but many\nproposed architectures require expensive high-end FPGAs or target a single SNN\ntopology. This paper presents a framework consisting of a robust SNN\nacceleration architecture and a Pytorch-based SNN model compiler. Targeting\nany-to-any and/or fully connected SNNs, the FPGA architecture features a\nsynaptic array that tiles across the SNN to propagate spikes. The architecture\ntargets low-end FPGAs and requires very little (6358 LUT, 40.5 BRAM) resources.\nThe framework, tested on a low-end Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA at 100 MHz, achieves\ncompetitive speed in recognizing MNIST digits (0.52 ms/img).

Recent data, for example,\nshows that neurons in mouse visual cortex go into a \"low power mode\" in which\nthey maintain firing rate homeostasis while expending less energy. This\nadaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in\nresponse to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding\nframework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple\nconstraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit\ntied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. A key feature of our\ncontribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP) use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework\nthat generalizes existing optimal population codes.

Our insight highlights the necessity of a more\nrobust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on\nbiased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive\nsampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning).

We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS\ndatasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias.

In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:\nthe Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better\nmulti-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)\nmodule to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary\nreconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,\nCVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Existing\nmethods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,\nclothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we\nexplore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a\nlightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID\nmodels. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that\nleverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI\nefficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while\ndisentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To\nachieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to\nprevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature\nspace. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color\nembeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when\nexplicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nCSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID\ndatasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for\nimage-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID\nwithout relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential\nof color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in\nCC-ReID.

Our work studies the\nalignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of\nunsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the\ninput prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after\ngeneration. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering\nboth prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there\nare no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful\nbehavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable\nfrom benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies\na natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All\nof our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions.

However, training such models typically requires\nlarge-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive\nto collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that\nenhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth\ncompletion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and\nconsistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,\nallowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.\nThis process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales\nof the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new\ndata synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale\nmanipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied\nscene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring\nprojection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify\ngeometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as\nunlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of\nfoundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable\ngeneralizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene\nsemantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot\nsettings.

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to\nbe the most predictive.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u5c0f\u63d0\u7434\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u7f29\u51cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u533a\u5206\u7f29\u51cf\u4e0e\u975e\u7f29\u51cf\u5c0f\u63d0\u7434\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570beta\u6700\u5177\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c0f\u63d0\u7434\u5236\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u7f29\u51cf\u73b0\u8c61\u5bf9\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7ebf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e13\u5bb6\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf925\u628a\u5c0f\u63d0\u7434\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u7f51\u683c\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u6805\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u53d610-20\u6761\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7ebf\uff0c\u62df\u5408\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u66f2\u7ebf\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u7f29\u51cf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u533a\u5206\u7f29\u51cf\u4e0e\u975e\u7f29\u51cf\u5c0f\u63d0\u7434\uff0c\u53c2\u6570beta\u6700\u5177\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u5c0f\u63d0\u7434\u7f29\u51cf\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6ce8\u610f\u5b58\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u7684\u7f29\u51cf\u7a0b\u5ea6\u96be\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u3002"}}

However, its inherent characteristics often introduce\nsubstantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ\nsegmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we\npropose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to\nenhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual\nsemantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we\nintroduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a\nchannel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,\neffectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on\npixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global\nSemantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional\nlocal features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with\nconditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent\nframes. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,\nsignificantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive\nevaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy.

Adverse weather significantly degrades\nimage quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face\nimage restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)\nand diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due\nto the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced\ndegradations.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework\nthat integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature\nTransformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The\nlocal SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the\nlocal statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those\nof high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables\nrobust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions\nby aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration\nprocess adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations.

Existing methods typically represent\nthe human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic\nphysical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and\nmakes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we\npropose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human\ntopology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To\npreserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial\nfield for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal\ndependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.\nInter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the\ndependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant\nmultilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group\nthrough parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical\nplausibility.

Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and\ndepth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often\ntrade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge\nthis gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a\nplug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and\na dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D\nflood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to\nmultispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer\nmodel to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without\nchanging the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is\nbased on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the\n2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood\nboundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case\nstudy on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled\nwith SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\\%.

Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object\ntracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a\ntransformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator\nlinear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our\nmodels assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second\nwith 24/7 cage coverage.

Inspired by Kolmogorov\nComplexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which\npredicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward\npass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a\nproxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely\nresembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to\nconditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.\nKARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a\nsingle pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of\nencoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.\nAdditionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive\nImage Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted\nimage complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.\nout-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u6b21\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u8bcd\u5668KARL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u63cf\u8ff0\u957f\u5ea6\uff08\u8fd1\u4f3cKolmogorov\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff09\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5206\u8bcd\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u4f46\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b21\u7f16\u7801\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "method": "KARL\u57fa\u4e8eKolmogorov\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65f6\u505c\u6b62\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5012\u7f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "KARL\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u5668/\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u8bcd\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "KARL\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8bcd\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning\noutcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU\nloss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic\nexpression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted\non three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal\ndatasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture\noutperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional\narithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate\nthe potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance\nissues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression\nknowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label\nimbalance, or minor class problems.

Recently,\nMamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision\ntasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state\nscanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images\neffectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth\nlabels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater\nimages and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we\ndevelop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating\naccurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we\npropose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum\nspanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features\namong the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and\ntop-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation\ncapabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark\n(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with\nreliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for\ntraining existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate\nobject-depth relationships.

While current markerless methods\nmostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored\nin this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.\n  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung\ntumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are\nevaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)\napproach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)\nmodel designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the\nlimited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment\nsessions.\n  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning\n4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was\nheld out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's\nplanning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion\nover a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement\nError (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and\ntreatment (T2) data.\n  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set\nsizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,\nMP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical\nvariability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.\n  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless\ntumor motion forecasting.

In this\npaper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16\ndifferent datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.\nThe code for THUNDER is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/MICS-Lab/thunder.", "AI": {"tldr": "THUNDER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u6613\u7528\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u8fd1\u671f\u6d8c\u73b0\u5927\u91cf\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1THUNDER\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u652f\u630123\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u572816\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "THUNDER\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "THUNDER\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

They are a critical tool\nin applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater\nconstruction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image\nrestoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited\ndepth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate\nunrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and\nsignificant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by\ncombining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data\ngeneration pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --\nwhich encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an\nexplicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the\neffects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a\nphysics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and\nrealistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image\ndatasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with\ndense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on\nboth synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art\nperformance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based\nmethods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It\nalso offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data.

Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance\nAngiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,\nhowever, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,\noverlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular\nchanges. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and\nmorphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face\nchallenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and\nlack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel\nsemi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based\ntoolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,\nachieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with\nminimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based\nlandmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively\naddressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human\nsubjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved\nsensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing\nsemi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative\nfeature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework\nutilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for\nspecific artery types.

Despite their popularity, their representations show major\nlimitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,\nas a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of \"a yellow\nsubmarine and a blue bus\" or \"a blue submarine and a yellow bus\". Previous\nattempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the\narchitecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect\nthat the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in\nthe arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this\nwork, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data\nproperties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We\nfind that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,\nincomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to\ndescribe the object that is \"most salient\" to them have a detrimental effect on\nbinding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling\nthe batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly\ncreating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding.

However,\nthe role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional\ngeneralization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when\na common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this\npaper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining\ndataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM\nperformance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from\nsingle-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual\ninformation (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words\nco-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using\nsynthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a\nstrong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot\naccuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap\nbetween images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even\naccuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the\nimage. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by\nediting them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of\nr=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs\nbuilt on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2).
