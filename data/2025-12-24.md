### [1] [Even Small Companies Can Save Lives by Reducing Emissions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20473)
*Daniel Baldassare,Abby Lute,Hikari Murayama,Cora Kingdon,Christopher Schwalm*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究通过创新建模技术，计算了3084家公司减排承诺可避免的死亡人数，发现97%以上的公司至少能拯救1条生命，所有公司履约可避免440万例与温度相关的死亡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前全球变暖讨论常聚焦于1.5°C、2°C等宏观阈值，导致企业认为个体减排努力在缺乏集体行动时无意义，从而降低减排雄心。需要重新构建框架，关注企业个体行动的生命拯救潜力，以激励企业行动并追究其不作为的责任。

Method: 采用创新建模技术：1) 基于3084家不同规模和行业公司的报告排放量和计划减排量，创建2020-2049年有/无减排承诺的情景；2) 使用气候模拟器计算2020-2100年的变暖结果；3) 利用死亡率损害函数，根据温度情景计算由变暖导致的死亡人数。

Result: 研究发现：1) 超过97%的公司通过履行减排计划至少能拯救1条生命；2) 如果所有3084家公司都履行减排计划，可避免超过440万例与温度相关的死亡。

Conclusion: 将气候变化讨论从宏观阈值转向企业个体行动的生命拯救潜力，能够有效激励企业减排并追究其责任。企业减排努力具有显著的生命拯救价值，这一视角转变对推动企业气候行动至关重要。

Abstract: Global warming is often framed in broad planetary numbers such as the 1.5 C and 2 C warming thresholds, creating the false impression that individual corporations efforts to reduce emissions are meaningless in the absence of collective action. This perspective causes companies to reduce ambition towards voluntarily cutting emissions, as they believe their pollution has negligible impacts on its own. Reframing the issue to focus on the life-saving potential of individual corporate actions empowers companies to act and holds them accountable for inaction. Here, we show the results from an innovative modeling technique which calculates the avoided deaths from sustainability efforts for 3,084 companies spanning a range of sizes and sectors. From the reported emissions and planned emissions reductions, we create scenarios for 2020-2049 with and without the pledged emissions cuts and calculate the resulting warming from 2020-2100 using a climate emulator. We then use temperatures from these scenarios to calculate the deaths resulting from warming by using mortality damage functions. We find that more than 97% of these companies stand to save at least one life by following through with emissions reduction plans. Additionally, if all 3,084 companies follow through with their emissions reduction plans, over 4.4 million temperature-related deaths can be avoided.

### [2] [Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search with Dual Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20112)
*Xian-Rong Zhang,Yue-Jiao Gong,Wei-Neng Chen,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: DCL-ENAS提出了一种基于双重对比学习的进化神经架构搜索方法，通过自监督对比学习和微调对比学习训练神经预测器，在有限计算预算下实现高性能架构搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ENAS中神经预测器需要大量完全训练的架构-标签对作为训练数据，计算成本高昂。如何在有限计算预算下获得高精度预测器是ENAS成功的关键挑战。

Method: 提出DCL-ENAS方法，包含两个对比学习阶段：1）自监督对比学习，从无标签的神经架构中学习有意义的表示；2）微调对比学习，准确预测架构的相对性能而非绝对性能，以指导进化搜索。

Result: 在NASBench-101和NASBench-201上达到最高验证准确率，比最强基线提升0.05%（ImageNet16-120）到0.39%（NASBench-101）。在真实ECG心律失常分类任务中，比手动设计的非NAS模型性能提升约2.5个百分点，仅需7.7 GPU天。

Conclusion: DCL-ENAS通过双重对比学习有效降低了神经预测器的训练数据需求，在有限计算预算下实现了高性能的神经架构搜索，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) has gained attention for automatically designing neural network architectures. Recent studies use a neural predictor to guide the process, but the high computational costs of gathering training data -- since each label requires fully training an architecture -- make achieving a high-precision predictor with { limited compute budget (i.e., a capped number of fully trained architecture-label pairs)} crucial for ENAS success. This paper introduces ENAS with Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL-ENAS), a novel method that employs two stages of contrastive learning to train the neural predictor. In the first stage, contrastive self-supervised learning is used to learn meaningful representations from neural architectures without requiring labels. In the second stage, fine-tuning with contrastive learning is performed to accurately predict the relative performance of different architectures rather than their absolute performance, which is sufficient to guide the evolutionary search. Across NASBench-101 and NASBench-201, DCL-ENAS achieves the highest validation accuracy, surpassing the strongest published baselines by 0.05\% (ImageNet16-120) to 0.39\% (NASBench-101). On a real-world ECG arrhythmia classification task, DCL-ENAS improves performance by approximately 2.5 percentage points over a manually designed, non-NAS model obtained via random search, while requiring only 7.7 GPU-days.

### [3] [Memory as Resonance: A Biomimetic Architecture for Infinite Context Memory on Ergodic Phonetic Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20245)
*Tarik Houichime,Abdelghani Souhar,Younes El Amrani*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM)架构，将语言编码为连续路径而非离散张量序列，通过几何信号与生成重建解耦，实现3000倍压缩和92%事实准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的记忆存在物理悖论：线性累积的Key-Value状态将上下文视为静态仓库，最终迫使在遗忘和延迟之间做出破坏性选择。作者挑战这种离散正统观念，认为长期记忆不是项目的存储，而是轨迹的持久性。

Method: 引入Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM)，一种神经符号架构，将语言编码为在无理旋转矩阵控制的遍历流形上的连续路径。通过将导航（不变的O(1)几何信号）与重建（概率生成行为）解耦，实现压缩。

Result: PTM实现相对于密集缓存的3000倍以上压缩，通过"信号共识"机制稳定模型对抗幻觉，达到约92%的事实准确率，同时保持约34ms的即时访问延迟（与深度无关）。

Conclusion: 无限上下文不需要无限硅资源，而是需要将记忆视为作用于守恒、不灭物理信号的重建过程，而非待存储的数据。

Abstract: The memory of contemporary Large Language Models is bound by a physical paradox: as they learn, they fill up. The linear accumulation (O(N)) of Key-Value states treats context as a warehouse of static artifacts, eventually forcing a destructive choice between amnesia and latency. We challenge this discrete orthodoxy, proposing that long-term memory is not the storage of items, but the persistence of a trajectory. We introduce Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes language not as a sequence of tensors, but as a continuous path on an ergodic manifold governed by irrational rotation matrices. By decoupling the navigation (an invariant O(1) geometric signal) from the reconstruction (a probabilistic generative act), PTM achieves a compression magnitude of greater than 3,000x relative to dense caches. We demonstrate that retrieval becomes a process of resonance: the phonetic trace stabilizes the model against hallucination via "Signal Consensus" mechanism, securing up to approximately 92% factual accuracy. While this aggressive abstraction alters generative texture, it unlocks immediate access latency (approximately 34ms) independent of depth. Our results suggest that infinite context does not require infinite silicon; it requires treating memory not as data to be stored, but as a reconstructive process acting on a conserved, undying physical signal.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出新生儿/成人脑图谱（NABA），一个统一的白质纤维束图谱，支持新生儿与成人之间的直接白质连接比较，用于研究典型脑发育和神经疾病生物标志物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有白质图谱都是针对特定人群（成人或新生儿）且位于不同空间，无法直接进行跨人群比较，缺乏一个统一的新生儿-成人白质图谱。

Method: 使用稳健的数据驱动纤维聚类流程，基于新生儿和成人的扩散MRI数据构建NABA图谱，实现跨人群的群体白质图谱构建，提供标准化的白质分区模板。

Result: NABA能稳健识别两个人群的白质纤维束；发现长程联合纤维束（如弓状束、上纵束II）的FA发育较快，而小脑内纤维束发育较慢；新生儿女性FA发育整体快于男性；早产儿整体FA发育率较低，但在特定纤维束（如皮质脊髓束、放射冠-桥脑通路、小脑内纤维束）表现出相对较高的FA增长。

Conclusion: NABA是研究新生儿和成人白质发育的有用工具，支持跨人群的白质比较分析，有助于理解典型脑发育和识别神经疾病生物标志物。

Abstract: Comparing white matter (WM) connections between adults and neonates using diffusion MRI (dMRI) can advance our understanding of typical brain development and potential biomarkers for neurological disorders. However, existing WM atlases are population-specific (adult or neonatal) and reside in separate spaces, preventing direct cross-population comparisons. A unified WM atlas spanning both neonates and adults is still lacking. In this study, we propose a neonatal/adult brain atlas (NABA), a WM tractography atlas built from dMRI data of both neonates and adults. NABA is constructed using a robust, data-driven fiber clustering pipeline, enabling group-wise WM atlasing across populations despite substantial anatomical variability. The atlas provides a standardized template for WM parcellation, allowing direct comparison of WM tracts between neonates and adults. Using NABA, we conduct four analyses: (1) evaluating the feasibility of joint WM mapping across populations, (2) characterizing WM development across neonatal ages relative to adults, (3) assessing sex-related differences in neonatal WM development, and (4) examining the effects of preterm birth. Our results show that NABA robustly identifies WM tracts in both populations. We observe rapid fractional anisotropy (FA) development in long-range association tracts, including the arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus II, whereas intra-cerebellar tracts develop more slowly. Neonatal females exhibit faster overall FA development than males. Although preterm neonates show lower overall FA development rates, they demonstrate relatively higher FA growth in specific tracts, including the corticospinal tract, corona radiata-pontine pathway, and intracerebellar tracts. These findings demonstrate that NABA is a useful tool for investigating WM development across neonates and adults.

### [5] [PHANTOM: PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing Connected Vehicle Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19711)
*Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo,Moinul Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHANTOM是一种利用变形艺术制作视角依赖对抗样本的框架，针对自动驾驶车辆视觉系统，能在黑盒设置下实现高成功率攻击，并引发V2X网络级连锁反应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自动驾驶车辆依赖视觉DNN和V2X通信，但这些系统仍易受物理对抗攻击。现有攻击方法存在局限性，需要一种能在实际场景中有效且具有网络级影响的攻击框架。

Method: 采用变形艺术原理，制作几何扭曲的对抗样本，这些扭曲对人类看起来自然但对目标检测器会产生误判。在黑盒设置下工作，无需模型访问，通过视角依赖特性实现攻击。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中，PHANTOM在最优条件下攻击成功率超过90%，在恶劣环境下仍保持60-80%效果。攻击在6-10米内激活，来不及安全规避。V2X模拟显示虚假紧急消息传播使信息峰值年龄增加68-89%，严重破坏安全通信。

Conclusion: PHANTOM框架揭示了CAV生态系统在感知和通信层的严重漏洞，这些攻击不仅欺骗单个车辆，还能引发网络级连锁反应，威胁整个自动驾驶系统的安全性。

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and low-latency (Vehicle-to-Everything) V2X communication to navigate safely and efficiently. Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.

TL;DR: 利用预训练视频扩散模型从单张运动模糊图像恢复拍摄时刻及前后时间段的完整视频序列


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动模糊图像虽然损失细节，但编码了场景和相机运动信息。现有方法依赖手工先验或特定网络架构，难以恢复复杂场景动态，且无法推断拍摄前后发生的事件。

Method: 利用在互联网规模数据集上预训练的视频扩散模型，从单张运动模糊图像恢复揭示拍摄时刻及前后复杂场景动态的视频序列。

Result: 方法鲁棒且通用，优于现有技术，能处理野外挑战性图像，支持恢复相机轨迹、物体运动和动态3D场景结构等下游任务。

Conclusion: 通过重新利用预训练视频扩散模型，成功从运动模糊图像恢复复杂场景动态和时序信息，为运动模糊分析开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We seek to answer the question: what can a motion-blurred image reveal about a scene's past, present, and future? Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动对焦系统经常无法准确捕捉目标主体，用户希望在拍摄后调整对焦，但现有方法效果有限

Method: 使用视频扩散模型从单张模糊图像生成感知准确的对焦堆栈（视频序列），并发布大规模真实智能手机拍摄的对焦堆栈数据集

Result: 在感知质量和鲁棒性方面持续优于现有方法，支持交互式重聚焦和各种下游应用

Conclusion: 该方法为日常摄影中更先进的对焦编辑功能铺平了道路，代码和数据已开源

Abstract: Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography.

### [8] [RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19850)
*A. Shekhovtsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文重新审视了几何模型拟合中的评分函数，分析了MAGSAC++的推导问题，并提出了评分函数评估方法，发现现有方法性能相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视RANSAC中几何模型拟合的评分函数问题，特别是分析当前最佳方法MAGSAC++的理论基础，并提出系统的评估方法。

Method: 1. 将几何误差扩展到球形噪声；2. 在鲁棒设置中考虑均匀分布异常值的混合模型；3. 分析MAGSAC++的推导问题；4. 提出基于大验证集或小随机验证集的评分函数评估方法。

Result: 1. 发现MAGSAC++的推导不符合合理原则，其评分函数在数值上等价于简单的高斯-均匀似然；2. 所有评分函数（包括使用学习的内点分布）性能相同；3. MAGSAC++既不优于简单竞争者，也不对阈值超参数选择更不敏感。

Conclusion: 全面重新审视了最先进的方法，这对未来改进方法或将其应用于其他鲁棒拟合问题的研究至关重要。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGE-Occ提出了一种用于3D全景占据预测的新框架，通过混合视图变换分支结合3D高斯和边缘先验，提升几何一致性和边界感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保持精确几何结构和捕捉3D实例空间范围方面存在困难，这影响了全景分离的鲁棒性。需要改进几何一致性和边界感知来实现细粒度的3D场景理解。

Method: 采用混合视图变换分支，融合连续高斯深度表示和离散深度仓表示，生成具有改进几何一致性的BEV特征。同时从BEV特征提取边缘图作为辅助信息学习边缘线索。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes数据集上的广泛实验表明，HyGE-Occ优于现有方法，展现出卓越的3D几何推理能力。

Conclusion: HyGE-Occ通过结合高斯深度表示和边缘先验，有效提升了3D全景占据预测的几何一致性和边界感知，为细粒度3D场景理解提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Widget-to-Code任务，针对紧凑型小部件UI生成代码，建立首个图像基准，开发WidgetFactory系统提升视觉保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UI2Code研究主要关注网页和移动界面，而小部件（widgets）作为紧凑、无上下文、图标密集的微界面缺乏研究。小部件设计通常是专有的，缺乏可访问的标记数据。

Method: 1) 建立首个图像小部件基准，包含细粒度多维评估指标；2) 开发WidgetFactory系统：基于小部件设计原则组装原子组件，包含图标检索和可重用可视化模块；3) 设计框架无关的小部件特定领域语言WidgetDSL；4) 开发编译器将WidgetDSL转换为多种前端实现；5) 自适应渲染模块优化空间布局满足紧凑性约束。

Result: 基准测试显示通用多模态大语言模型优于专用UI2Code方法，但仍产生不可靠和视觉不一致的代码。提出的WidgetFactory系统显著提升了视觉保真度，为Widget2Code研究建立了强基准和统一基础设施。

Conclusion: Widget2Code是一个具有挑战性的新任务，需要专门的方法来处理小部件的紧凑性和图标密集特性。提出的WidgetFactory系统通过联合推进感知理解和结构化代码生成，为未来研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

TL;DR: NeurAlign：一种深度学习框架，通过统一的体积-表面表示联合配准3D脑MRI图像，在球坐标空间中实现皮层和皮层下区域的一致对齐，显著提高配准精度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将体积和表面配准分开处理，导致不一致性，限制了神经科学研究的跨被试分析。需要一种能够同时对齐皮层和皮层下区域的一致方法。

Method: 提出NeurAlign深度学习框架，使用中间球坐标空间桥接解剖表面拓扑和体积解剖结构。通过集成球面配准到学习中，确保体积和表面域之间的几何一致性。

Result: 在域内和域外数据集上，NeurAlign始终优于传统和基于机器学习的配准方法，将Dice分数提高了最多7个点，同时保持规则变形场。推理速度比标准方法快几个数量级。

Conclusion: NeurAlign以其卓越的准确性、快速推理和易用性，为联合皮层和皮层下配准设定了新标准，仅需MRI扫描作为输入，无需额外输入。

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

TL;DR: VehicleMAE-V2是一个面向车辆感知的预训练大模型，通过整合车辆对称性、轮廓和语义三种结构化先验知识来增强掩码令牌重建，在五个下游任务上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预训练阶段缺乏对车辆相关知识的有效学习，导致车辆感知表示建模能力不足。需要开发能够学习通用车辆感知表示的预训练模型。

Method: 提出VehicleMAE-V2模型，设计了三个模块：SMM利用车辆对称性约束选择高质量掩码图像块；CRM通过最小化轮廓特征与重建特征的概率分布差异来保持车辆结构信息；SRM通过对比学习和跨模态蒸馏对齐图像-文本特征。使用包含400万车辆图像和12,693文本描述的Autobot4M数据集进行预训练。

Result: 在五个下游任务上的广泛实验证明了VehicleMAE-V2的优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过整合车辆相关的多模态结构化先验知识来指导掩码令牌重建过程，能够显著增强模型学习通用车辆感知表示的能力。

Abstract: Vehicle-centric perception plays a crucial role in many intelligent systems, including large-scale surveillance systems, intelligent transportation, and autonomous driving. Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2.

Motivation: 尽管 Vision Transformers 已成为标准视觉骨干网络，但缺乏对其计算现象学的机制性解释。需要建立框架将 Transformer 深度解释为特征良好的动力学流

Method: 提出块循环假设(BRH)，认为训练好的 ViTs 具有块循环深度结构。训练块循环代理模型 Raptor，通过层间表示相似性矩阵分析，并开发动力学可解释性程序

Result: 实验证明：1)随机深度和训练促进循环结构；2)Raptor 仅用2个块即可恢复 DINOv2 96%的线性探测准确率；3)发现方向收敛、令牌特定动力学和低秩更新等动力学特征

Conclusion: ViT 深度中出现了紧凑的循环程序，指向低复杂度规范解，使这些模型能够通过原理性动力学系统分析进行研究

Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SE360：用于360°全景图多条件引导对象编辑的新框架，通过粗到细的自主数据生成和两阶段数据精炼策略，训练基于Transformer的扩散模型实现文本、掩码或参考图像引导的灵活编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于指令的图像编辑方法扩展到360°全景图时面临挑战，在等距柱状投影和透视视图中常产生不合理结果，需要专门针对全景图编辑的解决方案。

Method: 1. 提出粗到细的自主数据生成流水线，利用视觉语言模型和自适应投影调整进行分层分析；2. 引入两阶段数据精炼策略提升数据真实性和减少擦除伪影；3. 基于构建的数据集训练基于Transformer的扩散模型。

Result: 实验表明该方法在视觉质量和语义准确性方面优于现有方法，能够实现文本、掩码或参考图像引导的灵活对象编辑。

Conclusion: SE360框架有效解决了360°全景图编辑的挑战，通过创新的数据生成和精炼策略，实现了高质量、语义准确的全景图对象编辑。

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

Motivation: 全切片图像的高通量"病理组学"分析为研究组织特征和生物标志物发现提供了新机会，但缺乏能够测量个体结构特征空间相互作用及其与临床参数关联的工具，限制了微环境和宏观环境层面组织特征的临床相关性。

Method: 1. 特征空间：在传统指标基础上增加30个来自地理信息系统点模式分析的拓扑和空间特征，以量化组织微结构；2. 关联研究引擎：受表型全关联研究启发，对每个特征进行大规模单变量回归并进行统计校正。

Conclusion: HistoWAS提供了一个计算框架，能够将组织空间组织与临床结果关联起来，代码和数据已开源，有助于病理组学分析和生物标志物发现。

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法忽视病理图像中实例间的复杂语义关系，Transformer方法虽能建模实例依赖但计算复杂度高，且固定尺度注意力机制难以捕捉不同肿瘤区域的尺度变化和距离衰减效应。

Method: 提出WSD-MIL：1) 窗口尺度衰减注意力模块，采用聚类采样降低计算成本，通过渐进衰减窗口尺度捕捉多尺度局部关系；2) 基于挤压激励的区域门控模块，动态调整窗口权重以增强全局信息建模。

Result: 在CAMELYON16和TCGA-BRCA数据集上达到最先进性能，同时减少62%的计算内存消耗。

Conclusion: WSD-MIL有效解决了病理图像中多尺度肿瘤区域建模和计算效率问题，为大规模WSI分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the integration of pre-trained foundational models with multiple instance learning (MIL) has improved diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology. However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨分辨率土地覆盖制图需要从粗分辨率监督中生成高分辨率预测，但分辨率严重不匹配导致现有弱监督方法难以对齐精细空间结构与粗标签，造成噪声监督和制图精度下降。

Method: 提出DDTM双分支弱监督框架：1）扩散分支在粗监督下逐步细化细尺度局部语义；2）Transformer分支强制执行大空间范围内的长距离上下文一致性；3）伪标签置信度评估模块减轻跨分辨率不一致性带来的噪声，选择性利用可靠监督信号。

Result: 在Chesapeake Bay基准测试中达到66.52% mIoU，显著优于现有弱监督方法，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DDTM通过解耦局部语义细化和全局上下文推理，有效解决了跨分辨率土地覆盖制图中的监督不匹配问题，为弱监督遥感图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像动画生成中存在两个主要问题：1) 视频信号高维度导致训练数据稀缺，模型倾向于记忆而非遵循提示生成运动；2) 难以泛化到训练集中未见过的新运动模式，且使用有限数据微调的研究不足

Method: 提出模块化图像到视频适配器(MIVA)，这是一种可附加到预训练扩散模型的轻量子网络，每个模块设计用于捕获单一运动模式，支持并行扩展。仅需约10个样本即可在消费级GPU上高效训练

Result: 实验表明MIVA能够实现更精确的运动控制，同时保持甚至超越在大规模数据集上训练模型的生成质量

Conclusion: MIVA通过模块化设计解决了扩散模型在图像动画中的局限性，实现了高效训练和精确运动控制，无需复杂的提示工程

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved impressive photorealism in image and video generation. However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization. MIVAs can be efficiently trained on approximately ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU. At inference time, users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs, eliminating the need for prompt engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining, or even surpassing, the generation quality of models trained on significantly larger datasets.

Abstract: Automated pavement defect detection often struggles to generalize across diverse real-world conditions due to the lack of standardized datasets. Existing datasets differ in annotation styles, distress type definitions, and formats, limiting their integration for unified training. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark dataset that consolidates multiple publicly available sources into a standardized collection of 52747 images from seven countries, with 135277 bounding box annotations covering 13 distinct distress types. The dataset captures broad real-world variation in image quality, resolution, viewing angles, and weather conditions, offering a unique resource for consistent training and evaluation. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through benchmarking with state-of-the-art object detection models including YOLOv8-YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, and DETR, which achieved competitive performance across diverse scenarios. By standardizing class definitions and annotation formats, this dataset provides the first globally representative benchmark for pavement defect detection and enables fair comparison of models, including zero-shot transfer to new environments.

Conclusion: 通过LaSeRS数据集和SegEarth-R2模型，解决了遥感图像中复杂语言引导分割的关键挑战，填补了现有研究的空白，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation. All data and code will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-R2.

TL;DR: 双视角（驾驶员+道路）输入在某些架构中能提升分心驾驶检测准确率，但并非所有模型都受益，架构设计对多视角融合效果至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分心驾驶检测模型主要依赖驾驶员视角，忽略了影响驾驶行为的关键环境上下文。本研究探讨结合道路视角是否能提升自然驾驶条件下的检测准确性。

Method: 使用真实驾驶的双摄像头同步录像，对三种时空动作识别架构（SlowFast-R50、X3D-M、SlowOnly-R50）进行基准测试，比较单视角（驾驶员）和双视角（驾驶员+道路堆叠）两种输入配置。

Result: SlowOnly-R50模型使用双视角输入时准确率提升9.8%，而SlowFast-R50模型准确率下降7.2%，X3D-M模型表现居中。结果表明上下文输入的效果强烈依赖于底层架构。

Conclusion: 简单地添加视觉上下文并不足够，可能导致干扰，除非架构专门设计用于支持多视角融合。未来多模态驾驶员监控系统需要融合感知设计。

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

Motivation: 当前基于单一静态图的图神经网络在多模态医疗诊断中效果受限，无法建模患者特定的病理关系，需要更灵活的动态图构建方法。

Method: 提出MAPI-GNN框架：1) 通过多维判别器发现潜在图感知模式；2) 基于这些模式动态构建激活图堆栈；3) 通过关系融合引擎聚合多面图配置文件进行诊断。

Result: 在两个不同任务（超过1300个患者样本）上的实验表明，MAPI-GNN显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MAPI-GNN通过从语义解缠特征子空间学习多面图配置文件，有效解决了单一静态图的局限性，为多模态医疗诊断提供了更强大的关系建模能力。

Abstract: Graph neural networks are increasingly applied to multimodal medical diagnosis for their inherent relational modeling capabilities. However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: H2em：通过双曲几何嵌入层次结构，提升组合零样本学习性能的新框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CZSL方法忽略了丰富的层次结构（如语义层次和概念层次），且欧几里得空间的多项式体积增长无法匹配层次结构的指数增长，限制了大规模分类下的泛化能力。

Method: 提出H2em框架，利用双曲几何嵌入树状结构；设计双重层次蕴含损失（使用双曲蕴含锥强制层次关系）和判别对齐损失（通过难负样本挖掘增大语义相似组合间的测地距离）；开发双曲跨模态注意力机制实现实例感知的跨模态融合。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的广泛消融实验表明，H2em在封闭世界和开放世界场景中都达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 双曲几何能有效建模CZSL中的层次结构，H2em框架通过精心设计的损失函数和注意力机制，显著提升了组合零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

Method: 1）两阶段框架：共享视频编码器+双解码器，联合预测汉字序列和标准拼音；2）推理时生成多个候选转录，将拼音输出与候选汉字拼接作为提示，输入大语言模型进行消歧；3）在大语言模型上使用合成噪声数据进行微调，使其了解模型特定的错误模式。

Result: 通过结合视觉特征、语音信息和语言上下文，VALLR-Pin提升了中文唇语识别的性能。多任务学习和LLM消歧机制有效解决了同音字和视觉模糊问题。

Conclusion: VALLR-Pin通过将视觉特征与语音和语言上下文相结合，为中文唇语识别提供了一个有效的解决方案，特别针对中文特有的同音字和视觉模糊问题进行了优化。

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

TL;DR: FlashLips是一个两阶段、无需掩码的唇部同步系统，通过解耦唇部控制与渲染，在单GPU上实现超过100FPS的实时性能，同时达到最先进大模型的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有唇部同步系统通常需要复杂的掩码处理或依赖GAN/扩散模型，导致计算开销大、推理速度慢。需要一种既能保持高质量视觉效果，又能实现实时性能的简化方案。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：第一阶段是紧凑的一步潜在空间编辑器，使用参考身份、掩码目标帧和低维唇部姿态向量重建图像，仅用重建损失训练（无GAN/扩散）。通过自监督生成嘴部变体作为伪真值进行微调，实现无掩码推理。第二阶段是基于流匹配目标的音频到姿态变换器，从语音预测唇部姿态向量。

Result: 系统在单GPU上实现超过100FPS的实时性能，匹配最先进大模型的视觉质量。结合确定性重建与鲁棒的音频控制，形成简单稳定的流水线。

Conclusion: FlashLips通过解耦唇部控制与渲染、采用自监督消除显式掩码需求，实现了高质量唇部同步的实时性能，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present FlashLips, a two-stage, mask-free lip-sync system that decouples lips control from rendering and achieves real-time performance running at over 100 FPS on a single GPU, while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech. Together, these stages form a simple and stable pipeline that combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control, delivering high perceptual quality and faster-than-real-time speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像描述通常缺乏上下文深度，省略了事件背景、时间线索、结果和命名实体等关键细节，限制了在新闻、教育和数字档案等领域的应用效果

Method: 使用BEIT-3和SigLIP检索语义相似图像，通过ORB和SIFT进行几何对齐重排序，从相关文章中提取上下文信息，最后用QLoRA微调的Qwen3模型整合基础描述生成事件丰富的上下文感知描述

Result: 在OpenEvents v1数据集上评估，相比传统方法生成了显著更丰富的信息性描述，显示出在需要深度视觉-文本理解的实际应用中的强大潜力

Conclusion: 提出的多模态管道通过整合外部文本知识有效增强了图像描述的上下文深度，为需要丰富信息描述的实际应用提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding

Motivation: 现有学习图像编码器已从人类感知扩展到机器感知，但针对机器感知的渐进式图像压缩（具有细粒度可扩展性）尚未探索。需要开发支持多质量级别解码的机器感知压缩方法。

Method: 基于三态平面编码构建PICM-Net，分析人类与机器感知在率失真优先级上的差异，系统研究机器感知编码器的潜在优先级策略。设计自适应解码控制器，在推理时动态确定必要的解码级别以维持下游机器预测的置信度。

Conclusion: PICM-Net成功填补了机器感知渐进式图像压缩的空白，通过三态平面编码和自适应解码控制器实现了高效、自适应的渐进传输，为机器感知压缩提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

TL;DR: 提出IRSN网络，通过分析单品区域特征及其组合来改进时尚风格分类，在多个数据集上显著提升分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚风格分类具有挑战性，因为同一风格内视觉差异大，且不同风格间视觉相似度高。风格不仅由整体外观表达，还由单品属性及其组合决定。

Method: 提出IRSN网络：1) 使用IRP提取单品区域特征；2) 分别分析各区域特征；3) 使用GFF融合特征；4) 采用双骨干架构结合领域特定特征提取器和预训练通用特征提取器。

Result: 在6个骨干网络上应用IRSN，在FashionStyle14数据集上平均提升6.9%，最高提升14.5%；在ShowniqV3数据集上平均提升7.6%，最高提升15.1%。可视化分析显示IRSN能更好区分相似风格。

Conclusion: IRSN通过分析单品区域特征及其组合，有效提升了时尚风格分类性能，特别是在区分视觉相似风格方面表现优异。

Abstract: Fashion style classification is a challenging task because of the large visual variation within the same style and the existence of visually similar styles.
  Styles are expressed not only by the global appearance, but also by the attributes of individual items and their combinations.
  In this study, we propose an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN) to effectively classify fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations in addition to global features.
  IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF).
  In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset.
  In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset. Visualization analysis also supports that the IRSN models are better than the baseline models at capturing differences between similar style classes.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了激活函数和优化器组合对基于深度学习的HAR系统性能的影响，发现ConvLSTM结合Adam或RMSprop在医疗活动识别中表现最佳，准确率可达99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在HAR中广泛应用，但激活函数和优化器的组合对性能的影响尚未充分研究，特别是在实际医疗场景中。现有研究多关注架构设计，而AF与MO的交互作用相对未被探索。

Method: 研究使用三种激活函数（ReLU、Sigmoid、Tanh）与四种优化算法（SGD、Adam、RMSprop、Adagrad）的组合，在两种循环架构（BiLSTM和ConvLSTM）上进行实验。实验基于HMDB51和UCF101数据集中六个医疗相关活动类别。

Result: ConvLSTM在所有数据集上均优于BiLSTM。ConvLSTM结合Adam或RMSprop达到99%准确率，表现出强大的时空学习能力和稳定性能。BiLSTM在UCF101上表现尚可（约98%），但在HMDB51上降至约60%，显示其跨数据集鲁棒性有限且对AF和MO变化不敏感。

Conclusion: 该研究为优化HAR系统提供了实用见解，特别是在需要快速精确活动检测的现实医疗环境中。ConvLSTM结合Adam或RMSprop是实现高性能HAR系统的推荐配置。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在实现高质量LiDAR点云生成的同时保持灵活可控性，主要因为复杂点云分布与简单控制信号之间的不平衡问题

Method: 将文本、图像和点云统一表示为3D布局，转换为语义和深度控制信号，然后使用基于rangemap的ControlNet指导LiDAR点云生成

Result: 实现了像素级对齐的可控LiDAR点云生成，支持从任意文本描述、图像和草图创建自动驾驶环境

Conclusion: LiDARDraft通过3D布局桥接多种控制信号与LiDAR点云，实现了高质量、多样化的可控生成，为自动驾驶仿真提供了"从零开始模拟"的能力

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

Conclusion: 提出的混合框架成功结合了确定性渲染和随机生成的优势，实现了快速且高质量的3D场景新视角合成，无需手工设计的3D归纳偏置，具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to render photorealistic, 3D-consistent images of a scene from unseen camera poses given only a sparse set of posed views. Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines.

TL;DR: 多模态注意力网络融合雷达时间模式与热成像空间特征，用于桥梁板分层检测，引入不确定性量化，在平衡数据上优于基线方法，但极端类别不平衡下注意力机制易崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础设施检测技术存在局限性：探地雷达对湿度和浅层缺陷敏感，热成像受天气影响且探测深度有限。单模态方法存在互补约束，需要融合多模态数据以克服各自缺陷。

Method: 提出多模态注意力网络，包含：1) 雷达时间注意力处理时间模式；2) 热成像空间注意力提取空间特征；3) 跨模态融合通过可学习嵌入发现互补缺陷模式；4) 不确定性量化采用蒙特卡洛dropout和方差估计，分解为认知和偶然不确定性。

Result: 在五个桥梁数据集上，平衡到中度不平衡数据中，该方法在准确率和AUC上显著优于基线（单模态和简单拼接融合）。跨模态注意力比单模态注意力提供关键增益，多头机制改善校准。不确定性量化降低校准误差，支持选择性预测。但极端类别不平衡下注意力机制易出现多数类崩溃。

Conclusion: 基于注意力的架构在典型场景下表现良好，但极端不平衡需要专门技术。系统保持部署效率，支持实时检测，并提供了能力与局限性的明确特征。

Abstract: Deteriorating civil infrastructure requires automated inspection techniques overcoming limitations of visual assessment. While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

Motivation: 现有音频-视觉分割方法存在多源纠缠和视听错位问题，导致偏向更大或更响的物体，而忽略较弱、较小或共现的声源。

Method: DDAVS使用可学习查询提取音频语义，通过音频原型记忆库构建结构化语义空间，采用对比学习优化；引入延迟模态交互的双重交叉注意力机制缓解视听错位。

Result: 在AVS-Objects和VPO基准测试中，DDAVS在单源、多源和多实例场景下均优于现有方法，表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DDAVS通过解耦音频语义和延迟双向对齐，有效解决了音频-视觉分割中的关键挑战，在真实复杂场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

TL;DR: HEART-ViT：首个基于Hessian指导的统一动态注意力与token剪枝框架，通过二阶曲率加权敏感性分析，在保持准确率的同时显著降低ViT计算开销和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers (ViTs) 虽然精度高，但二次注意力成本和冗余计算严重阻碍在延迟和资源受限平台上的部署。现有剪枝方法单独处理token或注意力头，依赖启发式或一阶信号，往往牺牲精度或无法跨输入泛化。

Method: 提出HEART-ViT框架，使用高效的Hessian-vector乘积估计token和注意力头的曲率加权敏感性，在明确损失预算下进行原则性剪枝决策。该双视角敏感性分析揭示：token剪枝主导计算节省，而注意力头剪枝提供细粒度冗余消除，两者结合实现优越权衡。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和ImageNet-1K上，ViT-B/16和DeiT-B/16模型实现高达49.4% FLOPs减少、36%延迟降低和46%吞吐量提升，同时微调后保持或超越基线精度（如40% token剪枝时恢复4.7%精度）。在AGX Orin等边缘设备上部署验证了实际推理速度和能效提升。

Conclusion: HEART-ViT填补了理论与实践的差距，提供了首个统一、曲率驱动的剪枝框架，既保持精度又适合边缘部署，为ViT在资源受限平台上的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园自动化任务面临环境变化大、遮挡严重等挑战，苹果姿态估计中关键点（如花萼）常被遮挡。现有方法虽不依赖这些关键点，但仍需它们进行标注，导致标注困难耗时。遮挡还会造成同一水果在不同图像中的标注冲突或缺失。

Method: 提出新颖流程：1）使用3D高斯泼溅重建果园场景；2）简化标注过程；3）自动将标注投影到图像；4）训练和评估姿态估计方法。仅需105个手动标注即可获得28,191个训练标签。

Result: 使用遮挡≤95%的水果标签训练时性能最佳，原始图像F1分数0.927，渲染图像0.970。训练集大小调整对F1分数和姿态估计精度影响较小。遮挡最少的水果位置估计最好，遮挡增加时性能下降。测试的姿态估计方法未能正确学习苹果方向估计。

Conclusion: 提出的3D重建标注流程能大幅减少手动标注工作量（减少99.6%），有效解决果园环境中遮挡导致的标注难题，为自动化果园任务提供了高效的数据标注解决方案。

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

*Grega Šuštar,Jer Pelhan,Alan Lukežič,Matej Kristan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDi是首个基于潜在扩散模型的低样本目标计数方法，通过生成高质量密度图来精确定位目标位置，在FSC和MCAC基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低样本计数方法存在局限性：基于密度的方法定位能力差，而基于点检测的方法在目标数量大时性能下降，需要采用上采样和分块等临时技术。需要一种既能准确计数又能精确定位的方法。

Method: 提出CoDi，首个基于潜在扩散模型的低样本计数器，通过新的基于示例的条件模块提取和调整目标原型到去噪网络的中间层，生成高质量密度图，通过非极大值抑制确定目标位置。

Result: 在FSC基准测试中，CoDi在少样本、单样本和无参考场景下分别比最先进方法提升15%、13%和10%的MAE；在MCAC基准测试中，比顶级方法提升44%的MAE，创下新纪录。

Conclusion: CoDi通过扩散模型生成高质量密度图，实现了准确的目标计数和定位，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，为低样本目标计数提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-shot object counting addresses estimating the number of previously unobserved objects in an image using only few or no annotated test-time exemplars. A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档图像检索方法主要基于图像查询，只能检索粗粒度语义类别（如报纸或收据），无法有效处理现实场景中提供的具有细粒度语义的文本查询。

Method: 1) 构建NL-DIR数据集：41K真实文档图像，每个图像配对5个高质量细粒度语义查询（使用大语言模型生成并人工验证）；2) 评估现有主流对比视觉语言模型和OCR-free视觉文档理解模型；3) 研究两阶段检索方法以提高性能同时保证时空效率。

Result: 提出了新的NL-DIR基准测试和相应评估指标，数据集和代码将在huggingface上公开，为零样本和微调评估提供了基础。

Conclusion: NL-DIR基准测试为视觉文档理解社区带来新机遇，促进基于自然语言的细粒度文档图像检索研究。

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community. Datasets and codes will be publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/nianbing/NL-DIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像压缩方法在像素空间进行变换编码以减少空间冗余，但在低比特率下难以同时实现高真实感和高保真度，因为像素空间失真可能与人类感知不一致。

Method: 1. 在生成式VQ-VAE的潜在空间进行变换编码，该空间具有更好的稀疏性、语义丰富性和感知对齐性；2. 引入分类超模块降低超信息比特成本；3. 使用基于码字预测的监督增强语义一致性。

Result: 1. 在自然图像上实现小于0.04 bpp，人脸图像上小于0.01 bpp的高视觉质量；2. 在CLIC2020测试集上，以比MS-ILLM少45%的比特数达到相同FID；3. 支持图像修复和风格迁移等应用。

Conclusion: GLC通过在生成式潜在空间而非像素空间进行编码，解决了低比特率下高真实感与高保真度的平衡问题，为高质量图像压缩和相关应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer.

TL;DR: 提出JDPNet网络，通过挖掘耦合退化中的潜在信息，在统一框架中处理水下图像的多重非线性耦合退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像存在多种退化类型，这些退化呈现非线性耦合而非简单叠加，现有方法多为特定退化设计特定分支或模块，难以有效捕捉和处理多重退化的非线性交互作用。

Method: 提出JDPNet网络，包含联合特征挖掘模块和概率引导分布策略，用于挖掘和统一调整耦合退化特征；设计AquaBalanceLoss损失函数平衡颜色、清晰度和对比度。

Result: 在六个公开水下数据集和两个新构建数据集上的实验表明，JDPNet在性能、参数量和计算成本之间取得更好平衡，表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: JDPNet通过挖掘耦合退化中的潜在信息，在统一框架中有效处理水下图像的多重非线性耦合退化问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Given the complexity of underwater environments and the variability of water as a medium, underwater images are inevitably subject to various types of degradation. The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.

TL;DR: 提出D³ETOR框架，通过辩论增强的伪标签和频率感知渐进去偏，显著提升弱监督伪装目标检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WSCOD方法性能远落后于全监督方法，主要因为：1) 通用分割模型生成的伪标签不可靠，缺乏COD任务特定语义理解；2) 忽视涂鸦标注的固有偏差，阻碍模型捕捉伪装目标的全局结构

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段采用自适应熵驱动点采样和多智能体辩论机制增强SAM的COD能力；第二阶段设计FADeNet，渐进融合多级频率感知特征，动态重加权监督强度以缓解涂鸦偏差

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著缩小了弱监督与全监督COD之间的差距

Conclusion: D³ETOR通过联合利用伪标签和涂鸦语义的监督信号，有效解决了WSCOD中的关键挑战，为弱监督伪装目标检测提供了新思路

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: LiteFusion是一种新颖的多模态3D检测器，将LiDAR数据作为几何信息补充增强相机检测，完全消除对3D骨干网络的依赖，提高部署友好性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态3D检测器过度依赖LiDAR传感器，在LiDAR缺失时性能大幅下降，且依赖3D稀疏卷积算子难以在不同硬件平台（如NPU、FPGA）上部署，限制了自动驾驶系统的实用性和安全性。

Method: LiteFusion将LiDAR点云作为几何信息补充源而非独立模态，在四元数空间中集成LiDAR点到图像特征中，保持正交约束以建模跨模态领域特定关系，生成紧凑的跨模态嵌入，完全避免使用3D骨干网络。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，LiteFusion将基线视觉检测器的mAP提升20.4%，NDS提升19.7%，仅增加1.1%参数且不使用专用LiDAR编码器。即使在LiDAR输入缺失时仍能保持良好性能。

Conclusion: LiteFusion通过重新思考LiDAR在相机-LiDAR融合中的作用，提供了一种部署友好、鲁棒性强的多模态3D检测方案，能在不同硬件平台和传感器配置下保持良好性能。

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像领域广泛应用，但复杂模型（如ResNets、Vision Transformers）的解释性较差。SHAP作为主流解释方法，在存在认知和随机不确定性时，其解释可能不稳定不可靠。医学影像应用中存在图像质量、分辨率、模态类型等噪声，引入显著认知不确定性，需要量化SHAP解释的不确定性。

Method: 使用Dirichlet后验采样和Dempster-Shafer理论来量化SHAP解释的不确定性。框架采用信念图、似然图和融合图方法，结合统计定量分析，对SHAP解释的不确定性进行量化。

Result: 在三个医学影像数据集上评估了该框架，这些数据集具有不同的类别分布、图像质量和模态类型（涵盖病理学、眼科学和放射学），引入了显著的认知不确定性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效量化医学影像应用中SHAP解释的不确定性，为领域专家提供更可靠、可解释的模型预测理解。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

<details>

Motivation: 现有文档布局数据集存在三个主要问题：1）大规模数据集（如PubLayNet、DocBank）缺乏细粒度区域标签和多语言多样性；2）人工标注数据集（如M6Doc、D4LA）标签丰富但规模太小且多语言覆盖不足；3）印度语言文档在现有数据集中代表性严重不足，限制了文档理解技术的发展。

Method: 构建IndicDLP数据集，涵盖11种代表性印度语言和英语，覆盖12个常见文档领域。同时创建UED-mini数据集（基于DocLayNet和M6Doc）用于预训练。通过微调现有英语模型在IndicDLP上的实验验证其有效性。

Result: 在IndicDLP上微调现有英语模型显著提升了性能，验证了数据集的有效性。更重要的是，在IndicDLP上训练的模型能够很好地泛化到非印度语言布局，表明该数据集对文档数字化具有广泛价值。

Conclusion: IndicDLP填补了文档布局分析在规模、多样性和标注粒度方面的空白，推动了包容性和高效的文档理解技术发展，特别为多语言文档数字化提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.

Method: 设计空间-光谱退化度量连续量化多维退化作为退化提示；引入空间-光谱自适应模块动态调制特征提取；将SSAM作为专家集成到混合专家架构，用DP作为门控路由器

Conclusion: DAMP框架通过退化感知度量提示，无需显式退化先验，实现了对多样、混合或未见退化的自适应、高效、鲁棒恢复

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的第一人称视角视频与可穿戴传感器对齐方法存在用户不适、隐私问题和可扩展性限制。外中心视角视频与环境传感器提供了非侵入性、可扩展的替代方案，但全局对齐方法无法捕捉局部细节，且容易因共享相似时间模式但不同空间语义上下文而导致误对齐。

Method: 提出DETACH框架：1）显式分解时空特征以保留局部细节；2）通过在线聚类发现传感器-空间特征，为上下文感知对齐提供语义基础；3）两阶段对齐：通过相互监督建立空间对应，然后通过空间-时间加权对比损失进行时间对齐，自适应处理简单负样本、困难负样本和假负样本。

Result: 在Opportunity++和HWU-USP数据集的下游任务实验中，相比适应性的第一人称视角-可穿戴传感器基线方法，DETACH取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: DETACH通过分解的时空框架有效解决了外中心视角-环境传感器对齐中的关键问题，为非侵入性、可扩展的人类动作识别提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像语义分割面临类间相似度高、类内差异大的挑战，现有方法难以将抽象且具有强判别性的语义知识有效注入像素级特征学习，导致复杂场景中边界模糊和类别混淆。

Method: 提出BiCoR-Seg框架：1) 设计热图驱动的双向信息协同模块(HBIS)，通过生成类别级热图在特征图和类别嵌入之间建立双向信息流；2) 引入分层监督策略，将每个HBIS模块生成的可解释热图直接用作低分辨率分割预测进行监督；3) 提出跨层类别嵌入Fisher判别损失，增强类内紧凑性和类间分离性。

Result: 在LoveDA、Vaihingen和Potsdam数据集上的大量实验表明，BiCoR-Seg实现了出色的分割性能，同时提供了更强的可解释性。

Conclusion: BiCoR-Seg通过双向协同细化和分层监督有效解决了高分辨率遥感图像语义分割的挑战，在提升分割精度的同时增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了仿真环境中模仿学习的性能限制，发现专家与学生模型之间的不对齐（如视野差异、不确定性差异、导航意图不明确）是主要瓶颈，并提出改进方法使TransFuser v6在CARLA基准测试中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仿真器能生成无限驾驶数据，但模仿学习策略在仿真中仍难以实现鲁棒的闭环性能。作者发现特权专家演示与基于传感器的学生观察之间的不对齐限制了模仿学习效果，包括专家视野更广（忽略遮挡）、不确定性更低（知道其他车辆动作），以及学生模型中导航意图不明确。

Method: 通过缩小专家与学生之间的差距进行改进：1）解决视野不对称问题；2）降低不确定性差异；3）明确导航意图规范。开发了TransFuser v6（TFv6）学生策略，并在共享的仿真到真实管道中集成感知监督。

Result: TFv6在CARLA所有主要公开闭环基准测试中达到新SOTA：Bench2Drive上95 DS，Longest6~v2和Town13上性能翻倍。在NAVSIM和Waymo视觉端到端驾驶基准测试中也显示出一致增益。

Conclusion: 专家与学生模型之间的不对齐显著限制了模仿学习性能，通过针对性改进可以缩小这些差距，实现显著的性能提升。该方法在多个基准测试中验证有效，代码、数据和模型已开源。

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead.

TL;DR: LADLE-MM是一个轻量级多模态虚假信息检测器，在有限标注数据和计算资源下，通过模型集成和固定参考空间实现高效检测，性能优于更复杂的现有方法。


<details>

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

TL;DR: KeyTailor：基于关键帧细节注入的扩散Transformer视频虚拟试穿框架，配合高质量数据集ViT-HD，在保持背景完整性和服装动态细节方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散Transformer的视频虚拟试穿方法存在三个主要问题：1）难以捕捉细粒度服装动态；2）难以保持视频帧间的背景完整性；3）因引入额外交互模块导致计算成本高；4）现有公开数据集规模和质量有限限制了模型泛化能力。

Result: KeyTailor在动态和静态场景下，在服装保真度和背景完整性方面均优于现有最先进基线方法。同时发布了包含15,070个高质量视频样本（分辨率810*1080）的ViT-HD数据集。

Conclusion: KeyTailor通过关键帧驱动的细节注入策略，有效解决了视频虚拟试穿中的服装动态捕捉和背景一致性问题，同时避免了额外的计算复杂度。配合高质量数据集ViT-HD，为视频虚拟试穿任务提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

TL;DR: CRAFT是一个无需训练、模型无关的框架，通过结构化推理和多轮验证来提升文本到图像生成的质量，特别适合轻量级生成器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时优化方法依赖隐式、整体的评估或无约束的提示重写，导致行为难以解释、控制或可靠停止。而大型语言模型已从基于验证、针对性修正和提前停止的结构化思维中受益。

Method: CRAFT将提示分解为依赖结构化的视觉问题，使用视觉语言模型验证生成图像，通过LLM代理仅在约束失败时进行针对性提示编辑，并在所有约束满足后使用显式停止标准进行迭代。

Result: 在多个模型系列和挑战性基准测试中，CRAFT持续提升组合准确性、文本渲染和基于偏好的评估，特别对轻量级生成器有显著提升，且推理时间开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 显式结构化、约束驱动的推理时推理是提升多模态生成模型可靠性的关键要素，允许较小或更便宜的模型接近更昂贵系统的质量。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.

Conclusion: SmartSplat通过自适应特征感知的高斯泼溅框架，有效解决了超高分辨率图像压缩中质量与效率的平衡问题，为实时解码和端侧应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lif314/SmartSplat.

Motivation: 现有大视觉语言模型在视频监控中存在对正常场景的固有偏置，难以有效检测犯罪；而思维链推理策略缺乏异常归纳偏置，进一步导致模型偏向正常解释

Method: 提出Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT)多智能体推理框架，在推理过程中通过最终的异常聚焦分类层引入归纳犯罪偏置

Result: 在低分辨率视频中异常检测F1分数提升11.8个百分点，在高分辨率视频中异常分类提升3.78个百分点

Conclusion: CoAT框架通过引入异常偏置推理有效解决了大视觉语言模型在视频监控中的犯罪检测局限性，显著提升了异常检测和分类性能

Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.

Abstract: Skin cancer can be identified by dermoscopic examination and ocular inspection, but early detection significantly increases survival chances. Artificial intelligence (AI), using annotated skin images and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), improves diagnostic accuracy. This paper presents an early skin cancer classification method using a soft voting ensemble of CNNs. In this investigation, three benchmark datasets, namely HAM10000, ISIC 2016, and ISIC 2019, were used. The process involved rebalancing, image augmentation, and filtering techniques, followed by a hybrid dual encoder for segmentation via transfer learning. Accurate segmentation focused classification models on clinically significant features, reducing background artifacts and improving accuracy. Classification was performed through an ensemble of MobileNetV2, VGG19, and InceptionV3, balancing accuracy and speed for real-world deployment. The method achieved lesion recognition accuracies of 96.32\%, 90.86\%, and 93.92\% for the three datasets. The system performance was evaluated using established skin lesion detection metrics, yielding impressive results.

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

Abstract: This manuscript explores multimodal alignment, translation, fusion, and transference to enhance machine understanding of complex inputs. We organize the work into five chapters, each addressing unique challenges in multimodal machine learning.
  Chapter 3 introduces Spatial-Reasoning Bert for translating text-based spatial relations into 2D arrangements between clip-arts. This enables effective decoding of spatial language into visual representations, paving the way for automated scene generation aligned with human spatial understanding.
  Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability.
  Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs. We develop a benchmark for linking natural language to entities and predicates, addressing ambiguities in text extraction to provide clearer, actionable insights.
  Chapter 6 explores multimodal fusion methods for compositional action recognition. We propose a method fusing video frames and object detection representations, improving recognition robustness and accuracy.
  Chapter 7 investigates multimodal knowledge transference for egocentric action recognition. We demonstrate how multimodal knowledge distillation enables RGB-only models to mimic multimodal fusion-based capabilities, reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.
  These contributions advance methodologies for spatial language understanding, medical text interpretation, knowledge graph enrichment, and action recognition, enhancing computational systems' ability to process complex, multimodal inputs across diverse applications.

*Kaitong Cai,Jensen Zhang,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SirenPose是一种结合周期性激活网络与关键点几何监督的几何感知损失函数，用于从单目视频中准确且时序一致地重建动态3D场景，在快速运动、多物体交互等挑战性场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在快速运动、多物体交互、遮挡和快速场景变化等挑战性场景中，常常难以保持运动保真度和时空一致性。需要一种能够处理复杂动态并保持物理合理重建的方法。

Method: 1. 结合正弦表示网络的周期性激活特性与基于关键点的几何监督；2. 引入物理启发的约束来强制空间和时间维度上的关键点预测一致性；3. 利用高频信号建模捕捉细粒度几何细节；4. 扩展UniKPT数据集至60万标注实例；5. 集成图神经网络建模关键点关系和结构相关性。

Result: 在Sintel、Bonn和DAVIS基准测试中，SirenPose始终优于最先进方法。在DAVIS上：FVD降低17.8%，FID降低28.7%，LPIPS提升6.0%。同时改进了时序一致性、几何精度、用户评分和运动平滑度。在姿态估计中，相比Monst3R具有更低的绝对轨迹误差以及平移和旋转相对姿态误差。

Conclusion: SirenPose通过几何感知的损失公式，成功解决了动态3D场景重建中的运动保真度和时空一致性问题，特别是在处理快速运动、复杂动态和物理合理重建方面表现出色，为单目视频的3D重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce SirenPose, a geometry-aware loss formulation that integrates the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with keypoint-based geometric supervision, enabling accurate and temporally consistent reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos. Existing approaches often struggle with motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in challenging settings involving fast motion, multi-object interaction, occlusion, and rapid scene changes. SirenPose incorporates physics inspired constraints to enforce coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions, while leveraging high frequency signal modeling to capture fine grained geometric details. We further expand the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances and integrate graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS demonstrate that SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On DAVIS, SirenPose achieves a 17.8 percent reduction in FVD, a 28.7 percent reduction in FID, and a 6.0 percent improvement in LPIPS compared to MoSCA. It also improves temporal consistency, geometric accuracy, user score, and motion smoothness. In pose estimation, SirenPose outperforms Monst3R with lower absolute trajectory error as well as reduced translational and rotational relative pose error, highlighting its effectiveness in handling rapid motion, complex dynamics, and physically plausible reconstruction.

TL;DR: AlignPose：一种无需物体特定训练的多视角6D位姿估计方法，通过特征度量优化在多个校准RGB视图中聚合信息，在工业数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单视角RGB方法存在深度模糊、遮挡和杂乱问题，而现有多视角方法要么依赖精确的单视角估计，要么缺乏对未见物体的泛化能力。

Method: 提出多视角特征度量细化方法，优化单个一致的世界坐标系物体位姿，最小化渲染物体特征与观测图像特征在所有视图中的差异。

Result: 在YCB-V、T-LESS、ITODD-MV、HouseCat6D四个数据集上超越其他方法，尤其在工业数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: AlignPose通过多视图信息聚合有效解决了单视角方法的局限性，无需物体特定训练即可实现高精度6D位姿估计，特别适用于多视图可用的工业场景。

Abstract: Single-view RGB model-based object pose estimation methods achieve strong generalization but are fundamentally limited by depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects. We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously. Third, we report extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using the BOP benchmark evaluation and show that AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available in practice.

TL;DR: MTIF提出了一种多粒度文本引导的图像融合方法，通过分层跨模态调制模块，利用细粒度、结构性和语义性文本描述指导图像融合，在曝光和焦点融合任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用粗粒度文本描述作为辅助指导，但难以理解细粒度细节，且跨模态对齐不精确。需要更精细的文本指导来提升融合质量。

Method: 1. 引入多粒度文本描述（细节、结构、语义）；2. 分层跨模态调制模块；3. 每个粒度级别的监督信号；4. 显著性驱动的数据增强模块。

Result: 在多重曝光和多重焦点图像融合任务上，MTIF均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多粒度文本描述和分层跨模态调制能有效提升图像融合质量，解决了粗粒度文本指导的局限性。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了DSR Suite，包括自动化生成动态空间推理数据集DSR-Train和评估基准DSR-Bench的方法，以及轻量级几何选择模块GSM，用于增强视觉语言模型的动态空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在通用理解方面表现出色，但在动态空间推理方面较弱，即理解3D空间中物体几何和关系随时间演变的能力。这主要是由于缺乏可扩展的4D感知训练资源。

Method: 1) 提出自动化流水线，从野外视频生成动态空间推理的多选题对；2) 利用现代视觉基础模型提取丰富的几何和运动信息；3) 构建DSR-Train训练集和人工精炼的DSR-Bench评估集；4) 提出轻量级几何选择模块GSM，将几何先验知识集成到视觉语言模型中。

Result: 将DSR-Train和GSM集成到Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型中，显著提升了其动态空间推理能力，同时在通用视频理解基准上保持了准确性。

Conclusion: DSR Suite通过数据集、基准和模型的综合方法，有效解决了视觉语言模型在动态空间推理方面的不足，为4D感知推理提供了完整的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) excel at general understanding yet remain weak at dynamic spatial reasoning (DSR), i.e., reasoning about the evolvement of object geometry and relationship in 3D space over time, largely due to the scarcity of scalable 4D-aware training resources. To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashVLM是一个文本引导的视觉令牌选择框架，通过跨模态相似性计算和视觉显著性融合，动态适应查询需求，实现高效视觉令牌压缩，在保持性能的同时大幅减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型处理大量视觉令牌时存在二次注意力成本和冗余问题。现有令牌减少方法要么忽略文本查询，要么依赖不稳定的深度注意力图，在激进剪枝时导致语义对齐退化。

Method: 提出FlashVLM框架：1) 在语言模型空间中计算投影图像令牌与归一化文本嵌入之间的显式跨模态相似性；2) 使用对数域加权和温度控制锐化将外在相关性与内在视觉显著性融合；3) 通过多样性保留分区保留最小但具代表性的背景令牌以维持全局上下文。

Result: 在相同令牌预算和评估协议下，FlashVLM在LLaVA 1.5上剪枝高达77.8%的视觉令牌，实现超越无损压缩的效果，轻微超过未剪枝基线，即使在94.4%压缩率下仍保持92.8%准确率。在14个图像和视频基准测试中展示了最先进的效率-性能权衡。

Conclusion: FlashVLM通过文本引导的视觉令牌选择，实现了高效的视觉令牌压缩，在主流视觉语言模型中保持强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力，提供了卓越的效率-性能平衡。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

TL;DR: DiTracker利用预训练的视频扩散变换器进行点跟踪，通过注意力匹配、轻量级微调和成本融合，在挑战性基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于ResNet等浅层卷积网络的方法处理帧间独立，缺乏时间一致性，在挑战性条件下匹配不可靠。视频扩散变换器在大规模真实视频上预训练，具有时空注意力，天生具备点跟踪能力。

Method: 提出DiTracker，通过三种方式适配视频扩散变换器：1) 查询-键注意力匹配；2) 轻量级LoRA微调；3) 与ResNet骨干网络进行成本融合。

Result: DiTracker在ITTO基准上达到SOTA性能，在TAP-Vid基准上匹配或超越SOTA模型，尽管训练批次大小小8倍。

Conclusion: 视频扩散变换器特征是点跟踪的有效且高效基础，验证了预训练视频模型在点跟踪任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks. Our work validates video DiT features as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedPOD是一种用于联邦学习的优化方法，通过比例编排导数提高学习效率和通信成本，解决了FedPIDAvg在数据利用和参与者依赖方面的限制，同时兼容Kubernetes自动扩展架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FedPIDAvg方法存在两个主要问题：1) 基于泊松分布排除异常值参与者会限制数据利用；2) PID控制器需要在整个联邦学习过程中保持相同参与者，因为它使用前几轮的学习信息。FedPOD旨在解决这些问题，同时提高学习效率和通信成本。

Method: FedPOD采用比例编排导数方法：1) 包含被排除的异常值参与者；2) 消除对前几轮学习信息的依赖；3) 应用每轮计算验证损失的方法。设计灵感来自Kubernetes的最小计算单元POD，支持类似Kubernetes自动扩展的横向扩展设计。

Result: FedPOD在Dice分数上表现出与FedPIDAvg相当的性能：WT为0.78，ET为0.71，TC为0.72（平均值），平均收敛分数为0.74。同时提高了学习效率、灵活性和通信成本优化。

Conclusion: FedPOD通过解决FedPIDAvg的限制，展示了增强联邦学习的潜力，在效率、灵活性和性能指标方面都有改进，并且与Kubernetes架构兼容，支持灵活的横向扩展设计。

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

Motivation: 现有视频化身生成方法虽然能保持身份一致性和动作对齐，但缺乏真正的自主性，无法通过自适应环境交互来追求长期目标

Method: 提出ORCA框架，包含：1) 闭环OTAR循环（观察-思考-行动-反思），在生成不确定性下保持鲁棒状态跟踪；2) 分层双系统架构，系统2进行战略推理和状态预测，系统1将抽象计划转化为具体的动作描述

Result: ORCA在任务成功率和行为一致性方面显著优于开环和非反思基线，验证了内部世界模型设计对提升视频化身智能的有效性

Conclusion: ORCA框架将视频化身智能从被动动画推进到主动、目标导向的行为，为视频化身提供了真正的自主性和长期规划能力

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

TL;DR: SpatialTree：基于认知科学构建的MLLM空间能力四层评估框架，揭示了能力间的层级关系与迁移规律，并提出自思考策略提升整体性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的空间能力研究缺乏系统性，大多局限于少数任务，未能反映认知科学中空间能力从感知到推理的渐进发展层次

Method: 提出SpatialTree四层框架（L1感知、L2心理映射、L3模拟、L4智能体能力），构建首个能力中心化的层级化基准，评估主流MLLMs在27种子能力上的表现，并通过监督微调和强化学习探索能力迁移与提升策略

Result: 评估显示：L1技能相对独立，高级技能高度相关；微调发现L1内存在负迁移，但低层到高层有强跨级迁移；单纯强化学习的"过度思考"会损害直觉感知，而提出的自思考策略能抑制不必要思考，实现各层级性能一致提升

Conclusion: SpatialTree为理解和系统化提升MLLMs空间能力提供了概念验证框架，揭示了能力层级间的依赖关系和迁移规律，为未来模型能力发展提供了系统性指导

Abstract: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

TL;DR: SemanticGen提出了一种在语义空间生成视频的两阶段方法，先在高层次语义空间进行全局规划，再添加高频细节，相比直接在VAE潜在空间生成能更快收敛且计算更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型通常在VAE潜在空间学习视频分布，然后通过VAE解码器映射到像素。这种方法虽然能生成高质量视频，但在生成长视频时收敛慢且计算成本高。

Method: 采用两阶段生成过程：第一阶段，扩散模型生成紧凑的语义视频特征，定义视频的全局布局；第二阶段，另一个扩散模型基于这些语义特征生成VAE潜在表示，最终输出视频。

Result: 在语义空间生成比在VAE潜在空间生成收敛更快，扩展到长视频生成时既有效又计算高效。实验表明SemanticGen能生成高质量视频，优于最先进方法和强基线。

Conclusion: 通过先在语义空间进行全局规划再添加细节的两阶段方法，SemanticGen解决了现有视频生成模型收敛慢和计算成本高的问题，实现了高质量且高效的长视频生成。

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

Abstract: Advances in LLMs have produced agents with knowledge and operational capabilities comparable to human scientists, suggesting potential to assist, accelerate, and automate research. However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks. We evaluate PhysMaster on problems from high-energy theory, condensed matter theory to astrophysics, including: (i) acceleration, compressing labor-intensive research from months to hours; (ii) automation, autonomously executing hypothesis-driven loops ; and (iii) autonomous discovery, independently exploring open problems.

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

Motivation: 现有评估方法要么只关注非具身的社交推理（如文本），要么只关注无社交意识的物理任务，无法评估智能体在真实具身环境中整合物理约束和社交规范的能力。

Method: 提出S³IT基准测试，核心是座位排序任务：智能体需要在3D环境中为一群具有不同身份、偏好和复杂人际关系的LLM驱动的NPC安排座位。采用可扩展的程序化框架生成多样化场景，要求智能体通过主动对话获取偏好、自主探索感知环境，并在复杂约束网络中进行多目标优化。

Result: 评估当前最先进的LLM发现它们在S³IT上表现不佳，与人类基线有明显差距。结果表明LLM在空间智能方面存在不足，但在处理具有明确文本线索的冲突时能达到接近人类水平的能力。

Conclusion: S³IT基准测试填补了具身社交智能评估的空白，揭示了当前LLM在整合物理和社交约束方面的局限性，为未来具身智能研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

Motivation: 对称性对理解物理系统和提升机器学习性能都很重要，但通常需要先验知识。本文旨在直接从数据中学习对称性，无需过多假设

Method: 将对称性发现建模为在更大假设群上学习分布，使学习分布与数据中观察到的对称性匹配。提出LieFlow方法，使用李群上的流匹配，并针对目标模式对称排列导致的"最后一刻收敛"问题，引入新的流匹配插值方案

Result: 在2D和3D点云上的实验表明，方法能成功发现离散群，包括通过复数域流匹配发现的反射对称性。解决了"最后一刻收敛"问题

Conclusion: LieFlow方法相比先前工作更灵活，能发现更多类型的群，且需要更少假设，为直接从数据中发现对称性提供了有效框架

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.

Motivation: 分子编辑和优化是多步骤问题，需要迭代改进属性同时保持化学有效性和结构相似性。现有方法缺乏将分子设计形式化为智能体强化学习问题的框架，无法实现推理、工具使用和分子优化的有机结合。

Method: 提出MolAct框架，将分子设计形式化为序列化、工具引导的决策过程。采用两阶段训练范式：1) 先构建编辑能力；2) 再利用已学习的编辑行为优化属性。智能体通过多轮交互调用化学工具进行有效性检查、属性评估和相似性控制，并利用反馈优化后续编辑。

Abstract: Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open "thinking" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed "thinking" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.

*Xingyou Yin,Ceyao Zhang,Min Hu,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过向原始时间序列注入噪声再进行标记化，提升冻结LLM在零样本时间序列预测中的性能，无需微调即可增强模型鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖微调专门模块来弥合时间序列数据与LLM预训练知识之间的差距，但完全冻结的LLM对输入数据的文本表示极其敏感。本文旨在探索无需任何微调、仅通过策略性标记化就能有效利用现成LLM进行时间序列预测的方法

Method: 提出一种简单而有效的策略：在标记化前向原始时间序列注入噪声。这种非侵入式干预作为推理时增强，迫使冻结的LLM基于鲁棒的时间模式而非表面数值伪影进行外推。还引入了两个新的时间序列数据集，完全排除LLM预训练数据污染的可能偏差

Result: 在多样化基准测试中经验证有效，特别是在两个新引入的数据集上持续观察到性能提升，证明了该方法在直接利用现成LLM进行时间序列预测方面的有效性

Conclusion: 噪声注入作为一种推理时增强策略，能够显著提升冻结LLM在时间序列预测中的鲁棒性和性能，为直接利用现成LLM进行时间序列预测提供了进一步的技术支持

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

TL;DR: 开发基于双向门控循环单元(BiGRU)的数据中心PUE预测模型，通过特征选择和超参数优化提升预测精度，并与标准GRU模型进行性能比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据中心能耗巨大且碳足迹显著，随着边缘计算和AI发展，存储容量需求增长，能源效率成为应对气候变化、降低成本、提升竞争力的关键。PUE是衡量数据中心运行效率的重要指标，预测PUE有助于理解各特征对能耗的影响，从而针对性地改进能效。

Conclusion: BiGRU模型能够有效预测数据中心PUE，为理解特征对能耗的影响提供工具，从而支持针对性的能效改进措施，促进数据中心可持续发展和能源管理优化。

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

Motivation: 探究人类与大型语言模型在概念推理任务中的泛化能力差异，理解两者在数学概念推断上的根本区别

Method: 使用数字游戏作为概念推理任务，以贝叶斯模型为分析框架，比较人类和LLM的归纳偏好与推理策略

Result: 贝叶斯模型能更好地捕捉人类行为：人类灵活推断基于规则和相似性的概念，而LLM更依赖数学规则；人类能从单个示例进行少样本泛化，而LLM需要更多样本

Conclusion: 人类与LLM在数学概念推断和泛化方面存在根本差异，人类展现出更灵活的推理能力和更强的少样本学习能力

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

TL;DR: 提出PreSa方法，通过直接学习策略而非间接学习奖励/成本模型，结合偏好学习和安全对齐，在离线偏好强化学习中实现安全策略学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线偏好强化学习(PbRL)避免了大量奖励工程和人工标注需求，但在许多领域和任务中确保安全性仍是关键挑战。现有基于人类反馈的安全RL方法先学习奖励和成本模型，再用约束RL优化安全策略，但在长时域连续控制任务中，奖励和成本误差会累积，导致性能下降

Method: 提出PreSa方法：1) 直接基于成对偏好学习策略，而非间接学习奖励/成本模型；2) 结合偏好学习模块和安全对齐，构建约束优化问题；3) 在拉格朗日框架内求解，直接学习奖励最大化且安全的策略，避免使用约束RL

Result: 在连续控制任务中，使用合成和真实人类反馈进行评估，PreSa方法成功学习到高奖励的安全策略，优于最先进的基线方法，甚至优于使用真实奖励和成本的离线安全RL方法

Conclusion: PreSa框架通过直接学习策略而非间接学习奖励/成本模型，有效解决了离线偏好强化学习中的安全对齐问题，在长时域连续控制任务中表现出色

Abstract: Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: MemR³：一个具有闭环控制的自主记忆检索系统，通过路由器和证据缺口跟踪器优化LLM代理的记忆检索质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆系统主要关注压缩和存储优化，但对记忆检索的显式闭环控制关注不足。需要构建一个自主、准确、兼容的记忆检索系统来提升LLM代理的问答质量。

Method: 提出MemR³系统，包含两个核心机制：1）路由器（选择检索、反思、回答动作以优化答案质量）；2）全局证据缺口跟踪器（显式呈现回答过程透明度并跟踪证据收集过程）。该系统采用闭环控制机制，区别于传统的检索-回答流水线。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准测试中，MemR³超越了强基线模型，在LLM-as-a-Judge评分上表现优异。特别地，它改进了四类现有检索器，使用GPT-4.1-mini后端时，在RAG上整体提升7.29%，在Zep上提升1.94%。

Conclusion: MemR³提供了一个即插即用的控制器，可用于现有记忆存储系统，通过闭环控制机制实现自主决策，显著提升了记忆检索的质量和透明度。

Abstract: Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G独立组网和6G演进中，运营商面临超出静态自动化和深度强化学习极限的编排挑战。虽然LLM代理提供了基于意图的网络管理路径，但引入了拓扑幻觉和政策不合规等随机风险。

Method: 提出Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC)神经符号框架，包含治理三元组：电信适配代理(TSLAM-4B)、网络知识图谱(NKG)和SHACL约束，通过确定性验证约束概率规划。

Result: 在模拟的450节点5G核心网上评估，实现零安全违规和94.1%的修复成功率，显著优于82.4%的基线。NKG验证贡献68%的安全增益，SHACL政策贡献24%。验证延迟随子图大小呈O(k^1.2)扩展，处理开销142ms。

Conclusion: G-SPEC框架通过神经符号方法有效缓解LLM代理的随机风险，验证了其在SMO层操作的可行性，为5G/6G网络编排提供了安全可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: As networks evolve toward 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges that exceed the limits of static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size. With a processing overhead of 142ms, G-SPEC is viable for SMO-layer operations.

Conclusion: ActionFlow通过创新的系统级优化方法，有效解决了VLA模型在边缘设备上的推理延迟问题，为实现实时机器人交互提供了可行的技术方案

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Abstract: While CodeMem establishes executable code as the optimal representation for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from a blank slate remains underexplored. This paper operationalizes the transition of Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects. Through a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task involving Outlook and OneDrive, we identify and address four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation: the Discovery Gap involving navigation of large tool registries, the Verification Gap regarding grounding tool response structures, the Decomposition Gap which replaces inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring, and the Scaling Gap focused on concurrency and persistence. We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills.

Motivation: 当前生成式AI在化学空间探索中存在瓶颈：大量生成的分子合成不可行。现有解决方案（如后过滤或基于模板的方法）往往损害结构新颖性或破坏关键药效团。

Method: 将合成可行性优化重构为精确的结构编辑问题而非序列翻译任务。利用大语言模型的推理能力，预测可执行的原子级编辑序列，避免SMILES直接生成的语法脆弱性，同时利用其化学直觉。

Result: 在基准测试中优于现有方法，能生成具有高结构保真度的可合成类似物。通过交互感知提示，成功复制了专家药物化学直觉，编辑PLK1抑制剂并拯救了先前分子生成文献中评分高但被丢弃的RIPK1候选物。

Conclusion: SynCraft通过推理驱动的结构编辑方法有效解决了"合成悬崖"问题，在保持结构新颖性的同时显著提高分子合成可行性，为药物发现中的分子优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has revolutionized the exploration of chemical space, yet a critical bottleneck remains that a substantial fraction of generated molecules is synthetically inaccessible. Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the "synthesis cliff" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.

Abstract: A global shortage of radiologists has been exacerbated by the significant volume of chest X-ray workloads, particularly in primary care. Although multimodal large language models show promise, existing evaluations predominantly rely on automated metrics or retrospective analyses, lacking rigorous prospective clinical validation. Janus-Pro-CXR (1B), a chest X-ray interpretation system based on DeepSeek Janus-Pro model, was developed and rigorously validated through a multicenter prospective trial (NCT07117266). Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings. Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The model architecture and implementation framework will be open-sourced to facilitate the clinical translation of AI-assisted radiology solutions.

Abstract: We propose a Vision-Language Simulation Model (VLSM) that unifies visual and textual understanding to synthesize executable FlexScript from layout sketches and natural-language prompts, enabling cross-modal reasoning for industrial simulation systems. To support this new paradigm, the study constructs the first large-scale dataset for generative digital twins, comprising over 120,000 prompt-sketch-code triplets that enable multimodal learning between textual descriptions, spatial structures, and simulation logic. In parallel, three novel evaluation metrics, Structural Validity Rate (SVR), Parameter Match Rate (PMR), and Execution Success Rate (ESR), are proposed specifically for this task to comprehensively evaluate structural integrity, parameter fidelity, and simulator executability. Through systematic ablation across vision encoders, connectors, and code-pretrained language backbones, the proposed models achieve near-perfect structural accuracy and high execution robustness. This work establishes a foundation for generative digital twins that integrate visual reasoning and language understanding into executable industrial simulation systems.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.
  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了大型语言模型（LLMs）与小型语言模型（SLMs）在预测危重患者休克方面的表现，发现尽管GatorTron-Base取得了最高加权召回率80.5%，但LLMs在预测临床事件方面并不天然优于SLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在自然语言处理领域取得了显著进展，但在预测性任务中的应用研究相对较少。及时预测休克可以促进早期干预，从而改善患者预后，因此需要评估LLMs在临床预测任务中的实际效果。

Method: 使用MIMIC III数据库中17,294次ICU住院的文本数据，筛选出住院时间>24小时且休克指数>0.7的患者（正常组355人，异常组87人）。比较了GatorTron-Base（临床数据训练）、Llama 8B、Mistral 7B等LLMs与BioBERT、DocBERT、BioClinicalBERT、Word2Vec、Doc2Vec等SLMs。在微调过程中使用focal loss和交叉熵损失来处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: GatorTron-Base取得了最高的加权召回率80.5%，但LLMs和SLMs的整体性能指标相当。这表明尽管LLMs在文本任务上表现出色，但在预测未来临床事件方面并不天然优于SLMs。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床预测任务中并不比SLMs具有固有优势。未来训练LLMs的努力应侧重于开发能够预测临床轨迹的模型，而不是专注于命名实体识别或表型分类等简单任务，以实现有意义的临床结果。

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

TL;DR: 研究测试了链式思维推理是否能改善脑转移瘤立体定向放射外科的自动计划质量，开发了SAGE系统并发现推理模型在保持计划质量的同时降低了耳蜗剂量，并提供了可审计的优化轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立体定向放射外科需要精确的剂量分布，但黑盒AI系统由于透明度问题在临床应用中受限。研究者希望探索链式思维推理是否能改善自动计划的质量和透明度。

Method: 开发了基于大语言模型的SAGE自动计划系统，在41例脑转移瘤患者中比较了推理模型和非推理模型的计划质量。推理模型使用链式思维推理进行前瞻性约束验证和权衡决策。

Result: 推理模型在主要终点（靶区覆盖率、最大剂量、适形指数、梯度指数）上与人工计划相当，同时显著降低了耳蜗剂量。推理模型表现出系统性的计划行为，包括457次约束验证和609次权衡决策，而非推理模型几乎没有这些过程。

Conclusion: 链式思维推理不仅能改善自动放射外科计划的质量，还提供了可审计的优化轨迹，为实现透明、可解释的自动计划系统提供了路径。

Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns. We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.
