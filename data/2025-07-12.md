### [1] [Intraseasonal Equatorial Kelvin and Rossby Waves in Modern AI-ML Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07952)
*Shrutee Jalan,Jai Sukhatme*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 现代AI-ML模型（如PanguWeather、GraphCast等）在模拟大尺度对流耦合的Kelvin和Rossby波时表现出部分成功，但仍存在垂直结构和温度异常等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI-ML模型在模拟大尺度Kelvin和Rossby波时的表现，以验证其准确性。

Method: 通过多组PanguWeather、GraphCast等模型的模拟，分析波的水平和垂直结构，并与观测数据对比。

Result: 模型成功捕捉了Kelvin波的水平收敛模式和垂直倾斜，但对Rossby波的垂直结构模拟不准确，且温度异常与垂直速度不一致。

Conclusion: 尽管模型在模拟大尺度波方面表现良好，但Rossby波的结构问题仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: We examine the structure of large-scale convectively coupled Kelvin and
Rossby waves in a suite of modern AI-ML models. In particular, multiple runs of
PanguWeather, GraphCast, FourCastNet and Aurora are performed to assess the
structure of the aforementioned waves. Wavenumber-frequency diagrams of zonal
winds from all models show a clear signature of Rossby and Kelvin waves with
equivalent depths that are in accord with observations and reanalysis.
Composites of Kelvin waves show correct lower and upper troposphere horizontal
convergence patterns, vertical tilts in temperature, humidity and vertical
velocity as well as the phase relation between temperature and vertical
velocity anomalies. Though, differences between models are notable such as
smaller vertical tilts and incorrect surface temperature anomalies in GraphCast
and relatively weak convergent flows in PanguWeather. The models had much more
difficulty with Rossby waves; while the horizontal gyres were captured, the
vertical structure of temperature and divergence was incorrect. Apart from
unexpected tilts in various fields, the temperature anomaly was inconsistent
with the nature of the vertical velocity in all four models. Curiously,
moisture and vertical velocity anomalies were much closer to observations.
Further, only two models (GraphCast and FourCastNet) captured the simultaneous
generation of deep vertical motion with moisture anomalies. In all, while the
representation of these large-scale waves is encouraging, issues with the
structure of Rossby waves and especially the inconsistency among fields require
further investigation.

### [2] [A Robust, Open-Source Framework for Spiking Neural Networks on Low-End FPGAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07284)
*Andrew Fan,Simon D. Levy*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于FPGA的SNN加速框架，针对低端FPGA设计，资源占用少，性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络计算需求激增，SNN因其高效性成为潜在解决方案，但现有硬件难以普及。

Method: 开发了一个包含SNN加速架构和PyTorch模型编译器的框架，支持任意到任意或全连接SNN，资源占用低。

Result: 在低端FPGA上实现高效MNIST识别（0.52 ms/img），并准确模拟手写SNN。

Conclusion: 该框架为SNN在低端硬件上的高效实现提供了可行方案，代码开源。

Abstract: As the demand for compute power in traditional neural networks has increased
significantly, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a potential
solution to increasingly power-hungry neural networks. By operating on 0/1
spikes emitted by neurons instead of arithmetic multiply-and-accumulate
operations, SNNs propagate information temporally and spatially, allowing for
more efficient compute power. To this end, many architectures for accelerating
and simulating SNNs have been developed, including Loihi, TrueNorth, and
SpiNNaker. However, these chips are largely inaccessible to the wider
community. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been explored to serve
as a middle ground between neuromorphic and non-neuromorphic hardware, but many
proposed architectures require expensive high-end FPGAs or target a single SNN
topology. This paper presents a framework consisting of a robust SNN
acceleration architecture and a Pytorch-based SNN model compiler. Targeting
any-to-any and/or fully connected SNNs, the FPGA architecture features a
synaptic array that tiles across the SNN to propagate spikes. The architecture
targets low-end FPGAs and requires very little (6358 LUT, 40.5 BRAM) resources.
The framework, tested on a low-end Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA at 100 MHz, achieves
competitive speed in recognizing MNIST digits (0.52 ms/img). Further
experiments also show accurate simulation of hand coded any-to-any spiking
neural networks on toy problems. All code and setup instructions are available

### [3] [Homeostatic Adaptation of Optimal Population Codes under Metabolic Stress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07874)
*Yi-Chun Hung,Gregory Schwartz,Emily A. Cooper,Emma Alexander*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种理论框架，通过能量预算和噪声水平的生物物理模拟，解释了神经元在代谢压力下的适应性行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学模型无法准确描述神经元在代谢资源限制和噪声特性下的信息处理动态，尤其是观察到神经元在低功耗模式下维持放电率稳态的现象。

Method: 开发了一个理论群体编码框架，结合放电率稳态的近似和能量限制，通过生物物理模拟将ATP使用与噪声水平联系起来。

Result: 提出了一个能量依赖的分散泊松噪声模型，推导了不同能量预算和编码目标下的最优编码策略，模拟结果与实验观察一致。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经元群体在代谢压力下的适应性行为提供了可解释的数学模型，扩展了现有最优群体编码理论。

Abstract: Information processing in neural populations is inherently constrained by
metabolic resource limits and noise properties, with dynamics that are not
accurately described by existing mathematical models. Recent data, for example,
shows that neurons in mouse visual cortex go into a "low power mode" in which
they maintain firing rate homeostasis while expending less energy. This
adaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in
response to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding
framework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple
constraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit
tied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. A key feature of our
contribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework
that generalizes existing optimal population codes. Specifically, our
simulation provides an energy-dependent dispersed Poisson noise model, based on
the assumption that the cell will follow an optimal decay path to produce the
least-noisy spike rate that is possible at a given cellular energy budget. Each
state along this optimal path is associated with properties (resting potential
and leak conductance) which can be measured in electrophysiology experiments
and have been shown to change under prolonged caloric deprivation. We
analytically derive the optimal coding strategy for neurons under varying
energy budgets and coding goals, and show how our method uniquely captures how
populations of tuning curves adapt while maintaining homeostasis, as has been
observed empirically.

### [4] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多级专家混合模型（MMoE）用于多模态实体链接（MEL），解决了现有方法中提到的模糊性和动态模态选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MEL方法未能解决提及模糊性和动态模态内容选择问题，限制了性能。

Method: MMoE包含四个模块：描述感知提及增强、多模态特征提取、层内和层间专家混合，动态选择信息。

Result: 实验表明MMoE优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MMoE通过动态选择多模态信息，显著提升了MEL性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

### [5] [EEvAct: Early Event-Based Action Recognition with High-Rate Two-Stream Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07734)
*Michael Neumeier,Jules Lecomte,Nils Kazinski,Soubarna Banik,Bing Li,Axel von Arnim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高频率双流脉冲神经网络（SNN），在早期事件识别任务中表现优于现有方法，准确率提升2%，并在体育动作捕捉中展示了实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期识别人类活动对安全和响应性至关重要，事件视觉传感器因其高时间分辨率和低延迟适合此需求，但现有方法限制了早期预测能力。

Method: 采用高频率双流SNN处理事件数据，避免传统方法的低速率限制，提升早期预测性能。

Result: 在THU EACT-50数据集上，准确率比之前工作提高2%，并通过早期识别框架验证了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在早期事件识别中表现优异，并在体育动作捕捉等实际任务中展示了潜力。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

### [6] [CoPT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation using Domain-Agnostic Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07125)
*Cristina Mata,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Michael S. Ryoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于协方差的像素-文本损失（CoPT），利用领域无关的文本嵌入来学习图像分割编码器中的领域不变特征，显著提升了无监督领域自适应（UDA）在语义分割中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割的标注成本高，而现有UDA方法未充分利用文本的领域无关特性。

Method: 通过LLM生成领域描述，结合CLIP模型生成文本嵌入，并设计CoPT损失函数学习领域不变特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，CoPT实现了UDA分割任务的最新性能。

Conclusion: CoPT通过文本嵌入显著提升了UDA分割的领域适应能力。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

### [7] [Image Can Bring Your Memory Back: A Novel Multi-Modal Guided Attack against Image Generation Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07139)
*Renyang Liu,Guanlin Li,Tianwei Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Recall框架，通过多模态对抗输入测试图像生成模型的去学习鲁棒性，发现现有方法存在漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨图像生成模型（如Stable Diffusion）在去学习技术中的鲁棒性问题，以应对伦理和法律挑战。

Method: 提出Recall框架，利用多模态对抗图像提示优化，测试十种去学习方法。

Result: Recall在对抗效果、计算效率和语义保真度上优于现有基线，揭示了去学习机制的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 当前去学习方法存在不足，需开发更鲁棒的解决方案以确保生成模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

Result: 提供了XAI方法的综合分类、多模态学习的新视角、评估指标和开源框架的总结。

Conclusion: 该综述为生物医学图像分析中可解释深度学习的发展提供了及时且深入的基础。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

### [9] [Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07151)
*Zongmeng Zhang,Wengang Zhou,Jie Zhao,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的幻觉现象，提出了模态冲突的概念，并构建了MMMC数据集。通过三种方法（提示工程、监督微调和强化学习）缓解幻觉，实验表明强化学习效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中易产生幻觉，现有研究多关注模型响应与输入的冲突，而本文研究多模态输入间的固有冲突如何导致幻觉。

Method: 定义了模态冲突，构建了MMMC数据集，并提出基于提示工程、监督微调和强化学习的三种方法。

Result: 强化学习方法在缓解模态冲突导致的幻觉中表现最佳，监督微调方法表现稳定且有潜力。

Conclusion: 揭示了模态冲突对幻觉的影响，为MLLMs的鲁棒性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

### [10] [Aerial Maritime Vessel Detection and Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07153)
*Antonella Barisic Kulas,Frano Petric,Stjepan Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在GNSS不可用环境下通过UAV和视觉技术进行海上目标船只识别与定位的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS不可用的情况下，UAV需要依赖视觉技术完成大范围搜索和目标识别，这对搜索救援和威胁检测至关重要。

Method: 结合YOLOv8模型检测船只，通过特征匹配和色调直方图距离分析识别目标船只，并利用几何原理定位目标。

Result: 在MBZIRC2023竞赛中进行了真实环境测试，验证了方法的有效性，并分析了视角对检测和定位精度的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法在GNSS不可用环境下能够有效识别和定位目标船只，为自主海上监视提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

### [11] [CL-Polyp: A Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Network for Accurate Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07154)
*Desheng Li,Chaoliang Liu,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的息肉分割网络CL-Polyp，通过自监督学习提升特征提取能力，无需额外标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖额外标注数据和任务相似性，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 采用对比学习增强编码器特征提取能力，引入MASPP和CA模块优化多尺度特征融合和边界重建。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，IoU指标在Kvasir-SEG和CVC-ClinicDB上分别提升0.011和0.020。

Conclusion: CL-Polyp在临床息肉分割任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过语义对齐EEG信号与多级语义描述的方法，实现了从EEG信号到图像生成的先进视觉解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用EEG信号的高时间分辨率但低空间分辨率的特性，通过语义中介实现更准确的视觉解码。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的EEG编码器，通过对比学习将EEG信号与多级语义描述对齐，并利用预训练的潜在扩散模型生成图像。

Result: 在EEGCVPR数据集上实现了最先进的视觉解码效果，揭示了EEG信号与语义描述之间的神经认知路径。

Conclusion: 通过语义中介的方法，能够实现与认知对齐的视觉解码，为神经科学和可解释AI提供了新思路。

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

Motivation: 解决现有视频生成模型在生成长视频时角色和场景一致性不足、多主题视频缺乏连贯性以及帧冗余和时间多样性低的问题。

Method: 分析32篇视频生成论文，总结关键架构和训练策略，构建新的分类法，并通过比较表格对论文进行分类。

Result: 提出了生成高质量长视频的关键架构和训练策略，并构建了新的分类法，为未来研究提供了系统参考。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析和分类，为长视频生成领域提供了关键见解和实用工具，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

### [14] [Colors See Colors Ignore: Clothes Changing ReID with Color Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07230)
*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于颜色的轻量级方法CSCI，用于解决衣物更换重识别（CC-ReID）中的外观偏差问题，无需额外标注或模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖额外模型或标注学习衣物不变特征，资源消耗大。本文探索颜色作为轻量级代理，解决外观偏差。

Method: 提出CSCI方法，利用RGB信息直接提取颜色相关偏差（Color See）并分离身份特征（Color Ignore），引入S2A自注意力防止信息泄露。

Result: 在四个CC-ReID数据集上验证，图像ReID提升2.9%（LTCC）和5.0%（PRCC），视频ReID提升1.0%（CCVID）和2.5%（MeVID）。

Conclusion: 颜色是解决CC-ReID外观偏差的高效低成本方案。

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) production often struggles with slow, resource-intensive
mask generation. This paper presents an automated video segmentation pipeline
that creates temporally consistent instance masks. It employs machine learning
for: (1) flexible object detection via text prompts, (2) refined per-frame
image segmentation and (3) robust video tracking to ensure temporal stability.
Deployed using containerization and leveraging a structured output format, the
pipeline was quickly adopted by our artists. It significantly reduces manual

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态语言引导框架DisenQ，用于解决活动生物识别中的身份与动作动态纠缠问题，并在多个基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生物识别在多样化活动中面临身份线索与动作动态和外观变化纠缠的挑战，现有方法依赖额外视觉数据但易受提取不准确影响。

Method: 提出DisenQ框架，通过结构化文本监督替代额外视觉数据，利用语言指导解耦生物特征、动作和非生物特征。

Result: 在三个活动视频基准测试中达到最优性能，并在传统视频识别基准测试中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DisenQ框架有效解决了活动生物识别中的特征纠缠问题，展示了语言指导在多模态任务中的潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: LinguaMark是一个多语言视觉问答（VQA）基准，用于评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）的多语言能力，发现闭源模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LMMs在多语言覆盖上存在偏差和不公平输出，缺乏对多语言能力的评估。

Method: 提出LinguaMark基准，包含6,875个图像-文本对，覆盖11种语言和5种社会属性，评估指标包括偏差、答案相关性和忠实性。

Result: 闭源模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini2.5）总体表现最佳，开源模型（如Gemma3和Qwen2.5）在某些方面表现竞争性，Qwen2.5在多语言泛化上表现突出。

Conclusion: LinguaMark基准和评估代码已发布，以促进可复现性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型视觉语言模型是否真正进行视觉推理，而非依赖表面模式或数据集偏差。

Method: 引入MagiC基准，包含5500个弱监督QA示例和900个人工标注示例，评估15个模型在四个维度的表现。

Result: 揭示了当前视觉推理模型的关键局限性和改进机会。

Conclusion: MagiC为评估和改进多模态认知模型提供了全面工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADIEE提出了一种自动化数据集创建方法，用于训练评分模型以评估指令引导的图像编辑效果，显著提升了开源和专有模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏有效的自动化评估方法，开源模型对齐困难，专有模型缺乏透明度和成本效益，且无公开训练数据集。

Method: 通过ADIEE生成大规模数据集（100K样本），并微调LLaVA-NeXT-8B模型以解码自定义标记的数值评分。

Result: 评分模型在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著提升与人类评分的相关性（+17.24%）和对比准确率（最高+9.35%）。

Conclusion: ADIEE方法有效解决了评估难题，可作为奖励模型提升编辑选择和模型微调效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

Abstract: Augmented reality is revolutionizing beauty industry with virtual try-on
(VTO) applications, which empowers users to try a wide variety of products
using their phones without the hassle of physically putting on real products. A
critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate
synthesis of foundation-skin tone color blending while maintaining the
scalability of the method across diverse product ranges. In this work, we
propose a novel method to approximate well-established Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory
for faster image synthesis while preserving foundation-skin tone color blending
realism. Additionally, we build a scalable end-to-end framework for realistic
foundation makeup VTO solely depending on the product information available on
e-commerce sites. We validate our method using real-world makeup images,
demonstrating that our framework outperforms other techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在跨帧保持角色和对象身份方面表现不佳，导致引用不一致和幻觉问题，原因是缺乏明确的跨帧实体连接训练。

Method: 采用对比强化学习框架，扩展Story Reasoning数据集，使用合成负例训练模型，结合双组件奖励函数优化实体连接行为。

Result: 模型在实体接地性（mAP提升14.8%）、F1分数（提升17.1%）和跨帧实体持续性（提升13.7%）等方面均有显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了视觉叙事系统中实体连接的准确性和一致性，显著改善了故事的结构化和接地性。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

Conclusion: PacGDC通过高效数据合成显著提升深度补全模型的泛化性能，减少对大规模标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有粒子形状建模方法缺乏自适应性，无法自动调整粒子配置以适应局部几何特征，影响了复杂解剖变异的准确表示。

Method: 提出两种机制：(1) 新颖的邻域对应损失以提高适应性；(2) 测地线对应算法以优化一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应机制和一致性优化，显著提升了粒子形状建模的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

Result: 在五个PES基准测试中，MSAGSM显著提升性能，达到最新最优结果。

Conclusion: MSAGSM是一种轻量级即插即用模块，可有效提升PES任务性能。

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Result: 通过DeformingThings4D-skl数据集和实验验证了模型的有效性，证明了其优越性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了跨类别动物运动的习惯保持转移，为动画和虚拟现实应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

Result: 实验表明Seg-Wild在分割效果和重建质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Seg-Wild为无约束场景的分割和重建提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

Abstract: Flooding remains a major global challenge, worsened by climate change and
urbanization, demanding advanced solutions for effective disaster management.
While traditional 2D flood mapping techniques provide limited insights, 3D
flood mapping, powered by deep learning (DL), offers enhanced capabilities by
integrating flood extent and depth. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of deep learning-based 3D flood mapping, emphasizing its advancements over 2D
maps by integrating flood extent and depth for effective disaster management
and urban planning. The survey categorizes deep learning techniques into task
decomposition and end-to-end approaches, applicable to both static and dynamic
flood features. We compare key DL architectures, highlighting their respective
roles in enhancing prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
Additionally, this work explores diverse data sources such as digital elevation
models, satellite imagery, rainfall, and simulated data, outlining their roles
in 3D flood mapping. The applications reviewed range from real-time flood
prediction to long-term urban planning and risk assessment. However,
significant challenges persist, including data scarcity, model
interpretability, and integration with traditional hydrodynamic models. This
survey concludes by suggesting future directions to address these limitations,
focusing on enhanced datasets, improved models, and policy implications for
flood management. This survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DL techniques for more robust and reliable 3D flood mapping,
fostering improved flood management strategies.

Result: 在遮挡任务中，PSNR提升3.9，Volume IoU提升0.28，重建时间减少95%。

Conclusion: EscherNet++在较小数据集和批量下实现SOTA结果，并适用于真实世界遮挡重建。

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and
understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant
limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks
requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,
we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for
informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector
(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality
multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from
diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning
and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art
MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical
reasoning and science problem-solving. Project page:

Motivation: 超声成像因其简单和非侵入性而广泛应用，但其固有噪声特性对自动分割任务提出了挑战。

Method: 设计了AFSA模块和LGSA模块，分别通过相邻帧语义感知和局部-全局语义融合来减少噪声影响。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时实现了更高的推理速度。

Conclusion: DSANet在噪声鲁棒性和计算效率上均有显著提升，适用于超声视频分割任务。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

Motivation: 蓝白色面纱（BWV）是诊断黑色素瘤的关键特征，但现有研究有限。本研究旨在开发一种高效、准确的BWV检测方法，以辅助早期黑色素瘤诊断。

Method: 使用颜色阈值技术将未标注的皮肤病变数据集转换为标注数据集，设计并训练了一个自定义层的DCNN模型，分别在三个数据集上测试性能，并应用XAI解释模型决策。

Conclusion: 该方法结合XAI显著提升了BWV检测性能，为早期黑色素瘤诊断提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Conclusion: Objectomaly通过对象感知和边界优化，显著提升了OoD分割的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon
publication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GAN的盲人脸图像恢复框架，通过局部统计特征变换和退化无关特征嵌入，显著提升了恶劣天气下人脸识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的人脸图像质量下降导致识别精度降低，现有方法缺乏针对性模块，导致纹理和结构失真。

Method: 结合局部统计特征变换（SFFT）和退化无关特征嵌入（DAFE），分别提升局部统计分布对齐和特征提取的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在抑制纹理失真和重建人脸结构方面优于现有GAN和扩散模型方法。

Conclusion: SFFT和DAFE模块在恶劣天气下显著提升了人脸恢复的结构保真度和感知质量。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体视频被广泛用于VOT训练，但隐私问题被忽视，许多私人视频未经授权被用于商业模型训练。

Method: 提出生成TUEs的框架，结合时间对比损失，破坏跟踪器对原始数据的学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频隐私保护方面表现优异，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TUEs框架有效保护视频数据隐私，适用于多种VOT模型和任务。

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在链式思维（CoT）推理中常忽略生成的推理内容，影响了其准确性和可靠性。

Method: 将多模态CoT推理重新定义为KL约束的奖励最大化问题，并提出RED解码策略，通过结合图像和推理条件分布来优化推理。

Result: RED在多个基准测试和LVLMs中显著优于标准CoT和其他解码方法。

Conclusion: RED为提升LVLMs的推理准确性和可靠性提供了一种实用且有效的方法。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Motivation: 传统视觉提示调优方法使用固定提示，无法适应下游数据的高方差，导致性能不佳。

Result: 在34个数据集上的实验表明，ViaPT优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ViaPT为视觉提示调优提供了新的分析框架和优化方法。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

Conclusion: GGMotion通过建模物理依赖和引入辅助损失，有效提升了运动预测的物理合理性和准确性。

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有内容拼图求解器在真实场景（如文物或文件碎片重组）中缺乏对损坏情况的评估，因此研究其鲁棒性。

Method: 引入三种拼图损坏类型（缺失、边缘腐蚀、内容腐蚀），评估启发式和深度学习求解器的表现。

Result: 标准拼图求解器在损坏增加时性能迅速下降，而深度学习模型通过数据增强可显著提升鲁棒性，Positional Diffusion模型表现最优。

Conclusion: 研究为提升真实场景拼图求解器的鲁棒性提供了方向，尤其是数据增强和先进模型的应用。

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景中的4D对象分割因缺乏大规模标注数据集而未被充分研究，MUVOD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 收集17个场景的多视角视频数据，提供7830张RGB图像及其4D运动分割掩码，并设计评估指标和基线方法。

Result: MUVOD包含459个实例和73个类别，支持多视角视频分割方法的评估，并提供了3D对象分割的子集基准。

Conclusion: MUVOD为动态场景分割提供了重要资源，推动了该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验室小鼠的连续自动化监测能提高数据准确性并改善动物福利，但高密度饲养和相似外观使个体识别困难。

Method: 结合多目标追踪器（MouseTracks）、基于Transformer的ID分类器（Mouseformer）和轨迹关联线性程序（MouseMap）的实时ID算法。

Result: 算法以30帧/秒的速度准确识别小鼠，提高了追踪效率并减少了ID切换。

Conclusion: 该算法优于现有方法，适用于不同小鼠品系和环境条件。

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在密集点轨迹建模中，隐式变形场的神经归纳偏置可能破坏空间一致性，而显式方法依赖启发式节点初始化。稀疏时间信号插值的潜力也未充分探索。

Method: 采用样条轨迹表示，节点数量决定自由度；引入低秩时变空间编码，替代传统耦合时空技术。

Result: 在稀疏输入拟合连续场的时间插值中表现优异，动态场景重建质量与先进方法相当，且无需线性混合蒙皮或刚性约束。

Conclusion: 样条表示和低秩编码有效解决了现有方法的不足，提升了运动一致性和插值性能。

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

Motivation: 解决长视频推理中的独特挑战，如数据规模、训练效率和模型扩展性。

Method: 整合大规模数据集LongVideo-Reason、两阶段训练流程（CoT-SFT和RL）及高效训练基础设施MR-SP。

Result: 在长视频QA基准测试中表现强劲，超越Video-R1-7B，匹配Gemini-1.5-Pro，且MR-SP系统实现2.1倍加速。

Conclusion: LongVILA-R1-7B为长视频推理迈出重要一步，并公开支持多模态RL训练的系统。

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

Result: 实验表明，MAPEX在多种遥感数据集上表现优于全监督训练和现有遥感基础模型。

Conclusion: MAPEX通过多模态专家混合和模态感知剪枝，有效解决了模态不匹配问题，提升了任务性能。

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型通常无法从原始视频数据中学习到有意义的几何感知结构，因此需要一种方法弥补这一差距。

Method: 提出Geometry Forcing方法，通过Angular Alignment和Scale Alignment两个目标，将模型中间表示与预训练几何基础模型的特征对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在相机视角和动作条件视频生成任务中，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing有效提升了视频扩散模型的3D感知能力，为视频生成任务提供了更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型（VLM）在抽象推理任务中存在线性推理瓶颈，并提出线性可分性天花板（LSC）作为衡量标准。通过实验证明，该瓶颈源于语言模型推理路径的失败，而非感知能力不足。通过任务依赖的干预方法，激活现有路径或调整核心权重可解决问题。

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在抽象推理任务中的性能限制，特别是线性推理瓶颈的成因及其解决方案。

Method: 引入线性可分性天花板（LSC）作为评估标准，通过后置调优等方法分析模型的推理路径。

Result: 发现线性推理瓶颈普遍存在，且可通过任务依赖的干预方法解决。激活现有路径适用于语义概念任务，而复杂关系推理需要调整核心权重。

Conclusion: 研究表明，稳健的推理需要有针对性的对齐，而不仅仅是改进表示学习。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型（LLMs）因时空令牌数量庞大导致计算复杂度呈二次方增长，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: STTM通过四叉树结构的多粒度空间令牌转换和时序维度上的定向合并，减少令牌数量。

Result: 在六个视频问答基准测试中表现优异，50%令牌预算下速度提升2倍，精度仅降0.5%；30%预算下速度提升3倍，精度降2%。

Conclusion: STTM是一种高效、无需训练且查询无关的令牌合并方法，适用于视频理解任务。

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

Result: 实验证明DGKD-WLSS在低光条件下的弱监督语义分割任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS有效解决了低光环境下的弱监督语义分割问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The
source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

Motivation: 现有的大脑视觉解码评估协议依赖粗粒度指标，掩盖了模型间的差异，缺乏神经科学基础，且无法捕捉细粒度视觉差异。

Method: 引入BASIC框架，通过结构保真度、推理对齐和上下文一致性三个层次量化解码图像与真实图像的差异。结构层使用基于分割的分级指标，语义层利用多模态大语言模型提取场景表示。

Result: 在多个刺激-神经影像数据集上对多种视觉解码方法进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: BASIC框架为大脑视觉解码方法提供了更具区分性、可解释性和全面性的评估基础。

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉表示学习系统使用固定长度表示，忽略了数据复杂性的变化，而自适应方法通常需要多次编码搜索。KARL旨在通过单次预测实现高效自适应。

Method: KARL基于Kolmogorov Complexity原理，通过单次前向传播预测图像的标记数量，并在达到近似KC时停止。训练采用类似Upside-Down RL的范式。

Result: KARL在单次操作中性能与现有自适应标记器相当，并分析了编码器/解码器规模、连续/离散标记化等因素的影响。

Conclusion: KARL展示了自适应图像标记与算法信息理论的关联，其预测的图像复杂度与人类直觉一致，为高效表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水灾害造成巨大损失，现有方法在覆盖范围和空间细节上存在不足，HOTA旨在填补这一空白，提供更全面的洪水信息。

Method: HOTA通过多尺度重叠分块处理Sentinel-2图像，结合SegFormer模型和DEM差分方法，实现2D洪水掩模和深度估计。

Result: 在澳大利亚Kempsey洪水案例中，HOTA将IoU从73%提升至84%，边界误差小于0.5米。

Conclusion: HOTA能够生成高精度、大范围的3D洪水地图，适用于快速灾害响应。

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

TL;DR: Stable-Hair v2 是一种基于扩散模型的多视角头发转移框架，首次利用多视角扩散模型实现高质量、视角一致的头发转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在捕捉多样复杂发型方面表现出色，但在生成一致且高质量的多视角输出方面仍有不足，这对数字人和虚拟化身等实际应用至关重要。

Method: 提出一个多视角训练数据生成流程，包括扩散模型的光头转换器、数据增强修复模型和面部微调的多视角扩散模型。模型整合极坐标嵌入和时序注意力层，采用多阶段训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能准确转移细节丰富且真实的发型，并在多视角间实现无缝一致的效果，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Stable-Hair v2 在多视角头发转移领域树立了新标杆，代码已开源。

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: This paper presents enhancements to the SAM2 framework for video object
tracking task, addressing challenges such as occlusions, background clutter,
and target reappearance. We introduce a hierarchical motion estimation
strategy, combining lightweight linear prediction with selective non-linear
refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: LOSC方法简单有效，显著提升了3D点云分割的性能。

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

Motivation: 现有评估方法（如IQ测试或数学竞赛）可能因与训练数据重叠而不可靠，且空间可视化能力未得到充分评估。

Method: 开发了SpatialViz-Bench基准测试，包含12个任务和1,180个自动生成的问题，用于评估模型的空间可视化能力。

Result: 评估显示模型性能差异大，存在反直觉行为（如感知困难、2D到3D性能骤降、依赖公式推导而非可视化）。

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench填补了空间可视化评估的空白，揭示了先进模型在此任务中的不足。基准已公开。

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有失败预测方法，适用于后处理场景。

Conclusion: ViLU的架构和训练方法在不确定性量化中起关键作用，代码已公开。

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

Motivation: 现有视频生成方法受限于领域特异性或对高层文本指导的过度依赖，导致运动细节丢失和不真实重建。

Method: T-GVC采用语义感知稀疏运动采样和轨迹对齐损失约束，结合扩散过程，实现低比特率下的高效视频编码。

Result: 实验表明，T-GVC在超低比特率下优于传统编解码器和端到端压缩方法，且运动控制更精确。

Conclusion: T-GVC为基于几何运动建模的生成视频编码开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

Motivation: 现有FER模型存在年龄偏见，尤其是对老年人群体，影响了公平性和可靠性。

Method: 研究通过XAI技术分析偏见，并提出多任务学习、多模态输入和年龄加权损失三种策略。

Result: 实验表明，这些策略显著提高了老年人群体对“中性”、“悲伤”和“愤怒”表情的识别准确性。

Conclusion: 年龄相关偏见可通过简单训练修改缓解，近似人口统计标签对促进大规模情感计算系统的公平性有价值。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要关注细胞的空间特征，忽略了时间动态性，而药物分子模态可能补充图像模态的信息。

Method: 提出MolCLIP模型，结合细胞视频和分子模态，设计分子辅助CLIP框架和度量学习策略。

Result: 在MitoDataset上，药物识别和MoA识别的mAP分别提升了51.2%和20.5%。

Conclusion: MolCLIP通过多模态融合有效提升了药物机制识别的性能。

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

Conclusion: Tree-Mamba和BlueDepth为水下深度估计提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法在去模糊效果和计算效率上均显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

Result: 实验表明CRAFT在跨任务攻击和目标对象更改成功率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CRAFT能有效影响统一VLMs在多任务中的表现，为对抗攻击研究提供新基准。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM的2D架构不适用于3D医学影像数据，现有3D方法复杂且计算资源需求高。

Method: 受SegVol启发，设计了一种简化的3D可提示分割方法。

Result: 减少了推理时间，消除了滑动窗口的复杂性，性能达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D医学影像分割提供了一种高效且简单的解决方案。

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于能量的解码方法，通过动态选择能量分数最低的隐藏状态层，减少大型视觉语言模型中的对象幻觉问题，并在多个基准测试中提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中的对象幻觉问题对其安全部署至关重要，现有方法存在局限性。

Method: 提出基于能量的解码方法，动态选择隐藏状态层以减少偏差。

Result: 在三个基准测试（POPE、MME和MMVP）中显著提升了准确率和F1分数，平均准确率提升4.82%，Yes比例偏差减少8.81%。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能显著减少对象幻觉问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

TL;DR: 提出了一种稀疏-密集侧调谐器（SDST）用于视频时间定位（VTG），结合参考可变形自注意力机制，显著提升了性能并减少了参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练模型的最终层特征，适应性有限，且参数效率低。稀疏特性在MR中被忽视。

Method: 提出SDST架构和参考可变形自注意力机制，结合InternVideo2骨干网络。

Result: 在QVHighlights、TACoS和Charades-STA上取得竞争性或SOTA结果，参数减少73%。

Conclusion: SDST显著提升了性能并降低了参数需求，为VTG任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过实时定量荧光测量改进手术决策，但需要在动态手术环境中实现蓝光和白光模式下的高光谱图像配准。

Method: 提出X-RAFT模型，采用双模态编码器和自监督流循环一致性微调，优化跨模态光流估计。

Result: 相比基线方法，误差减少36.6%；相比现有跨模态光流方法（CrossRAFT），误差减少27.83%。

Conclusion: X-RAFT在神经外科高光谱图像配准中表现出色，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的体素变形估计方法，用于解决增材制造中CAD与XCT体积数据配准的挑战，显著提升了配准精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增材制造中的几何不准确性（如收缩和变形）会影响部件性能，传统数字体积相关方法（DVC）因缺乏参考变形场和大数据量而难以实现精确配准。

Method: 采用动态分块处理的深度学习策略，引入二元差异图（BDM）量化配准精度，并与传统DVC方法对比。

Result: 相比传统方法，Dice Score提升9.2%，体素匹配率提升9.9%，交互时间从几天缩短至几分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于深度学习的DVC奠定了基础，可用于闭环补偿网格生成，提升增材制造的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SCOOTER框架，用于评估无限制对抗攻击的不可感知性，并通过大规模人类参与实验验证了现有攻击方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无限制对抗攻击可以绕过传统防御策略，但缺乏统一的评估框架和统计显著性的验证方法。

Method: 提出SCOOTER框架，包括最佳实践指南、大规模人类与模型对比实验、开源工具和基准数据集。

Result: 实验表明，现有攻击方法无法生成不可感知的图像，且自动化视觉系统与人类感知不一致。

Conclusion: SCOOTER框架填补了评估无限制对抗攻击的空白，并强调了人类感知的重要性。

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

Motivation: 当前3D视觉语言研究中空间推理能力不足，现有数据集常混淆语义与空间关系，导致模型依赖表面捷径而非真正理解空间关系。

Method: 引入S\textsc{urprise}3D数据集，包含200k+视觉语言对和89k+人工标注的空间查询，避免使用对象名称以减少偏见。

Result: 初步测试显示当前最先进的3D视觉定位方法和3D-LLM面临显著挑战，验证了数据集的必要性。

Conclusion: S\textsc{urprise}3D和3D-SRS基准套件将推动空间感知AI的发展，促进具身交互和机器人规划。

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially
aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic
planning. The code and datasets can be found in

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升了rPPG技术的性能，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 现实应用中，多模态输入常存在缺失或不完整的情况，导致性能下降。现有基于提示的方法因静态提示缺乏灵活性和基本提示调优方法在关键模态缺失时性能不可靠而受限。

Method: SyP框架包含动态适配器（动态生成提示）和协同提示策略（结合静态与动态提示），以灵活适应多模态缺失并确保鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SyP通过动态和协同的提示策略，有效解决了多模态缺失问题，具有优越的适应性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究首次将Vision Transformers（ViT）应用于无标记的肺部肿瘤运动预测，比较了患者特异性（PS）和多患者（MP）模型的性能。PS模型在精确度上更优，而MP模型在无需重新训练的情况下表现出更强的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无标记方法多依赖深度学习，但基于Transformer的架构在此领域尚未探索，尽管其在轨迹预测中表现优异。

Method: 使用31名患者的4DCT扫描生成的DRRs训练MP模型，PS模型仅使用目标患者的规划数据。输入16个DRRs，预测1秒内的肿瘤运动，评估指标为ADE和FDE。

Result: PS模型在规划数据上表现更优，但MP模型在治疗数据上无需重新训练即表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ViT首次应用于无标记肿瘤运动预测，PS模型精度高，MP模型适合时间紧迫的临床场景。

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

Conclusion: SimCIS通过简单而有效的方法解决了CIS中的关键问题，并展示了优越性能。

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM为开发稳健的3D异常检测模型提供了具有挑战性的基准，有望推动现代制造业需求的技术发展。

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

Conclusion: SLURPP在速度和恢复质量上均达到领先水平，适用于复杂水下场景。

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在医疗诊断中生成事实不一致的问题，以及检索增强生成中检索不足或过度检索的挑战。

Method: 提出MIRA框架，包含校准的重新思考与重排模块和医疗RAG框架，整合图像嵌入和医学知识库。

Result: 在公开医疗VQA和报告生成基准测试中，MIRA显著提升事实准确性和性能，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: MIRA通过优化检索和知识整合，有效提升多模态大语言模型在医疗领域的应用效果。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于量化SuperPoint CNN的无监督架构，用于在资源有限的平台上高效部署视觉SLAM中的特征点检测与描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代导航系统需要高精度位置估计，而视觉SLAM依赖可靠的特征点提取。资源有限的平台（如移动或嵌入式系统）需要高效解决方案。

Method: 采用量化SuperPoint CNN，结合Brevitas库和FINN框架进行模型量化和硬件优化，在FPGA SoC平台上实现。

Result: 在AMD/Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+平台上处理640x480像素图像达54 fps，性能优于现有方案。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高检测质量的同时显著降低计算需求，适用于资源受限平台。

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CiCi的新型全测试时间适应（TTA）策略，用于远程光电容积描记（rPPG）任务，结合生理学先验知识，通过自监督框架提升模型适应性，实验表明其优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度rPPG模型在未见过部署环境中的适应性受限，隐私和实时适应问题限制了实际应用，因此需要一种无需源数据的实时自监督适应方法。

Method: 基于生理学先验知识，利用rPPG信号在频域的时空一致性和时域的不一致性，提出CiCi自监督框架，并引入梯度动态控制机制以稳定适应。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，CiCi在TTA协议下优于现有技术，实现了无需源数据的实时自监督适应。

Conclusion: CiCi框架通过结合一致性和不一致性先验知识，显著提升了rPPG模型在测试时间的适应性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

Motivation: 现有基准多基于离线固定输入，无法反映真实世界动态探索的挑战，因此设计了OST-Bench以评估在线时空理解能力。

Method: 通过高效数据收集流程构建了1.4k场景和10k问答对，基于ScanNet、Matterport3D和ARKitScenes数据集，评估多个领先MLLM模型。

Result: 模型在复杂时空推理任务上表现不佳，在线设置下准确率随探索时间和记忆增长而下降，主要受复杂空间推理和长期记忆需求影响。

Conclusion: OST-Bench揭示了在线时空推理的核心挑战，为未来研究提供了数据集和基准，促进多模态模型在动态环境中的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在绑定问题上表现不佳，现有方法未能彻底解决，研究怀疑问题根源在于数据属性。

Method: 使用合成数据集系统分析数据属性对CLIP绑定能力的影响。

Result: 发现数据属性（如低密度、不完整标题和显著性偏差）对绑定性能有害，仅特定数据条件下CLIP能实现完美绑定。

Conclusion: 数据属性是解决CLIP绑定问题的关键，现有方法（如增加负样本）无效，需优化数据设计。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific

prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods

narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier

reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension

of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,

Motivation: 探讨预训练数据中概念组合对CLIP/LMMs组合泛化能力的影响。

Method: 使用点间互信息（PMI）衡量词共现频率，并通过合成和自然图像验证其与模型准确性的相关性。

Result: PMI与CLIP零样本准确性高度相关（r=0.97），且在自然图像中重现（r=0.75），LMMs也表现出类似行为。

Conclusion: 需开发新算法和架构以提升多模态模型的组合泛化能力，而非仅依赖数据扩展。

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

Result: 在随机生成的FSMs中，GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini在五次重提内实现100%有效路径成功率；在温度控制实验中，LLM控制器与传统PID性能相当，但能更好地处理非线性动态。

Conclusion: 通过结构化反馈和模块化智能体，LLMs可以统一高级符号规划和低级连续控制，为化学工程中的语言驱动自动化提供了新方向。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

Result: 在KaoKore和PACS数据集上验证，BOOST能平衡性能与公平性。

Conclusion: BOOST是解决艺术领域AI模型偏见的有效方法。

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks,
cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents
and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic
workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a
different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases,
writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and
the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to
carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological
parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark
sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code
is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system
is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.

TL;DR: ViDove是一种基于多模态输入的翻译代理系统，通过结合视觉和上下文背景信息提升翻译质量，显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM翻译代理通常仅支持文本输入，缺乏多模态能力。ViDove旨在模拟人类翻译工作流程，利用视觉和上下文信息改进翻译。

Method: ViDove整合了多模态记忆系统和长短时记忆模块，结合领域知识，提升翻译的准确性和适应性。

Result: ViDove在字幕生成和通用翻译任务中表现优异，BLEU分数提升28%，SubER提升15%。

Conclusion: ViDove通过多模态输入显著提升翻译质量，并推出了新的基准测试DoveBench。

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，其可能被滥用于生成有害内容的问题引发了关注，研究旨在探讨如何通过过滤机制防止此类行为。

Method: 研究分析了输入提示和输出内容的过滤效率，通过计算复杂性理论证明了过滤的局限性，并基于密码学假设提出了分离结果。

Result: 研究发现，高效过滤输入提示和输出内容在计算上是不可行的，且外部过滤无法确保模型的安全性。

Conclusion: 安全需通过模型内部设计实现，而非依赖外部过滤；智能与判断不可分离。

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，Sim-to-Dec显著提高了及时交付率和利润。

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec满足多场景通用性、细粒度动态模拟、历史与预测结合及模拟反馈与策略优化的紧密集成需求。

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

Method: 提出DrugMCTS框架，整合RAG、多智能体协作和蒙特卡洛树搜索，通过五个专业智能体检索和分析分子与蛋白质信息，实现结构化迭代推理。

Result: 在DrugBank和KIBA数据集上，DrugMCTS显著优于通用LLM和深度学习基线，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct性能提升超20%。

Conclusion: 结构化推理、智能体协作和反馈驱动搜索机制对推进LLM在药物发现中的应用至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

Motivation: 现有基准测试很少同时评估生产活动和社会互动能力，StarDojo旨在填补这一空白。

Method: StarDojo包含1000个任务，分为五大领域，并提供100个代表性任务的子集。它提供统一的用户友好界面，支持多操作系统和并行环境实例。

Result: 评估显示当前最先进的MLLM代理（如GPT-4.1）成功率仅为12.7%，主要受限于视觉理解、多模态推理和低层操作能力。

Conclusion: StarDojo旨在推动复杂生产生活环境中稳健开放式代理的研究。

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living

Conclusion: AlgEval为理解LLM的计算提供了系统性方法，有助于提升模型的可解释性和训练效率，推动新架构设计。

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

Conclusion: 规则模型的负面问题需引起重视，现有工具需改进以避免误导性解释。

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上应用于两种SOTA模型，42/48的测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Context Pooling是一种通用且高效的方法，显著提升了GNN在知识图谱链接预测中的表现。

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Conclusion: PlanQA揭示了LLMs在空间推理上的不足，为未来研究提供了改进方向。

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

Conclusion: 稳定偏好优化为偏好对齐目标的设计提供了新思路，并为更可靠和可解释的模型对齐开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

TL;DR: FAI Benchmark评估AI对人类繁荣的贡献，涵盖七个维度，发现现有模型在部分维度表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI评估聚焦技术能力或避免危害，而FAI Benchmark旨在衡量AI对人类全面繁荣的贡献。

Method: 通过1,229个主客观问题，结合专家LLM和几何平均评分，评估28个领先语言模型。

Result: 最高分模型仅72/100，尤其在信仰与灵性、品格与美德、意义与目的维度表现不佳。

Conclusion: FAI Benchmark为开发支持人类繁荣的AI提供了新框架，对AI伦理与评估有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合专家模型（MoE）需要大量训练数据和复杂优化，而MoSE通过技能导向的路由机制，模拟人类驾驶员的学习过程，提高了模型的效率和性能。

Method: MoSE采用技能导向路由机制，定义和标注特定技能，构建分层技能数据集，并通过单次前向过程整合辅助任务。

Result: MoSE在CODA AD任务中表现优于8B+参数模型，激活参数量减少至少62.5%，且性能达到最优。

Conclusion: MoSE通过技能导向学习和推理，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的性能和效率，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI依赖大规模模型和数据集，导致环境、经济和伦理成本高昂，缺乏可持续性和公平性。生物感官系统的动态适应性启发了自适应感知的研究。

Method: 提出自适应感知，动态调整传感器参数（如曝光、灵敏度、多模态配置），以应对协变量偏移并提高效率。

Result: 实证研究表明，自适应感知使小模型（如EfficientNet-B0）超越更大模型（如OpenCLIP-H）。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁将自适应感知整合到实际应用中，并提出研究方向（如标准化基准、实时算法、隐私保护方法），以实现可持续、鲁棒和公平的AI系统。

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

Result: 实验表明，算法能识别现有方法无法处理的系统类别的原因，并通过增加计算时间提高精度和全面性。

Conclusion: 该算法为解决实际原因识别问题提供了实用且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

Result: 资源有限的模型性能将接近最佳模型，计算资源投入的边际收益显著减少。

Conclusion: AI战略和政策需重新审视，以适应模型性能收敛的趋势。

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

Conclusion: 研究结果为科学家提供了数据存储和分析策略的参考。

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

Conclusion: GridTD是一种高效且先进的压缩成像重建方法。

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.
