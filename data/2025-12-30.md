### [1] [The Complete Anatomy of the Madden-Julian Oscillation Revealed by Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22144)
*Xiao Zhou,Yuze Sun,Jie Wu,Xiaomeng Huang*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种"AI-for-theory"范式，利用深度学习模型PhysAnchor-MJO-AE学习MJO的潜在表示，通过聚类揭示了MJO生命周期的六阶段解剖图，并构建了新的物理一致监测框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确描述MJO的生命周期是一个基础性挑战，因为其传播特性使得传统的线性投影方法（RMM指数）常常将数学伪影与物理状态混淆，而原始数据空间的直接聚类则受到"传播惩罚"的困扰。

Method: 开发深度学习模型PhysAnchor-MJO-AE，学习一个潜在表示空间，其中向量距离对应物理特征相似性，从而实现对MJO动力学状态的客观聚类。通过聚类这些"MJO指纹"来发现其内在结构。

Result: 首次揭示了MJO生命周期的完整六阶段解剖图，客观分离了两个长期假设的过渡阶段：印度洋上的组织性增长和菲律宾海上的北向移动。构建的新监测框架将虚假传播和对流错位率降低了超过一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该工作将AI从预测工具转变为发现显微镜，建立了一个可重复的模板，用于从复杂系统中提取基本动力学结构，为MJO监测提供了更精确的物理一致框架。

Abstract: Accurately defining the life cycle of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), the dominant mode of intraseasonal climate variability, remains a foundational challenge due to its propagating nature. The established linear-projection method (RMM index) often conflates mathematical artifacts with physical states, while direct clustering in raw data space is confounded by a "propagation penalty." Here, we introduce an "AI-for-theory" paradigm to objectively discover the MJO's intrinsic structure. We develop a deep learning model, PhysAnchor-MJO-AE, to learn a latent representation where vector distance corresponds to physical-feature similarity, enabling objective clustering of MJO dynamical states. Clustering these "MJO fingerprints" reveals the first complete, six-phase anatomical map of its life cycle. This taxonomy refines and critically completes the classical view by objectively isolating two long-hypothesized transitional phases: organizational growth over the Indian Ocean and the northward shift over the Philippine Sea. Derived from this anatomy, we construct a new physics-coherent monitoring framework that decouples location and intensity diagnostics. This framework reduces the rates of spurious propagation and convective misplacement by over an order of magnitude compared to the classical index. Our work transforms AI from a forecasting tool into a discovery microscope, establishing a reproducible template for extracting fundamental dynamical constructs from complex systems.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 提出基于U-Net和4DVarNet的端到端深度学习框架，利用稀疏卫星测高数据预测7天全球海表动态，性能优于传统业务预报产品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在稀疏卫星测高数据条件下，进行短期全球海表动态（海面高度异常和海表流场）预报的挑战，探索端到端神经网络模型在业务海洋学中的可行性。

Method: 采用U-Net和4DVarNet两种先进架构，将其适配于稀疏天底测高观测序列的7天预报任务。使用GLORYS12再分析数据训练，应用合成天底采样模式模拟实际观测覆盖，将预报任务构建为序列到序列映射。

Result: 端到端神经预报在所有预报时效上均优于Mercator Ocean业务预报基准，在高变异性区域改进尤为显著。通过nRMSE、平均有效分辨率、流速大小和角度预测准确率等指标验证。

Conclusion: 即使在数据稀疏条件下，端到端神经预报模型在业务海洋学中具有可行性和潜力。该框架在OceanBench基准测试计划中开发，促进海洋机器学习领域的可重复性和标准化评估。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end deep learning framework for short-term forecasting of global sea surface dynamics based on sparse satellite altimetry data. Building on two state-of-the-art architectures: U-Net and 4DVarNet, originally developed for image segmentation and spatiotemporal interpolation respectively, we adapt the models to forecast the sea level anomaly and sea surface currents over a 7-day horizon using sequences of sparse nadir altimeters observations. The model is trained on data from the GLORYS12 operational ocean reanalysis, with synthetic nadir sampling patterns applied to simulate realistic observational coverage. The forecasting task is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence mapping, with the input comprising partial sea level anomaly (SLA) snapshots and the target being the corresponding future full-field SLA maps. We evaluate model performance using (i) normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE), (ii) averaged effective resolution, (iii) percentage of correctly predicted velocities magnitudes and angles, and benchmark results against the operational Mercator Ocean forecast product. Results show that end-to-end neural forecasts outperform the baseline across all lead times, with particularly notable improvements in high variability regions. Our framework is developed within the OceanBench benchmarking initiative, promoting reproducibility and standardized evaluation in ocean machine learning. These results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of end-to-end neural forecasting models for operational oceanography, even in data-sparse conditions.

### [3] [Emerging trend in the east-west Dipole Pattern in Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall and the associated impact on Regional Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22499)
*Akshara Satheesh,Rajib Chattopadhyay*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 研究量化了印度季风降雨的东-西不对称趋势，发现西北地区降雨增加，形成东-西偶极模态，与阿拉伯海和孟加拉湾的不同海洋-大气条件有关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统季风降雨模式正在发生变化，需要量化这种变化并理解其物理机制，特别是东-西不对称的降雨趋势。

Method: 使用经验正交函数(EOF)分析季风的空间和时间变化，通过回归分析验证物理机制，分别研究阿拉伯海和孟加拉湾的海平面气压、比湿、海表温度和850hPa纬向风的变化趋势。

Result: EOF模式3显示出明显的东-西偶极模式，西北地区降雨增加。阿拉伯海海平面气压下降、比湿增加、海温升高更显著，而孟加拉湾海平面气压上升。850hPa纬向风增强并向西北方向输送，共同导致西北地区对流增强和降雨增加。

Conclusion: 印度季风降雨模式正在经历东-西不对称变化，西北地区降雨增加主要受阿拉伯海和孟加拉湾不同的海洋-大气条件驱动，这些因素共同创造了有利于西北地区增强对流和降雨的动态条件。

Abstract: Traditionally, during the monsoon season, more rainfall is received along the Western Ghats, the Northern Gangetic plains, the central belt, and northeast India. However, recently, there has been a shift in this canonical monsoon rainfall pattern on the monthly to seasonal scale. In this study, we quantify an east-west asymmetric trend in monthly to seasonal rainfall due to the increased rainfall over the northwestern part of the country. An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis has been performed to understand the spatial and temporal variation of the monsoon. EOF mode 3 shows such a distinct east-west dipole pattern, highlighting the existence of a modal feature representing the recent trend in the rainfall distribution. The physical nature of this mode is also established. The regression pattern of the rainfall anomalies to the Webster-Yang Index (Webster and Yang, 1992) exhibits a similar east-west pattern that further confirms the physical existence of this east-west rainfall modal dipole pattern. Since rainfall across the northwest is directly linked to the Arabian Sea and rainfall over the eastern region to the Bay of Bengal, the characteristics of these two regions are studied separately. Over the Arabian Sea, there is a significant negative trend in the Sea Level Pressure (SLP) anomalies and an increase in the specific humidity, causing greater moisture convergence. In contrast, over the Bay of Bengal, the SLP shows an increasing trend. The SST warming over the Arabian Sea is higher than that of the Bay of Bengal. Further, while investigating the zonal wind(u) at 850hPa, it shows an increasing trend along the northern branch that is more directed towards the northwestern part of the country. These factors together create dynamically favorable conditions for enhanced convection and thus receive more rainfall across the northwest compared to the northeast India.

### [4] [Climate change alters teleconnections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22678)
*Eran Vos,Peter Huybers,Eli Tziperman*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究使用协方差指纹方法证明1960-1990和1990-2020期间影响月温度遥相关模式的变化可归因于人为强迫，并通过多元回归评估五个关键气候模态变化的区域贡献和统计显著性，最后提供这些遥相关对未来气候变化的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究人为气候变化如何影响气候变率内部模态（如厄尔尼诺、北大西洋涛动）的遥相关效应，这一问题目前仍存在不确定性。

Method: 采用协方差指纹方法分析两个时期（1960-1990和1990-2020）月温度遥相关模式的变化，并应用多元回归评估五个关键气候模态（ENSO、NAO、SAM、IOD、PDO）变化的区域贡献和统计显著性。

Result: 研究发现遥相关模式的变化可归因于人为强迫，在许多区域观测到的变化超过了自然变率的预期范围，进一步证实了人为影响的存在。

Conclusion: 人为气候变化已经影响了气候遥相关模式，研究提供了这些遥相关对未来气候变化的预测，强调了人为强迫在改变气候遥相关中的重要作用。

Abstract: Internal modes of climate variability, such as El Niño and the North Atlantic Oscillation, can have strong influences upon distant weather patterns, effects that are referred to as "teleconnections". The extent to which anthropogenic climate change has and will continue to affect these teleconnections, however, remains uncertain. Here, we employ a covariance fingerprinting approach to demonstrate that shifts in teleconnection patterns affecting monthly temperatures between the periods 1960-1990 and 1990-2020 are attributable to anthropogenic forcing. We further apply multilinear regression to assess the regional contributions and statistical significance of changes in five key climate modes: the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Southern Annular Mode, Indian Ocean Dipole, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In many regions, observed changes exceed what would be expected from natural variability alone, further implicating an anthropogenic influence. Finally, we provide projections of how these teleconnections will alter in response to further changes in climate.

### [5] [Contrasting different noise models for representing westerly wind bursts in a recharge oscillator model of ENSO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22710)
*Georg A. Gottwald,Eli Tziperman,Alexey Fedorov*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究提出使用条件加性-乘性噪声模型来改进西风爆发对厄尔尼诺事件的模拟，相比传统高斯噪声能更好地捕捉西风爆发的间歇性特征、厄尔尼诺-拉尼娜不对称性，以及极端暖事件的单调增长特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 西风爆发对厄尔尼诺事件发展有重要影响，但传统使用状态依赖高斯噪声的模型无法充分捕捉西风爆发的特性及其对海表温度的影响，需要更准确的噪声表示方法。

Method: 提出条件加性-乘性噪声模型作为替代方案，并进一步构建条件噪声模型：在海表温度较低时使用加性高斯噪声，超过阈值后使用加性-乘性噪声，以覆盖所有暖事件谱。

Result: 条件加性-乘性噪声能重现西风爆发的间歇性特征，无需确定性非线性就能产生厄尔尼诺-拉尼娜不对称性，并使极端暖事件随西风爆发频率增加而单调增长，更好地模拟极端暖事件。

Conclusion: 条件噪声模型能较好地捕捉观测到的西风爆发特性，为改进ENSO模拟提供了有前景的噪声建模方法，特别是对极端暖事件的模拟效果优于传统高斯噪声模型。

Abstract: Westerly wind bursts (WWBs) have long been known to have a major impact on the development of El Niño events. In particular, they amplify these events, with stronger events associated with a higher number of WWBs. We further find indications that WWBs lead to a more monotonically increasing evolution of warming events. We consider here a noise-driven recharge oscillator model of ENSO. Commonly, WWBs are represented by a state-dependent Gaussian noise which naturally reproduces the amplification of warm events. However, we show that many properties of WWBs and their effects on sea surface temperature (SST) are not well captured by such Gaussian noise. Instead, we show that conditional additive and multiplicative (CAM) noise presents a promising alternative. In addition to recovering the sporadic nature of WWBs, CAM noise leads to an asymmetry between El Niño and La Niña events without the need for deterministic nonlinearities. Furthermore, CAM noise generates a more monotonic increase of extreme warming events with a higher frequency of WWBs accompanying the largest events. This suggests that extreme warm events are better modelled by CAM noise. To cover the full spectrum of warm events we propose a conditional noise model in which the wind stress is modelled by additive Gaussian noise for sufficiently small SSTs and by additive CAM noise once the SST exceeds a certain threshold. We show that this conditional noise model captures the observed properties of WWBs reasonably well.

### [6] [Using a rare event sampling technique to quantify extreme El Niño event statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23038)
*Sarah Packman,Justin Finkel,Dorian S. Abbot,Eli Tziperman*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 使用TEAMS稀有事件采样技术高效生成极端厄尔尼诺事件数据，相比传统直接数值模拟可节省约80%计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端厄尔尼诺事件（如1997-1998年）具有全球性严重影响，但发生频率极低，传统直接数值模拟难以获得足够的统计样本

Method: 采用"trying-early adaptive multi-level splitting" (TEAMS)稀有事件采样算法，通过定向扰动生成大量分支轨迹，优先计算极端事件

Result: TEAMS在Zebiak-Cane模型上准确再现了极端厄尔尼诺事件的回归时间估计，计算成本仅为传统直接数值模拟的五分之一

Conclusion: TEAMS是研究稀有ENSO事件的高效方法，有望应用于全复杂度气候模型

Abstract: Extreme El Niño events, such as occurred in 1997--1998, can induce severe weather on a global scale, with significant socioeconomic impacts that motivate efforts to understand them better. However, extreme El Niño events are rare, and even in a very long direct numerical simulation (DNS) occur too infrequently for robust statistical characterization. This study seeks to generate extreme El Niño event model data at a lower cost, while preserving statistical fidelity, using a rare event sampling technique, which preferentially devotes computational resources toward extreme events by generating a large, branched ensemble of interrelated trajectories through successive targeted perturbations. We specifically use the ``trying-early adaptive multi-level splitting'' (TEAMS) algorithm, which is well-suited for El Niño's relative timescales of predictability and event duration. We apply TEAMS to the Zebiak-Cane model, an intermediate-complexity ENSO model for which it is feasible to run a long DNS (500000 years) for validation. We compare extreme El Niño event return time estimates from TEAMS to those from the long DNS to assess TEAMS' accuracy and efficiency. We find that TEAMS accurately reproduces the return time estimates of the DNS at about one fifth the computational cost. Therefore, TEAMS is an efficient approach to study rare ENSO events that can be plausibly applied to full-complexity climate models.

### [7] [CosineGate: Semantic Dynamic Routing via Cosine Incompatibility in Residual Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22206)
*Yogeswar Reddy Thota*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: CosineGate：基于余弦不兼容性的残差网络动态路由方法，通过自监督跳过信号减少冗余计算，在CIFAR-10上实现准确率与计算效率的帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度残差网络对所有输入都评估所有残差块，即使恒等映射就足够，这导致了大量冗余计算。需要一种能够动态决定是否跳过某些残差块的方法来减少计算开销。

Method: 提出CosineGate架构，使用恒等特征和残差特征表示之间的余弦不兼容性作为自监督跳过信号。定义余弦不兼容比(CIR) = 1 - cos(x, F(x))，使用Gumbel-Softmax松弛实现训练期间的逐样本、逐块门控。通过渐进式FLOPs正则化项控制平均计算使用量。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，CosineGate实现了准确率-效率的帕累托前沿：激进配置达到89.9%准确率并节省24.1% FLOPs；平衡配置达到91.3%准确率并节省28.5% FLOPs；保守配置达到93.2%峰值准确率并最小化计算减少。这些结果匹配或超过ResNet-20（91.3%），同时减少计算，无需辅助监督、蒸馏或任务特定启发式方法。

Conclusion: 简单的几何特征不兼容性度量为动态残差路由提供了原则性且有效的信号，证明了通过自监督跳过信号减少残差网络冗余计算的可行性。

Abstract: Modern deep residual networks perform substantial redundant computation by evaluating all residual blocks for every input, even when identity mappings suffice. We introduce CosineGate, an end-to-end differentiable architecture for dynamic routing in residual networks that uses cosine incompatibility between identity and residual feature representations as a self-supervised skip signal. CosineGate measures semantic redundancy through the Cosine Incompatibility Ratio (CIR), defined as 1 - cos(x, F(x)), and uses Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to enable per-sample, per-block gating during training. A progressive FLOPs regularization term controls average compute usage without destabilizing optimization. On CIFAR-10, CosineGate spans the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier: an aggressive configuration achieves 89.9 percent accuracy with 24.1 percent FLOPs savings, a balanced configuration achieves 91.3 percent accuracy with 28.5 percent savings at epoch 160, and a conservative configuration reaches a peak of 93.2 percent accuracy with minimal compute reduction. These results match or exceed ResNet-20 (91.3 percent) while reducing computation, without auxiliary supervision, distillation, or task-specific heuristics. Our results demonstrate that simple geometric measures of feature incompatibility provide a principled and effective signal for dynamic residual routing.

### [8] [Characterizing Motion Encoding in Video Diffusion Timesteps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22175)
*Vatsal Baherwani,Yixuan Ren,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文通过系统研究视频扩散模型中时间步与运动编码的关系，发现早期时间步主导运动，后期时间步主导外观，并提出基于此的运动定制简化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到视频扩散模型通过迭代去噪合成时空运动，但运动如何在时间步中编码仍不清楚。实践中常用启发式方法认为早期时间步主要塑造运动和布局，后期时间步细化外观，但缺乏系统验证。

Method: 通过在不同时间步范围注入新条件时外观编辑与运动保持的权衡来代理运动编码，进行大规模定量研究。将运动与外观沿去噪轨迹的竞争关系进行量化映射。

Result: 在不同架构中一致识别出早期运动主导阶段和后期外观主导阶段，得到时间步空间中的操作化运动-外观边界。基于此简化当前一次性运动定制范式，仅需在运动主导阶段进行训练和推理即可实现强运动迁移。

Conclusion: 将广泛使用的启发式方法转化为时空解耦原则，时间步约束方法可轻松集成到现有运动迁移和编辑方法中，无需辅助去偏模块或专门目标函数。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models synthesize temporal motion and spatial appearance through iterative denoising, yet how motion is encoded across timesteps remains poorly understood. Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system utilizing a hybrid deep learning architecture combining 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The system processes webcam video streams to recognize word-level ASL signs, addressing communication barriers for over 70 million deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals worldwide. Our architecture leverages 3D convolutions to capture spatial-temporal features from video frames, followed by LSTM layers that model sequential dependencies inherent in sign language gestures. Trained on the WLASL dataset (2,000 common words), ASL-LEX lexical database (~2,700 signs), and a curated set of 100 expert-annotated ASL signs, the system achieves F1-scores ranging from 0.71 to 0.99 across sign classes. The model is deployed on AWS infrastructure with edge deployment capability on OAK-D cameras for real-time inference. We discuss the architecture design, training methodology, evaluation metrics, and deployment considerations for practical accessibility applications.

TL;DR: VISTA是一个模块化视觉语言框架，通过信息瓶颈将感知与推理解耦，使用冻结的VLM传感器进行客观感知查询，文本LLM进行推理，通过强化学习训练无偏视觉推理，显著提升对虚假相关性的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端视觉语言模型（VLMs）在回答视觉问题时经常利用虚假相关性而非因果视觉证据，微调后更容易走捷径。需要一种方法来强制模型基于真实视觉证据进行推理。

Method: VISTA框架将感知与推理解耦：冻结的VLM传感器仅进行简短、客观的感知查询，文本LLM分解问题、规划查询、聚合视觉事实。通过强化学习（GRPO）在仅641个多步问题上训练无偏视觉推理。

Result: 在SpuriVerse上显著提升鲁棒性（Qwen-2.5-VL-7B提升16.29%，Llama-3.2-Vision-11B提升6.77%），在MMVP和SeedBench子集保持竞争力。能跨未见VLM传感器迁移，识别并恢复感知失败。

Conclusion: VISTA通过模块化设计和信息瓶颈强制视觉推理基于真实证据，减少对虚假相关性的依赖，产生更中立、更明确基于视觉证据的推理轨迹，提升视觉问答的鲁棒性。

Abstract: End-to-end Vision-language Models (VLMs) often answer visual questions by exploiting spurious correlations instead of causal visual evidence, and can become more shortcut-prone when fine-tuned. We introduce VISTA (Visual-Information Separation for Text-based Analysis), a modular framework that decouples perception from reasoning via an explicit information bottleneck. A frozen VLM sensor is restricted to short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes each question, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. This controlled interface defines a reward-aligned environment for training unbiased visual reasoning with reinforcement learning. Instantiated with Qwen2.5-VL and Llama3.2-Vision sensors, and trained with GRPO from only 641 curated multi-step questions, VISTA significantly improves robustness to real-world spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), while remaining competitive on MMVP and a balanced SeedBench subset. VISTA transfers robustly across unseen VLM sensors and is able to recognize and recover from VLM perception failures. Human analysis further shows that VISTA's reasoning traces are more neutral, less reliant on spurious attributes, and more explicitly grounded in visual evidence than end-to-end VLM baselines.

*Antara Titikhsha,Divyanshu Tak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMM2D：一种用于动脉瘤检测的双编码器框架，在RSNA数据集上AUC达到0.686，比临床基线提高32%。研究发现，在强预训练骨干网络下，数据增强反而会降低性能，推翻了"增强越多越好"的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动脉瘤检测面临三大挑战：1）动脉瘤形态细微；2）类别不平衡严重；3）标注数据稀缺。传统方法依赖数据增强来缓解数据不足问题，但作者质疑在强预训练模型下这种做法的有效性。

Method: 提出SAMM2D双编码器框架，使用ImageNet预训练骨干网络。关键创新在于发现：在强预训练特征下，任何形式的数据增强都会降低性能。通过阈值校准达到95%敏感度，使用Grad-CAM进行可解释性分析。

Result: 1）AUC 0.686，比基线提高32%；2）无增强模型比所有增强变体高1.75-2.23个百分点；3）95%敏感度超过平均放射科医生水平；4）每1000名患者筛查可节省1390万美元；5）85%真阳性关注相关血管区域。

Conclusion: 在医学影像低数据场景中，强预训练特征已包含足够鲁棒性，额外增强反而有害。未来医学影像工作流应更注重强预训练而非复杂增强流程。该发现挑战了传统数据增强的普适性假设。

Abstract: Effective aneurysm detection is essential to avert life-threatening hemorrhages, but it remains challenging due to the subtle morphology of the aneurysm, pronounced class imbalance, and the scarcity of annotated data. We introduce SAMM2D, a dual-encoder framework that achieves an AUC of 0.686 on the RSNA intracranial aneurysm dataset; an improvement of 32% over the clinical baseline. In a comprehensive ablation across six augmentation regimes, we made a striking discovery: any form of data augmentation degraded performance when coupled with a strong pretrained backbone. Our unaugmented baseline model outperformed all augmented variants by 1.75--2.23 percentage points (p < 0.01), overturning the assumption that "more augmentation is always better" in low-data medical settings. We hypothesize that ImageNet-pretrained features already capture robust invariances, rendering additional augmentations both redundant and disruptive to the learned feature manifold. By calibrating the decision threshold, SAMM2D reaches 95% sensitivity, surpassing average radiologist performance, and translates to a projected \$13.9M in savings per 1,000 patients in screening applications. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm that 85% of true positives attend to relevant vascular regions (62% IoU with expert annotations), demonstrating the model's clinically meaningful focus. Our results suggest that future medical imaging workflows could benefit more from strong pretraining than from increasingly complex augmentation pipelines.

TL;DR: HookMIL：一种用于计算病理学的上下文感知、计算高效的多实例学习框架，通过可学习的hook tokens实现结构化上下文聚合，支持多模态初始化，具有线性复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MIL方法在分析全切片图像时丢失关键上下文信息，而基于transformer的变体虽然表达能力更强，但存在二次复杂度和冗余计算的问题。

Method: 提出HookMIL框架，使用紧凑的可学习hook tokens进行结构化上下文聚合。这些tokens可以从三种方式初始化：(1)关键patch视觉特征，(2)视觉语言病理模型的文本嵌入，(3)空间转录组-视觉模型的空间特征。通过双向注意力机制与实例交互（线性复杂度），引入Hook多样性损失促进专业化，以及hook-to-hook通信机制优化上下文交互。

Result: 在四个公共病理数据集上的实验表明，HookMIL实现了最先进的性能，同时提高了计算效率和可解释性。

Conclusion: HookMIL通过可学习的hook tokens有效解决了传统MIL的上下文信息丢失和transformer变体的计算效率问题，多模态初始化加速收敛并提升表示质量，为计算病理学提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has enabled weakly supervised analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology. However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

### [14] [Tiny-YOLOSAM: Fast Hybrid Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22193)
*Kenneth Xu,Songhan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tiny-YOLOSAM：结合YOLO检测器和TinySAM的混合系统，通过YOLO生成框提示和稀疏点提示，显著提升分割覆盖率和速度，替代密集的"分割一切"模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型计算成本高，不适合延迟敏感场景。TinySAM虽然轻量，但其"分割一切"模式仍需要数百个提示且速度慢，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 首先复现TinySAM建立基准，然后提出Tiny-YOLOSAM混合管道：使用YOLOv12检测器为显著前景对象生成框提示，在YOLO未覆盖区域补充稀疏点提示。

Result: 在COCO val2017上，类不可知覆盖显著提升（AR从16.4%到77.1%，mIoU从19.2%到67.8%），端到端运行时间从49.20秒/图像减少到10.39秒/图像（4.7倍加速）。

Conclusion: 检测器引导提示结合目标稀疏采样是实用全场景分割中替代密集"分割一切"提示的有效方法，显著提升效率和覆盖率。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) enables promptable, high-quality segmentation but is often too computationally expensive for latency-critical settings. TinySAM is a lightweight, distilled SAM variant that preserves strong zero-shot mask quality, yet its "segment-everything" mode still requires hundreds of prompts and remains slow in practice. We first replicate TinySAM on COCO val2017 using official checkpoints, matching the reported AP within 0.03%, establishing a reliable experimental baseline. Building on this, we propose Tiny-YOLOSAM, a fast hybrid pipeline that uses a recent YOLO detector (YOLOv12) to generate box prompts for TinySAM on salient foreground objects, and supplements uncovered regions with sparse point prompts sampled only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage. On COCO val2017, the hybrid system substantially improves class-agnostic coverage (AR from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%) while reducing end-to-end runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x) on an Apple M1 Pro CPU. These results suggest detector-guided prompting combined with targeted sparse sampling as an effective alternative to dense "segment-everything" prompting for practical full-scene segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于视觉语言模型的多模态可解释性模型，通过分析视网膜象限中的病变分布来模拟眼科医生的推理过程，生成配对Grad-CAM热力图，为糖尿病视网膜病变严重程度分类提供视觉解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是全球视力丧失的主要原因，需要早期检测。医生缺乏诊断资源，现有AI模型依赖病变分割但标注不实用，且当前模型单一模态解释性有限。需要能解释分类推理而非仅定位病变的模型。

Conclusion: 该模型克服了当前DR诊断模型的局限性，通过多模态分析和自然语言病变识别，能够在筛查、治疗和研究环境中实现多样化应用，为临床实践提供了更实用的解释性工具。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, requiring early detection to preserve sight. Limited access to physicians often leaves DR undiagnosed. To address this, AI models utilize lesion segmentation for interpretability; however, manually annotating lesions is impractical for clinicians. Physicians require a model that explains the reasoning for classifications rather than just highlighting lesion locations. Furthermore, current models are one-dimensional, relying on a single imaging modality for explainability and achieving limited effectiveness. In contrast, a quantitative-detection system that identifies individual DR lesions in natural language would overcome these limitations, enabling diverse applications in screening, treatment, and research settings. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multimodal explainability model utilizing a VLM with few-shot learning, which mimics an ophthalmologist's reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants for fundus images. The model generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps, showcasing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images, which visually highlight the regions contributing to DR severity classification. Using a dataset of 3,000 fundus images and 1,000 OCT images, this innovative methodology addresses key limitations in current DR diagnostics, offering a practical and comprehensive tool for improving patient outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCFormer是一个仅有500万参数的轻量级弱监督人群计数框架，使用Transformer特征提取器和可学习密度加权平均模块，仅需图像级全局计数标签，在多个基准数据集上实现参数效率与计数精度的优越平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人群计数方法依赖劳动密集的点级标注和计算密集的骨干网络，限制了其在资源受限环境中的可扩展性和部署能力。需要开发轻量级、弱监督的解决方案。

Method: 1) 采用高效视觉Transformer作为特征提取器；2) 设计可学习密度加权平均模块，根据预测密度分数动态重加权局部token；3) 引入密度级别分类损失，将人群密度离散化为不同等级，增强模型对不同密度级别的分类能力。

Result: 在ShanghaiTech A/B、UCF-QNRF和NWPU四个基准数据集上的实验表明，TCFormer在参数效率与计数精度之间取得了优越的平衡，仅需图像级全局计数标签即可实现高精度估计。

Conclusion: TCFormer是一个超轻量级的弱监督人群计数框架，通过联合优化计数和密度级别损失，仅需图像级标注即可实现竞争性性能，适合在边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Crowd counting typically relies on labor-intensive point-level annotations and computationally intensive backbones, restricting its scalability and deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy and can be a good solution for crowd counting tasks in edge devices.

Abstract: Malaria remains a prevalent health concern in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The cause of malaria is the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic blood smear analysis, are low in sensitivity, depend on expert judgment, and require resources that may not be available in remote settings. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a deep learning-based approach utilizing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify blood cell images as parasitized or uninfected. The model achieves an accuracy of 96%, with precision and recall scores exceeding 0.95 for both classes. This study also compares the custom CNN with established deep learning architectures, including ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121. To enhance model interpretability, Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and Saliency Maps are applied. The proposed system shows how deep learning can provide quick, accurate and understandable malaria diagnosis, especially in areas with limited resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图卷积网络(GCNs)在动作识别中表现优异但能耗高，脉冲神经网络(SNNs)能效高但难以捕捉人体运动的时空-频率耦合依赖和拓扑关系，需要结合两者优势

Method: 1. 使用1D脉冲图卷积(1D-SGC)和频率脉冲卷积(FSC)作为主干网络；2. 嵌入拓扑转移自注意力(TSSA)机制自适应学习骨架拓扑；3. 添加多尺度小波变换融合(MWTF)分支分解脉冲特征；4. 拓扑感知时频融合(TATF)单元保持拓扑一致的频谱融合

Result: 在大规模基准测试中，Signal-SGN++实现了优越的精度-效率权衡，超越了现有的SNN方法，并在显著降低能耗的情况下达到了与最先进GCNs竞争的结果

Conclusion: Signal-SGN++成功地将拓扑感知与脉冲动态相结合，为高能效的动作识别提供了有效的解决方案，平衡了计算效率和模型性能

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) demonstrate strong capability in modeling skeletal topology for action recognition, yet their dense floating-point computations incur high energy costs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by event-driven and sparse activation, offer energy efficiency but remain limited in capturing coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. To bridge this gap, this article proposes Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework that integrates structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics. The network employs a backbone composed of 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction. Within this backbone, a Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism is embedded to adaptively route attention across learned skeletal topologies, enhancing graph-level sensitivity without increasing computational complexity. Moreover, an auxiliary Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch decomposes spiking features into multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations, wherein a Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit incorporates structural priors to preserve topology-consistent spectral fusion. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate that Signal-SGN++ achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming existing SNN-based methods and achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs under substantially reduced energy consumption.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves predicting fine-grained attributes such as clothing color, gender, and accessories from pedestrian imagery, yet is hindered by severe class imbalance, intricate attribute co-dependencies, and domain shifts. We introduce VLM-PAR, a modular vision-language framework built on frozen SigLIP 2 multilingual encoders. By first aligning image and prompt embeddings via refining visual features through a compact cross-attention fusion, VLM-PAR achieves significant accuracy improvement on the highly imbalanced PA100K benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art performance, while also delivering significant gains in mean accuracy across PETA and Market-1501 benchmarks. These results underscore the efficacy of integrating large-scale vision-language pretraining with targeted cross-modal refinement to overcome imbalance and generalization challenges in PAR.

Abstract: Understanding signboard text in natural scenes is essential for real-world applications of Visual Question Answering (VQA), yet remains underexplored, particularly in low-resource languages. We introduce ViSignVQA, the first large-scale Vietnamese dataset designed for signboard-oriented VQA, which comprises 10,762 images and 25,573 question-answer pairs. The dataset captures the diverse linguistic, cultural, and visual characteristics of Vietnamese signboards, including bilingual text, informal phrasing, and visual elements such as color and layout. To benchmark this task, we adapted state-of-the-art VQA models (e.g., BLIP-2, LaTr, PreSTU, and SaL) by integrating a Vietnamese OCR model (SwinTextSpotter) and a Vietnamese pretrained language model (ViT5). The experimental results highlight the significant role of the OCR-enhanced context, with F1-score improvements of up to 209% when the OCR text is appended to questions. Additionally, we propose a multi-agent VQA framework combining perception and reasoning agents with GPT-4, achieving 75.98% accuracy via majority voting. Our study presents the first large-scale multimodal dataset for Vietnamese signboard understanding. This underscores the importance of domain-specific resources in enhancing text-based VQA for low-resource languages. ViSignVQA serves as a benchmark capturing real-world scene text characteristics and supporting the development and evaluation of OCR-integrated VQA models in Vietnamese.

TL;DR: 提出Semantic Abstraction框架，利用2D视觉语言模型的激活图作为"抽象物体"表示，学习隐藏物体的3D定位与补全，显著提高搜索效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决家庭机器人寻找隐藏/被遮挡物体时效率低下的问题，传统随机搜索方法耗时耗力，需要更智能的定位方法

Method: 利用2D VLM的激活图作为抽象物体表示，结合历史物体放置数据，学习隐藏物体的3D定位和补全，实现非结构化搜索优化

Result: 模型能准确识别隐藏物体的完整3D位置，首次尝试成功率显著高于随机搜索，搜索速度大幅提升

Conclusion: Semantic Abstraction扩展为家庭机器人提供了高效寻找丢失物体的技能，节省时间和精力

Abstract: Semantic Abstraction's key observation is that 2D VLMs' relevancy activations roughly correspond to their confidence of whether and where an object is in the scene. Thus, relevancy maps are treated as "abstract object" representations. We use this framework for learning 3D localization and completion for the exclusive domain of hidden objects, defined as objects that cannot be directly identified by a VLM because they are at least partially occluded. This process of localizing hidden objects is a form of unstructured search that can be performed more efficiently using historical data of where an object is frequently placed. Our model can accurately identify the complete 3D location of a hidden object on the first try significantly faster than a naive random search. These extensions to semantic abstraction hope to provide household robots with the skills necessary to save time and effort when looking for lost objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoScaffold：用于流媒体视频理解的动态表示框架，通过自适应事件分割和层次化聚合，解决了现有静态方法在连续视频流中的碎片化和过度压缩问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多模态大语言模型的视频理解方法在处理长视频时面临挑战：帧间冗余严重，需要时序连贯的表示。现有的静态策略（如稀疏采样、帧压缩、聚类）针对离线场景优化，应用于连续视频流时会产生碎片化或过度压缩的输出。

Method: 提出VideoScaffold动态表示框架，包含两个核心组件：1) 弹性尺度事件分割(EES)，通过预测引导的分割动态优化事件边界；2) 层次化事件整合(HEC)，逐步将语义相关的片段聚合成多层次抽象表示。两者协同工作，使系统能够随着视频流展开，从细粒度帧理解平滑过渡到抽象事件推理。

Result: 在离线和流媒体视频理解基准测试上的广泛实验表明，VideoScaffold实现了最先进的性能。该框架是模块化且即插即用的，能够无缝扩展现有的基于图像的多模态大语言模型到连续视频理解任务。

Conclusion: VideoScaffold通过动态调整事件粒度和保持细粒度视觉语义，有效解决了长视频理解中的冗余和时序连贯性问题，为流媒体视频理解提供了有效的解决方案，且具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Understanding long videos with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging due to the heavy redundancy across frames and the need for temporally coherent representations. Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds. Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension. The code is available at https://github.com/zheng980629/VideoScaffold.

*HaoNan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出KAN-FPN-Stem架构，通过用KAN卷积层替换FPN末端的线性平滑卷积，解决ViT前端设计中特征融合质量不足的问题，在COCO数据集上比ViTPose-S提升2.0 AP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ViT模型（如ViTPose）的前端设计过于简单，朴素的patch化机制难以有效处理多尺度变化，并在初始特征提取阶段造成不可逆的信息损失，限制了密集预测任务的性能。

Method: 保留FPN经典的"上采样-相加"融合流，但将其末端的标准线性3x3平滑卷积替换为基于KAN的卷积层。该KAN层利用其优越的非线性建模能力，自适应学习和校正多尺度融合过程中产生的"伪影"。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的大量实验表明，KAN-FPN-Stem相比轻量级ViTPose-S基线实现了高达+2.0 AP的显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅提供了一个即插即用的高性能模块，更重要的是揭示了：ViT前端的性能瓶颈通常不在于"特征精炼"（注意力机制），而在于"特征融合"的质量，并通过引入KAN算子为解决这一瓶颈提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated significant promise in dense prediction tasks such as pose estimation. However, their performance is frequently constrained by the overly simplistic front-end designs employed in models like ViTPose. This naive patchification mechanism struggles to effectively handle multi-scale variations and results in irreversible information loss during the initial feature extraction phase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic "upsample-and-add" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the "artifacts" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion). Furthermore, it provides an effective path to address this bottleneck through the introduction of the KAN operator.

TL;DR: 提出MiG-DM模型，通过元信息引导的跨域协同扩散模型，结合患者特异性元信息和投影域物理知识，提升低剂量PET成像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量PET成像在减少患者辐射暴露方面至关重要，但面临噪声干扰、对比度降低和生理细节难以保留等挑战。现有方法往往忽略投影域物理知识和患者特异性元信息，而这些对于功能语义关联挖掘至关重要。

Method: 提出元信息引导的跨域协同扩散模型(MiG-DM)：1) 元信息编码模块将临床参数转化为语义提示，考虑患者特征、剂量相关信息和半定量参数，实现文本元信息与图像重建的跨模态对齐；2) 跨域架构结合投影域和图像域处理，在投影域使用专门的sinogram适配器通过卷积操作捕获全局物理结构。

Result: 在UDPET公共数据集和不同剂量水平的临床数据集上的实验表明，MiG-DM在提升PET图像质量和保留生理细节方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MiG-DM通过整合跨模态先验知识和跨域处理，有效解决了低剂量PET成像的挑战，为高质量PET图像生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: Low-dose PET imaging is crucial for reducing patient radiation exposure but faces challenges like noise interference, reduced contrast, and difficulty in preserving physiological details. Existing methods often neglect both projection-domain physics knowledge and patient-specific meta-information, which are critical for functional-semantic correlation mining. In this study, we introduce a meta-information guided cross-domain synergistic diffusion model (MiG-DM) that integrates comprehensive cross-modal priors to generate high-quality PET images. Specifically, a meta-information encoding module transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts by considering patient characteristics, dose-related information, and semi-quantitative parameters, enabling cross-modal alignment between textual meta-information and image reconstruction. Additionally, the cross-domain architecture combines projection-domain and image-domain processing. In the projection domain, a specialized sinogram adapter captures global physical structures through convolution operations equivalent to global image-domain filtering. Experiments on the UDPET public dataset and clinical datasets with varying dose levels demonstrate that MiG-DM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid knowledge distillation framework for developing a lightweight yet high-performance convolutional neural network. The proposed approach designs a customized student model that combines inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity and trains it under the guidance of a ResNet18 teacher network using a multi-objective strategy that integrates hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation. Experiments are conducted on a rice seed variety identification dataset containing nine varieties and further extended to four plant leaf disease datasets, including rice, potato, coffee, and corn, to evaluate generalization capability. On the rice seed variety classification task, the distilled student model achieves an accuracy of 98.56%, which is only 0.09% lower than the teacher model (98.65%), while requiring only 0.68 GFLOPs and approximately 1.07 million parameters. This corresponds to a reduction of about 2.7 times in computational cost and more than 10 times in model size compared with the ResNet18 teacher model. In addition, compared with representative pretrained models, the proposed student reduces the number of parameters by more than 6 times relative to DenseNet121 and by over 80 times compared with the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, while maintaining comparable or superior classification accuracy. Consistent performance gains across multiple plant leaf disease datasets further demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and strong deployment potential of the proposed framework for hardware-limited smart agriculture systems.

TL;DR: 提出自适应RGB-LWIR融合框架，在不同光照条件下动态选择最优检测模型，提升自主机器人在应急服务中的视觉性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测在低光环境下效果差，热成像系统缺乏颜色和纹理信息，需要一种能适应不同光照条件的鲁棒视觉系统

Method: 训练33个YOLO模型，使用超过22,000张标注图像，涵盖三种光照水平；通过11种融合比例（从100/0到0/100）融合对齐的RGB和LWIR帧；动态选择最优检测模型

Result: 最佳全光模型（80/20 RGB-LWIR）和暗光模型（90/10融合）分别达到92.8%和92.0%平均置信度，显著优于YOLOv5n和YOLOv11n基线；无光条件下最佳40/60融合达到71.0%

Conclusion: 自适应RGB-LWIR融合提高了所有光照条件下的检测置信度和可靠性，增强了自主机器人视觉性能，为应急服务中的搜索救援等任务提供了更鲁棒的解决方案

Abstract: Autonomous robotic platforms are playing a growing role across the emergency services sector, supporting missions such as search and rescue operations in disaster zones and reconnaissance. However, traditional red-green-blue (RGB) detection pipelines struggle in low-light environments, and thermal-based systems lack color and texture information. To overcome these limitations, we present an adaptive framework that fuses RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) video streams at multiple fusion ratios and dynamically selects the optimal detection model for each illumination condition. We trained 33 You Only Look Once (YOLO) models on over 22,000 annotated images spanning three light levels: no-light (<10 lux), dim-light (10-1000 lux), and full-light (>1000 lux). To integrate both modalities, fusion was performed by blending aligned RGB and LWIR frames at eleven ratios, from full RGB (100/0) to full LWIR (0/100) in 10% increments. Evaluation showed that the best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR) and dim-light model (90/10 fusion) achieved 92.8% and 92.0% mean confidence; both significantly outperformed the YOLOv5 nano (YOLOv5n) and YOLOv11 nano (YOLOv11n) baselines. Under no-light conditions, the top 40/60 fusion reached 71.0%, exceeding baselines though not statistically significant. Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion improved detection confidence and reliability across all illumination conditions, enhancing autonomous robotic vision performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出使用轻量级判别器作为外部引导信号，通过人类感知嵌入（HPE）教师模型在文本到图像生成中引入几何理解，实现几何与风格的分离控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型虽然能生成高度详细的纹理，但主要依赖表面外观，难以遵循严格的几何约束，特别是在几何约束与文本提示的风格相冲突时。这反映了人类感知与当前生成模型之间的语义鸿沟。

Method: 使用在THINGS三元组数据集上训练的人类感知嵌入（HPE）教师模型，该模型捕捉人类对物体形状的敏感性。通过将该教师模型的梯度注入潜在扩散过程，实现几何与风格的可控分离。在三种架构上评估：Stable Diffusion v1.5（U-Net骨干）、流匹配模型SiT-XL/2和扩散变换器PixArt-Σ。

Result: 实验表明流模型在没有持续引导时倾向于回到默认轨迹。该方法实现了复杂三维形状（如Eames椅子）到冲突材料（如粉色金属）的零样本迁移。与无引导基线相比，语义对齐提高了约80%。

Conclusion: 小型教师模型可以可靠地指导大型生成系统，实现更强的几何控制和拓宽文本到图像合成的创意范围，无需专门训练即可引入几何理解。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate highly detailed textures, yet they often rely on surface appearance and fail to follow strict geometric constraints, particularly when those constraints conflict with the style implied by the text prompt. This reflects a broader semantic gap between human perception and current generative models. We investigate whether geometric understanding can be introduced without specialized training by using lightweight, off-the-shelf discriminators as external guidance signals. We propose a Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on the THINGS triplet dataset, which captures human sensitivity to object shape. By injecting gradients from this teacher into the latent diffusion process, we show that geometry and style can be separated in a controllable manner. We evaluate this approach across three architectures: Stable Diffusion v1.5 with a U-Net backbone, the flow-matching model SiT-XL/2, and the diffusion transformer PixArt-Σ. Our experiments reveal that flow models tend to drift back toward their default trajectories without continuous guidance, and we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of complex three-dimensional shapes, such as an Eames chair, onto conflicting materials such as pink metal. This guided generation improves semantic alignment by about 80 percent compared to unguided baselines. Overall, our results show that small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis.

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在静态场景中常产生几何变形和遮挡不一致的伪影，需要一种系统的方法来检测和量化这些视觉不一致性，以评估和改进视频生成质量。

Method: GeCo通过融合残差运动和深度先验，生成密集的一致性图来检测几何变形和遮挡不一致伪影。该方法基于几何基础，能够提供可解释的检测结果。

Abstract: We introduce GeCo, a geometry-grounded metric for jointly detecting geometric deformation and occlusion-inconsistency artifacts in static scenes. By fusing residual motion and depth priors, GeCo produces interpretable, dense consistency maps that reveal these artifacts. We use GeCo to systematically benchmark recent video generation models, uncovering common failure modes, and further employ it as a training-free guidance loss to reduce deformation artifacts during video generation.

TL;DR: 当前AI模型在骨科临床推理评估中表现两极分化：结构化选择题准确率超90%，但需要多模态整合的开放式任务准确率仅约60%，存在严重视觉理解缺陷和文本驱动幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学AI评估基准（如执业考试或精选案例）无法反映真实临床实践中所需的整合性多模态推理能力，需要开发更贴近真实患者护理的评估框架。

Method: 开发了Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark，包含1,245个来自真实骨科和运动医学病例的问题，评估模型在7个临床推理任务上的表现，包括知识回忆、文本图像解释、诊断生成、治疗计划和原理提供。评估了11个视觉语言模型和6个大语言模型。

Result: 模型表现存在显著任务差异：最先进模型在结构化多选题上准确率超90%，但在需要多模态整合的开放式任务上准确率仅约60%。VLM在医学图像解释方面存在严重局限，常出现文本驱动幻觉，忽略矛盾的视觉证据。医学专用微调模型相比通用模型没有明显优势。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型尚未具备复杂多模态临床推理能力，安全部署应限于支持性文本角色。未来在核心临床任务上的进步需要多模态整合和视觉理解的根本性突破。

Abstract: Background: The rapid integration of foundation models into clinical practice and public health necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their true clinical reasoning capabilities beyond narrow examination success. Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning. Their safe deployment should currently be limited to supportive, text-based roles. Future advancement in core clinical tasks awaits fundamental breakthroughs in multimodal integration and visual understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门用于评估视觉语言模型在胎儿超声成像中性能的基准测试Fetal-Gauge，包含4.2万张图像和9.3万个问答对，揭示了现有模型性能远低于临床需求（最佳模型仅55%准确率）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球超声技师短缺阻碍了胎儿健康监测，深度学习可提高效率但缺乏标准化评估基准。胎儿超声具有挑战性、操作者依赖性强且公开数据集有限，需要专门基准来推动该领域发展。

Method: 创建Fetal-Gauge基准，包含超过42,000张图像和93,000个问答对，涵盖解剖平面识别、解剖结构视觉定位、胎儿方位评估、临床视图符合性和临床诊断等任务。系统评估了包括通用和医疗专用模型在内的多个最先进视觉语言模型。

Result: 评估显示现有模型性能存在显著差距：最佳模型仅达到55%准确率，远低于临床要求。分析揭示了当前视觉语言模型在胎儿超声解释中的关键局限性。

Conclusion: Fetal-Gauge为产前护理中的多模态深度学习建立了严格基础，揭示了需要领域适应架构和专门训练方法的紧迫性，为解决全球医疗可及性挑战提供了途径。

Abstract: The growing demand for prenatal ultrasound imaging has intensified a global shortage of trained sonographers, creating barriers to essential fetal health monitoring. Deep learning has the potential to enhance sonographers' efficiency and support the training of new practitioners. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are particularly promising for ultrasound interpretation, as they can jointly process images and text to perform multiple clinical tasks within a single framework. However, despite the expansion of VLMs, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in fetal ultrasound imaging. This gap is primarily due to the modality's challenging nature, operator dependency, and the limited public availability of datasets. To address this gap, we present Fetal-Gauge, the first and largest visual question answering benchmark specifically designed to evaluate VLMs across various fetal ultrasound tasks. Our benchmark comprises over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs, spanning anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of anatomical structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs, including general-purpose and medical-specific models, and reveal a substantial performance gap: the best-performing model achieves only 55\% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Our analysis identifies critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation, highlighting the urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches. Fetal-Gauge establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing multimodal deep learning in prenatal care and provides a pathway toward addressing global healthcare accessibility challenges. Our benchmark will be publicly available once the paper gets accepted.

Built upon the Align3D 130 dataset, Uni4D employs a 3D text multi head attention and search model to optimize text to 3D retrieval through improved semantic alignment. The framework further strengthens cross modal alignment through three components: precise text to 3D retrieval, multi view 3D to image alignment, and image to text alignment for generating temporally consistent 4D assets. Experimental results demonstrate that Uni4D achieves high quality 3D retrieval and controllable 4D generation, advancing dynamic multimodal understanding and practical applications.

Result: 使用SirenPose训练的模型在时空一致性指标上相比先前方法有显著提升，在处理快速运动和复杂场景变化方面表现优异

Conclusion: SirenPose通过结合周期性激活和几何先验，有效提升了动态3D场景重建的时空一致性，特别是在快速运动和多目标场景中表现突出

Abstract: We propose SirenPose, a novel loss function that combines the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with geometric priors derived from keypoint structures to improve the accuracy of dynamic 3D scene reconstruction. Existing approaches often struggle to maintain motion modeling accuracy and spatiotemporal consistency in fast moving and multi target scenes. By introducing physics inspired constraint mechanisms, SirenPose enforces coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions. We further expand the training dataset to 600,000 annotated instances to support robust learning. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with SirenPose achieve significant improvements in spatiotemporal consistency metrics compared to prior methods, showing superior performance in handling rapid motion and complex scene changes.

Motivation: 车载驾驶员监控系统需要在计算能力、功耗和成本严格受限的条件下，低延迟地识别分心和疲劳相关行为。现有系统往往需要昂贵硬件，难以在低成本边缘设备上部署。

Method: 1) 紧凑的单帧视觉模型；2) 混淆感知标签设计以减少视觉相似误报；3) 时序决策头，仅在预测既自信又持续时才触发警报。系统覆盖17种行为类别，包括手机使用、饮食、吸烟、伸手、视线转移、乘客互动等。

Abstract: In-cabin Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) must recognize distraction- and drowsiness-related behaviors with low latency under strict constraints on compute, power, and cost. We present a single-camera in-cabin driver behavior recognition system designed for deployment on two low-cost edge platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-only) and Google Coral Edge TPU. The proposed pipeline combines (i) a compact per-frame vision model, (ii) a confounder-aware label design to reduce visually similar false positives, and (iii) a temporal decision head that triggers alerts only when predictions are both confident and sustained. The system covers 17 behavior classes, including multiple phone-use modes, eating/drinking, smoking, reaching behind, gaze/attention shifts, passenger interaction, grooming, control-panel interaction, yawning, and eyes-closed sleep. Training and evaluation use licensed datasets spanning diverse drivers, vehicles, and lighting conditions (details in Section 6), and we further validate runtime behavior in real in-vehicle tests. The optimized deployments achieve about 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 with INT8 inference (per-frame latency under 60 ms) and about 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, enabling real-time monitoring and stable alert generation on inexpensive hardware. Finally, we discuss how reliable in-cabin human-state perception can serve as an upstream input for human-centered vehicle intelligence, including emerging agentic vehicle concepts.

Motivation: 针对现实部署条件下深度伪造检测面临的挑战，需要鲁棒、概率校准良好且能提供透明证据的检测器，以应对各种反取证攻击。

Method: 采用双流架构：一个流使用预训练骨干编码语义内容，另一个流提取取证残差，通过轻量残差适配器融合；结合红队训练（最坏K种反取证技术）和测试时防御（低成本抖动注入）；使用浅层特征金字塔网络生成篡改热图。

Conclusion: 该方法为攻击感知检测提供了模块化、数据高效且实际可部署的基线，具有校准概率和可操作热图，在现实条件下表现优异。

Abstract: This work presents an attack-aware deepfake and image-forensics detector designed for robustness, well-calibrated probabilities, and transparent evidence under realistic deployment conditions. The method combines red-team training with randomized test-time defense in a two-stream architecture, where one stream encodes semantic content using a pretrained backbone and the other extracts forensic residuals, fused via a lightweight residual adapter for classification, while a shallow Feature Pyramid Network style head produces tamper heatmaps under weak supervision. Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics per batch, including JPEG realign and recompress, resampling warps, denoise-to-regrain operations, seam smoothing, small color and gamma shifts, and social-app transcodes, while test-time defense injects low-cost jitters such as resize and crop phase changes, mild gamma variation, and JPEG phase shifts with aggregated predictions. Heatmaps are guided to concentrate within face regions using face-box masks without strict pixel-level annotations. Evaluation on existing benchmarks, including standard deepfake datasets and a surveillance-style split with low light and heavy compression, reports clean and attacked performance, AUC, worst-case accuracy, reliability, abstention quality, and weak-localization scores. Results demonstrate near-perfect ranking across attacks, low calibration error, minimal abstention risk, and controlled degradation under regrain, establishing a modular, data-efficient, and practically deployable baseline for attack-aware detection with calibrated probabilities and actionable heatmaps.

Abstract: Accurate food nutrition estimation from single images is challenging due to the loss of 3D information. While depth-based methods provide reliable geometry, they remain inaccessible on most smartphones because of depth-sensor requirements. To overcome this challenge, we propose PortionNet, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that learns geometric features from point clouds during training while requiring only RGB images at inference. Our approach employs a dual-mode training strategy where a lightweight adapter network mimics point cloud representations, enabling pseudo-3D reasoning without any specialized hardware requirements. PortionNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on MetaFood3D, outperforming all previous methods in both volume and energy estimation. Cross-dataset evaluation on SimpleFood45 further demonstrates strong generalization in energy estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多主体视频生成方法面临两个主要挑战：1）尺度不一致性 - 不同主体尺寸变化导致生成不自然；2）排列敏感性 - 参考图像输入顺序变化导致主体扭曲。这些问题影响了生成视频的质量和实用性。

Conclusion: MoFu有效解决了多主体视频生成中的尺度不一致和排列敏感性问题，通过创新的尺度感知调制和傅里叶融合策略，实现了更自然、稳定的视频生成效果。

Abstract: Multi-subject video generation aims to synthesize videos from textual prompts and multiple reference images, ensuring that each subject preserves natural scale and visual fidelity. However, current methods face two challenges: scale inconsistency, where variations in subject size lead to unnatural generation, and permutation sensitivity, where the order of reference inputs causes subject distortion. In this paper, we propose MoFu, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For scale inconsistency, we introduce Scale-Aware Modulation (SMO), an LLM-guided module that extracts implicit scale cues from the prompt and modulates features to ensure consistent subject sizes. To address permutation sensitivity, we present a simple yet effective Fourier Fusion strategy that processes the frequency information of reference features via the Fast Fourier Transform to produce a unified representation. Besides, we design a Scale-Permutation Stability Loss to jointly encourage scale-consistent and permutation-invariant generation. To further evaluate these challenges, we establish a dedicated benchmark with controlled variations in subject scale and reference permutation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoFu significantly outperforms existing methods in preserving natural scale, subject fidelity, and overall visual quality.

TL;DR: VideoZoomer：一种新型代理框架，使多模态大语言模型能够在推理过程中动态控制视觉焦点，通过从低帧率概览到自主选择时刻获取高帧率片段的渐进式方法，提升长视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在长视频理解方面存在局限，主要受限于有限的上下文窗口。现有方法通常依赖均匀帧采样或静态预选，可能忽略关键证据且无法在推理过程中纠正初始选择错误。

Method: 提出VideoZoomer代理框架，从粗粒度低帧率概览开始，调用时间缩放工具在自主选择的时刻获取高帧率片段，以多轮交互方式逐步收集细粒度证据。采用两阶段训练策略：首先在蒸馏示例和反思轨迹的精选数据集上进行监督微调，然后通过强化学习进一步优化代理策略。

Result: 7B模型展现出多样复杂的推理模式，在广泛的长视频理解和推理基准测试中表现优异。能够持续超越现有开源模型，甚至在具有挑战性的任务上与专有系统相媲美，同时在减少帧预算下实现更高效的性能。

Conclusion: VideoZoomer通过动态控制视觉焦点和渐进式证据收集，有效解决了长视频理解中的关键挑战，为多模态大语言模型在视频分析领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks yet remain limited in long video understanding due to the limited context window. Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.

TL;DR: SpotEdit是一个无需训练的图像编辑框架，通过选择性更新修改区域来减少冗余计算，提高编辑效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散Transformer模型在图像编辑时对所有token进行统一处理和去噪，即使只有小区域需要修改，这导致冗余计算并可能破坏未改变区域的质量。

Method: SpotEdit包含两个核心组件：SpotSelector通过感知相似性识别稳定区域并重用条件图像特征跳过计算；SpotFusion通过动态融合机制自适应地混合这些特征与编辑token，保持上下文连贯性。

Result: 通过减少不必要的计算并保持未修改区域的高保真度，SpotEdit实现了高效精确的图像编辑。

Conclusion: SpotEdit证明了在图像编辑中不需要重新生成每个区域，通过选择性更新修改区域可以显著提高效率和质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models have significantly advanced image editing by encoding conditional images and integrating them into transformer layers. However, most edits involve modifying only small regions, while current methods uniformly process and denoise all tokens at every timestep, causing redundant computation and potentially degrading unchanged areas. This raises a fundamental question: Is it truly necessary to regenerate every region during editing? To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions. SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality. By reducing unnecessary computation and maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas, SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeMoGen是一个基于能量扩散模型的运动分解训练范式，能够将复杂运动分解为语义上有意义的子组件，并支持运动概念的灵活重组生成新运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注前向建模（如从文本到运动的整体映射），而本文考虑逆视角：将整体运动分解为语义上有意义的子组件，以发现可重用的运动基元。

Method: 提出DeMoGen组合训练范式，采用基于能量的扩散模型直接捕捉多个运动概念的组合分布。引入三种训练变体：1）DeMoGen-Exp使用分解的文本提示进行显式训练；2）DeMoGen-OSS进行正交自监督分解；3）DeMoGen-SC强制原始文本嵌入和分解文本嵌入之间的语义一致性。

Conclusion: DeMoGen提供了一种有效的运动分解学习范式，不仅能够发现运动基元，还能支持运动概念的创造性重组，为文本到运动生成和运动组合提供了扩展资源。

Abstract: Human motions are compositional: complex behaviors can be described as combinations of simpler primitives. However, existing approaches primarily focus on forward modeling, e.g., learning holistic mappings from text to motion or composing a complex motion from a set of motion concepts. In this paper, we consider the inverse perspective: decomposing a holistic motion into semantically meaningful sub-components. We propose DeMoGen, a compositional training paradigm for decompositional learning that employs an energy-based diffusion model. This energy formulation directly captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts, enabling the model to discover them without relying on ground-truth motions for individual concepts. Within this paradigm, we introduce three training variants to encourage a decompositional understanding of motion: 1. DeMoGen-Exp explicitly trains on decomposed text prompts; 2. DeMoGen-OSS performs orthogonal self-supervised decomposition; 3. DeMoGen-SC enforces semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings. These variants enable our approach to disentangle reusable motion primitives from complex motion sequences. We also demonstrate that the decomposed motion concepts can be flexibly recombined to generate diverse and novel motions, generalizing beyond the training distribution. Additionally, we construct a text-decomposed dataset to support compositional training, serving as an extended resource to facilitate text-to-motion generation and motion composition.

Abstract: Non-invasive inference of molecular tumor characteristics from medical imaging is a central goal of radiogenomics, particularly in glioblastoma (GBM), where O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation carries important prognostic and therapeutic significance. Although radiomics-based machine learning methods have shown promise for this task, conventional unimodal and early-fusion approaches are often limited by high feature redundancy and an incomplete modeling of modality-specific information. In this work, we introduce a multi-view latent representation learning framework based on variational autoencoders (VAE) to integrate complementary radiomic features derived from post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By encoding each modality through an independent probabilistic encoder and performing fusion in a compact latent space, the proposed approach preserves modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration. The resulting latent embeddings are subsequently used for MGMT promoter methylation classification.

TL;DR: 提出基于视觉Transformer的端到端管道，联合分析H&E和IHC染色图像，实现像素级HER2评分（0,1+,2+,3+）自动标注

Motivation: 现有HER2评分方法难以提供像素级定位，且联合分析H&E和IHC图像具有挑战性，需要更准确的HER2蛋白表达评估来指导癌症治疗

Method: 使用视觉Transformer端到端管道：1) 对H&E全切片图像进行分块处理定位肿瘤区域；2) 提出新颖映射函数关联IHC图像中对应恶性区域；3) 嵌入临床启发的HER2评分机制，实现4级像素级自动标注

Conclusion: 基于ViT的端到端模型能有效联合评估H&E和IHC图像进行HER2评分，展示了在临床病理分析中的实用性

Abstract: The popular use of histopathology images, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), has proven to be useful in detecting tumors. However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring

TL;DR: 感知启发的伪着色技术能提升ECG分析中深度神经网络的解释性和少样本学习能力，在数据稀缺情况下实现更好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器视觉模型（特别是深度神经网络）在生理信号解释（如心电图）中需要大量训练数据，且缺乏对预测背后因果特征的理解，这限制了临床可靠性和与人类推理的一致性。

Method: 采用感知启发的伪着色技术，将临床显著的时间特征（如QT间期）编码为结构化颜色表示；使用原型网络和ResNet-18架构，评估单次心跳和完整10秒节律ECG图像的单样本和少样本学习。

Result: 伪着色技术使模型能从仅1-5个训练样本中学习判别性和可解释的特征；解释性分析显示该方法能引导注意力关注临床相关的ECG特征，同时抑制无关信号成分；聚合多个心跳周期可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 人类感知编码能弥合医学机器智能中的数据效率、可解释性和因果推理之间的差距，为数据稀缺的临床场景提供更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine vision models, particularly deep neural networks, are increasingly applied to physiological signal interpretation, including electrocardiography (ECG), yet they typically require large training datasets and offer limited insight into the causal features underlying their predictions. This lack of data efficiency and interpretability constrains their clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning. Here, we show that a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique, previously demonstrated to enhance human ECG interpretation, can improve both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks analysing complex physiological data.
  We focus on acquired, drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a challenging case study characterised by heterogeneous signal morphology, variable heart rate, and scarce positive cases associated with life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This setting provides a stringent test of model generalisation under extreme data scarcity. By encoding clinically salient temporal features, such as QT-interval duration, into structured colour representations, models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as one or five training examples. Using prototypical networks and a ResNet-18 architecture, we evaluate one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images derived from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms. Explainability analyses show that pseudo-colouring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant signal components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance, mirroring human perceptual averaging across heartbeats. Together, these findings demonstrate that human-like perceptual encoding can bridge data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical machine intelligence.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in 2D vision-language tasks, their application to complex 3D scene manipulation remains underexplored. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines. Website: vulcan-3d.github.io

Motivation: 传统扩散或流模型依赖局部监督需要多步推理，蒸馏方法需要预训练教师模型。Self-E旨在填补这两个范式之间的空白，实现从零开始训练、支持任意步数的高质量文本到图像生成。

Method: Self-E采用流匹配式数据学习，同时引入新颖的自评估机制：使用当前分数估计评估自身生成的样本，作为动态自教师。结合瞬时局部学习和自驱动的全局匹配。

Result: 在大规模文本到图像基准测试中，Self-E在少步生成中表现出色，在50步时与最先进的流匹配模型竞争。性能随推理步数增加单调提升，支持从超快速少步到高质量长轨迹采样的统一模型。

Conclusion: Self-E是第一个从零开始、支持任意步数的文本到图像模型，为高效可扩展生成提供了统一框架，填补了传统扩散/流模型与蒸馏方法之间的空白。

Abstract: We introduce the Self-Evaluating Model (Self-E), a novel, from-scratch training approach for text-to-image generation that supports any-step inference. Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model. To our knowledge, Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model, offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation.

Abstract: Accurate, up-to-date sidewalk data is essential for building accessible and inclusive pedestrian infrastructure, yet current approaches to data collection are often costly, fragmented, and difficult to scale. We introduce iOSPointMapper, a mobile application that enables real-time, privacy-conscious sidewalk mapping on the ground, using recent-generation iPhones and iPads. The system leverages on-device semantic segmentation, LiDAR-based depth estimation, and fused GPS/IMU data to detect and localize sidewalk-relevant features such as traffic signs, traffic lights and poles. To ensure transparency and improve data quality, iOSPointMapper incorporates a user-guided annotation interface for validating system outputs before submission. Collected data is anonymized and transmitted to the Transportation Data Exchange Initiative (TDEI), where it integrates seamlessly with broader multimodal transportation datasets. Detailed evaluations of the system's feature detection and spatial mapping performance reveal the application's potential for enhanced pedestrian mapping. Together, these capabilities offer a scalable and user-centered approach to closing critical data gaps in pedestrian

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeFloMat提出了一种基于条件流匹配的生成式目标检测框架，通过确定性流场替代扩散模型的随机去噪过程，在仅需3步推理的情况下实现了43.32% AP10:50的SOTA精度，解决了扩散检测器在临床应用中延迟过高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于扩散的目标检测器（如DiffusionDet）在时间敏感的临床应用中存在的延迟瓶颈问题。扩散模型虽然精度高，但需要大量采样步骤（T>>60），这在克罗恩病磁共振肠造影等临床应用中不实用。

Method: 提出DeFloMat框架，将条件流匹配（CFM）集成到目标检测中，用基于条件最优传输理论的确定性流场替代扩散模型的随机去噪路径，具体近似整流流，通过简单的ODE求解器实现快速推理。

Result: 在MRE临床数据集上，DeFloMat仅用3步推理就达到43.32% AP10:50的SOTA精度，比DiffusionDet在4步时的最佳性能（31.03% AP10:50）提升1.4倍。确定性流显著改善了定位特性，在少步情况下实现了更好的召回率和稳定性。

Conclusion: DeFloMat解决了生成式检测精度与临床效率之间的权衡问题，为稳定快速的目标定位设定了新标准，特别适用于时间敏感的医疗应用场景。

Abstract: We propose DeFloMat (Detection with Flow Matching), a novel generative object detection framework that addresses the critical latency bottleneck of diffusion-based detectors, such as DiffusionDet, by integrating Conditional Flow Matching (CFM). Diffusion models achieve high accuracy by formulating detection as a multi-step stochastic denoising process, but their reliance on numerous sampling steps ($T \gg 60$) makes them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications like Crohn's Disease detection in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE). DeFloMat replaces this slow stochastic path with a highly direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport (OT) theory, specifically approximating the Rectified Flow. This shift enables fast inference via a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver. We demonstrate the superiority of DeFloMat on a challenging MRE clinical dataset. Crucially, DeFloMat achieves state-of-the-art accuracy ($43.32\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$) in only $3$ inference steps, which represents a $1.4\times$ performance improvement over DiffusionDet's maximum converged performance ($31.03\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$ at $4$ steps). Furthermore, our deterministic flow significantly enhances localization characteristics, yielding superior Recall and stability in the few-step regime. DeFloMat resolves the trade-off between generative accuracy and clinical efficiency, setting a new standard for stable and rapid object localization.

Abstract: Label-free 3D brightfield microscopy offers a fast and noninvasive way to visualize cellular morphology, yet robust volumetric segmentation still typically depends on fluorescence or heavy post-processing. We address this gap by introducing Bright-4B, a 4 billion parameter foundation model that learns on the unit hypersphere to segment subcellular structures directly from 3D brightfield volumes. Bright-4B combines a hardware-aligned Native Sparse Attention mechanism (capturing local, coarse, and selected global context), depth-width residual HyperConnections that stabilize representation flow, and a soft Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive capacity. A plug-and-play anisotropic patch embed further respects confocal point-spread and axial thinning, enabling geometry-faithful 3D tokenization. The resulting model produces morphology-accurate segmentations of nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles from brightfield stacks alone--without fluorescence, auxiliary channels, or handcrafted post-processing. Across multiple confocal datasets, Bright-4B preserves fine structural detail across depth and cell types, outperforming contemporary CNN and Transformer baselines. All code, pretrained weights, and models for downstream finetuning will be released to advance large-scale, label-free 3D cell mapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放疗通量图预测是自动化放疗计划的核心，但由于解剖结构与束流强度调制之间的复杂关系，这仍然是一个不适定逆问题。传统卷积方法难以捕捉长程依赖，导致结构不一致或物理不可行的计划。

Method: 提出FluenceFormer，一个骨干网络无关的Transformer框架，采用统一的两阶段设计：第一阶段从解剖输入预测全局剂量先验，第二阶段将该先验与显式束流几何条件结合，回归物理校准的通量图。核心是Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR)损失函数，整合了体素级保真度、梯度平滑性、结构一致性和束流级能量守恒。

Result: 在多个Transformer骨干网络（Swin UNETR、UNETR、nnFormer、MedFormer）上评估，使用前列腺IMRT数据集。FluenceFormer与Swin UNETR组合表现最佳，相比现有CNN和单阶段基准方法，将能量误差降低至4.5%，并在结构保真度上获得统计学显著提升（p < 0.05）。

Conclusion: FluenceFormer框架通过两阶段Transformer架构和物理感知损失函数，有效解决了放疗通量图预测中的长程依赖问题，实现了更准确、物理一致的自动化放疗计划。

Abstract: Fluence map prediction is central to automated radiotherapy planning but remains an ill-posed inverse problem due to the complex relationship between volumetric anatomy and beam-intensity modulation. Convolutional methods in prior work often struggle to capture long-range dependencies, which can lead to structurally inconsistent or physically unrealizable plans. We introduce \textbf{FluenceFormer}, a backbone-agnostic transformer framework for direct, geometry-aware fluence regression. The model uses a unified two-stage design: Stage~1 predicts a global dose prior from anatomical inputs, and Stage~2 conditions this prior on explicit beam geometry to regress physically calibrated fluence maps. Central to the approach is the \textbf{Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR)} loss, a physics-informed objective that integrates voxel-level fidelity, gradient smoothness, structural consistency, and beam-wise energy conservation. We evaluate the generality of the framework across multiple transformer backbones, including Swin UNETR, UNETR, nnFormer, and MedFormer, using a prostate IMRT dataset. FluenceFormer with Swin UNETR achieves the strongest performance among the evaluated models and improves over existing benchmark CNN and single-stage methods, reducing Energy Error to $\mathbf{4.5\%}$ and yielding statistically significant gains in structural fidelity ($p < 0.05$).

Conclusion: EmoCtrl成功解决了内容一致性和情感表达之间的平衡问题，学习到的情感标记具有互补效应和良好泛化能力，为可控情感图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: An image conveys meaning through both its visual content and emotional tone, jointly shaping human perception. We introduce Controllable Emotional Image Content Generation (C-EICG), which aims to generate images that remain faithful to a given content description while expressing a target emotion. Existing text-to-image models ensure content consistency but lack emotional awareness, whereas emotion-driven models generate affective results at the cost of content distortion. To address this gap, we propose EmoCtrl, supported by a dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts, bridging abstract emotions to visual cues. EmoCtrl incorporates textual and visual emotion enhancement modules that enrich affective expression via descriptive semantics and perceptual cues. The learned emotion tokens exhibit complementary effects, as demonstrated through ablations and visualizations. Quantatitive and qualatitive experiments demonstrate that EmoCtrl achieves faithful content and expressive emotion control, outperforming existing methods across multiple aspects. User studies confirm EmoCtrl's strong alignment with human preference. Moreover, EmoCtrl generalizes well to creative applications, further demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of the learned emotion tokens.

Conclusion: 架构优化为提升LiDAR分辨率提供了一种计算高效的方法，无需额外的传感器硬件，通过光束感知图建模和门控融合机制有效重建缺失信息。

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in autonomous systems is constrained by fixed vertical beam resolution and further compromised by beam dropout resulting from environmental occlusions. This paper introduces SuperiorGAT, a graph attention-based framework designed to reconstruct missing elevation information in sparse LiDAR point clouds. By modeling LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs and incorporating gated residual fusion with feed-forward refinement, SuperiorGAT enables accurate reconstruction without increasing network depth. To evaluate performance, structured beam dropout is simulated by removing every fourth vertical scanning beam. Extensive experiments across diverse KITTI environments, including Person, Road, Campus, and City sequences, demonstrate that SuperiorGAT consistently achieves lower reconstruction error and improved geometric consistency compared to PointNet-based models and deeper GAT baselines. Qualitative X-Z projections further confirm the model's ability to preserve structural integrity with minimal vertical distortion. These results suggest that architectural refinement offers a computationally efficient method for improving LiDAR resolution without requiring additional sensor hardware.

Current event camera calibration methods typically involve using flashing patterns, reconstructing intensity images, and utilizing the features extracted from events. Existing methods are generally time-consuming and require manually placed calibration objects, which cannot meet the needs of rapidly changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a line-based event camera calibration framework exploiting the geometric lines of commonly-encountered objects in man-made environments, e.g., doors, windows, boxes, etc. Different from previous methods, our method detects lines directly from event streams and leverages an event-line calibration model to generate the initial guess of camera parameters, which is suitable for both planar and non-planar lines. Then, a non-linear optimization is adopted to refine camera parameters. Both simulation and real-world experiments have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of our method, with validation performed on monocular and stereo event cameras.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出QDFNet，一种质量感知动态融合网络，用于解决光学-SAR图像融合目标检测中模态缺失和退化问题，通过可学习参考令牌评估特征可靠性并指导自适应融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学和SAR融合目标检测面临实际部署困难，由于成像机制不同、时间异步和配准问题，难以获得对齐良好的图像对，经常导致模态缺失或退化。现有方法对随机缺失模态的鲁棒性有限，缺乏确保融合检测性能一致提升的有效机制。

Method: 提出QDFNet，包含两个核心模块：1) 动态模态质量评估(DMQA)模块，使用可学习参考令牌迭代优化特征可靠性评估，识别退化区域并提供质量指导；2) 正交约束归一化融合(OCNF)模块，使用正交约束保持模态独立性，同时基于可靠性分数动态调整融合权重，抑制不可靠特征传播。

Result: 在SpaceNet6-OTD和OGSOD-2.0数据集上的大量实验表明，QDFNet相比最先进方法具有优越性和有效性，特别是在部分模态损坏或缺失数据场景下。

Conclusion: QDFNet通过质量感知动态融合机制，有效解决了光学-SAR融合目标检测中的模态缺失和退化问题，提高了检测的鲁棒性和性能一致性。

Abstract: Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) fusion-based object detection has attracted significant research interest in remote sensing, as these modalities provide complementary information for all-weather monitoring. However, practical deployment is severely limited by inherent challenges. Due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, obtaining well-aligned optical-SAR image pairs remains extremely difficult, frequently resulting in missing or degraded modality data. Although recent approaches have attempted to address this issue, they still suffer from limited robustness to random missing modalities and lack effective mechanisms to ensure consistent performance improvement in fusion-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet) for robust optical-SAR object detection. Our proposed method leverages learnable reference tokens to dynamically assess feature reliability and guide adaptive fusion in the presence of missing modalities. In particular, we design a Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) module that employs learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment, enabling precise identification of degraded regions and providing quality guidance for subsequent fusion. Moreover, we develop an Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) module that employs orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores, effectively suppressing unreliable feature propagation. Extensive experiments on the SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of QDFNet compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视障人士定位物体存在显著困难，这阻碍了他们的独立性，甚至可能导致危险情况。为了增强视障人士的自理能力，需要开发辅助工具减少对他人的依赖。

Method: 使用Flutter开发平台构建手机应用，后端采用Efficientdet-D2模型进行物体检测。通过耳机提供立体声音频提示：物体在右侧时右耳发出正弦波声音，在左侧时左耳发声，正前方时双耳同时发声。

Result: 开发了完整的SonoVision应用程序，能够通过声音提示帮助视障人士定位物体。应用支持完全离线工作，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Locating objects for the visually impaired is a significant challenge and is something no one can get used to over time. However, this hinders their independence and could push them towards risky and dangerous scenarios. Hence, in the spirit of making the visually challenged more self-sufficient, we present SonoVision, a smart-phone application that helps them find everyday objects using sound cues through earphones/headphones. This simply means, if an object is on the right or left side of a user, the app makes a sinusoidal sound in a user's respective ear through ear/headphones. However, to indicate objects located directly in front, both the left and right earphones are rung simultaneously. These sound cues could easily help a visually impaired individual locate objects with the help of their smartphones and reduce the reliance on people in their surroundings, consequently making them more independent. This application is made with the flutter development platform and uses the Efficientdet-D2 model for object detection in the backend. We believe the app will significantly assist the visually impaired in a safe and user-friendly manner with its capacity to work completely offline. Our application can be accessed here https://github.com/MohammedZ666/SonoVision.git.

Abstract: Monocular 3D building reconstruction from remote sensing imagery is essential for scalable urban modeling, yet existing methods often require task-specific architectures and intensive supervision. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of SAM 3D, a general-purpose image-to-3D foundation model, for monocular remote sensing building reconstruction. We benchmark SAM 3D against TRELLIS on samples from the NYC Urban Dataset, employing Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIP-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) as evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM 3D produces more coherent roof geometry and sharper boundaries compared to TRELLIS. We further extend SAM 3D to urban scene reconstruction through a segment-reconstruct-compose pipeline, demonstrating its potential for urban scene modeling. We also analyze practical limitations and discuss future research directions. These findings provide practical guidance for deploying foundation models in urban 3D reconstruction and motivate future integration of scene-level structural priors.

Abstract: Electrical substations are a significant component of an electrical grid. Indeed, the assets at these substations (e.g., transformers) are prone to disruption from many hazards, including hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, and geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). As electrical grids are considered critical national infrastructure, any failure can have significant economic and public safety implications. To help prevent and mitigate these failures, it is thus essential that we identify key substation components to quantify vulnerability. Unfortunately, traditional manual mapping of substation infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an autonomous solution utilizing computer vision models is preferable, as it allows for greater convenience and efficiency. In this research paper, we train and compare the outputs of 3 models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images. Each model is evaluated for detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency. We present the key strengths and limitations of each model, identifying which provides reliable and large-scale substation component mapping. Additionally, we utilize these models to effectively map the various substation components in the United States, showcasing a use case for machine learning in substation mapping.

TL;DR: PGR²M提出了一种混合表示方法，通过残差向量量化增强可解释的姿态编码，提升文本驱动的3D动作生成和编辑质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于姿态编码的框架（如CoMo）虽然支持可解释的动作控制，但其逐帧表示难以捕捉细微的时序动态和高频细节，导致重建保真度和局部可控性下降。

Method: 提出姿态引导的残差细化表示（PGR²M）：1）姿态引导的RVQ分词器将动作分解为编码全局结构的姿态潜在变量和编码细粒度时序变化的残差潜在变量；2）残差dropout防止过度依赖残差；3）基础Transformer自回归预测姿态编码，细化Transformer基于文本、姿态编码和量化阶段预测残差编码。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上，PGR²M在Fréchet inception距离和重建指标上优于CoMo及最近的扩散和分词基线方法，用户研究证实其能实现直观、结构保持的动作编辑。

Conclusion: PGR²M通过混合表示方法有效解决了现有姿态编码框架在时序动态捕捉方面的局限性，显著提升了文本驱动的3D动作生成和编辑的质量与可控性。

Abstract: Text-based 3D motion generation aims to automatically synthesize diverse motions from natural-language descriptions to extend user creativity, whereas motion editing modifies an existing motion sequence in response to text while preserving its overall structure. Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations. Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes. On top of this tokenizer, a base Transformer autoregressively predicts pose codes from text, and a refine Transformer predicts residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that PGR$^2$M improves Fréchet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for both generation and editing compared with CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines, while user studies confirm that it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of shock wave motion parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution is essential for applications such as power field testing and damage assessment. However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-precision measurement of the shock wave motion field with both high spatial and temporal resolution, representing significant progress.

Conclusion: 提出的分层MoE适配器和两阶段半监督范式有效解决了红外小目标检测中的标注成本问题，为使用SAM作为教师模型进行知识蒸馏提供了新方法

Abstract: Infrared small object detection urgently requires semi-supervised paradigms due to the high cost of annotation. However, existing methods like SAM face significant challenges of domain gaps, inability of encoding physical priors, and inherent architectural complexity. To address this, we designed a Hierarchical MoE Adapter consisting of four white-box neural operators. Building upon this core component, we propose a two-stage paradigm for knowledge distillation and transfer: (1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation, where we use our MoE adapter and 10% of available fully supervised data to distill SAM into an expert teacher (Scalpel-SAM); and (2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer, where we use Scalpel-SAM to generate pseudo labels for training lightweight and efficient downstream models. Experiments demonstrate that with minimal annotations, our paradigm enables downstream models to achieve performance comparable to, or even surpassing, their fully supervised counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised paradigm that systematically addresses the data scarcity issue in IR-SOT using SAM as the teacher model.

Method: 提出Video Gaussian Masked Autoencoders (Video-GMAE)，将图像序列编码为随时间移动的高斯泼溅集合，使用掩码自编码器架构进行自监督预训练

Conclusion: Video-GMAE通过将视频表示为动态高斯集合，有效学习视频表示并自然涌现跟踪能力，为自监督视频理解提供了新思路

Abstract: We propose Video Gaussian Masked Autoencoders (Video-GMAE), a self-supervised approach for representation learning that encodes a sequence of images into a set of Gaussian splats moving over time. Representing a video as a set of Gaussians enforces a reasonable inductive bias: that 2-D videos are often consistent projections of a dynamic 3-D scene. We find that tracking emerges when pretraining a network with this architecture. Mapping the trajectory of the learnt Gaussians onto the image plane gives zero-shot tracking performance comparable to state-of-the-art. With small-scale finetuning, our models achieve 34.6% improvement on Kinetics, and 13.1% on Kubric datasets, surpassing existing self-supervised video approaches.

Abstract: Reliable and precise detection of small and irregular objects, such as meteor fragments and rocks, is critical for autonomous navigation and operation in lunar surface exploration. Existing multimodal 3D perception methods designed for terrestrial autonomous driving often underperform in off world environments due to poor feature alignment, limited multimodal synergy, and weak small object detection. This paper presents SCAFusion, a multimodal 3D object detection model tailored for lunar robotic missions. Built upon the BEVFusion framework, SCAFusion integrates a Cognitive Adapter for efficient camera backbone tuning, a Contrastive Alignment Module to enhance camera LiDAR feature consistency, a Camera Auxiliary Training Branch to strengthen visual representation, and most importantly, a Section aware Coordinate Attention mechanism explicitly designed to boost the detection performance of small, irregular targets. With negligible increase in parameters and computation, our model achieves 69.7% mAP and 72.1% NDS on the nuScenes validation set, improving the baseline by 5.0% and 2.7%, respectively. In simulated lunar environments built on Isaac Sim, SCAFusion achieves 90.93% mAP, outperforming the baseline by 11.5%, with notable gains in detecting small meteor like obstacles.

Abstract: Recently unified generation and editing models have achieved remarkable success with their impressive performance. These models rely mainly on text prompts for instruction-based editing and generation, but language often fails to capture users intended edit locations and fine-grained visual details. To this end, we propose two tasks: scribble-based editing and generation, that enables more flexible creation on graphical user interface (GUI) combining user textual, images, and freehand sketches. We introduce DreamOmni3, tackling two challenges: data creation and framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline includes two parts: scribble-based editing and generation. For scribble-based editing, we define four tasks: scribble and instruction-based editing, scribble and multimodal instruction-based editing, image fusion, and doodle editing. Based on DreamOmni2 dataset, we extract editable regions and overlay hand-drawn boxes, circles, doodles or cropped image to construct training data. For scribble-based generation, we define three tasks: scribble and instruction-based generation, scribble and multimodal instruction-based generation, and doodle generation, following similar data creation pipelines. For the framework, instead of using binary masks, which struggle with complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions, we propose a joint input scheme that feeds both the original and scribbled source images into the model, using different colors to distinguish regions and simplify processing. By applying the same index and position encodings to both images, the model can precisely localize scribbled regions while maintaining accurate editing. Finally, we establish comprehensive benchmarks for these tasks to promote further research. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamOmni3 achieves outstanding performance, and models and code will be publicly released.

Conclusion: CoAgent通过协作闭环框架有效解决了视频生成中的连贯性问题，为开放域视频生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Maintaining narrative coherence and visual consistency remains a central challenge in open-domain video generation. Existing text-to-video models often treat each shot independently, resulting in identity drift, scene inconsistency, and unstable temporal structure. We propose CoAgent, a collaborative and closed-loop framework for coherent video generation that formulates the process as a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline. Given a user prompt, style reference, and pacing constraints, a Storyboard Planner decomposes the input into structured shot-level plans with explicit entities, spatial relations, and temporal cues. A Global Context Manager maintains entity-level memory to preserve appearance and identity consistency across shots. Each shot is then generated by a Synthesis Module under the guidance of a Visual Consistency Controller, while a Verifier Agent evaluates intermediate results using vision-language reasoning and triggers selective regeneration when inconsistencies are detected. Finally, a pacing-aware editor refines temporal rhythm and transitions to match the desired narrative flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoAgent significantly improves coherence, visual consistency, and narrative quality in long-form video generation.

Motivation: 现有多模态LLM经常产生流畅但不可靠的推理，表现出弱的步骤间一致性和不足的视觉基础性。这是因为现有的对齐方法只监督最终答案，而忽略了中间推理过程的可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs often produce fluent yet unreliable reasoning, exhibiting weak step-to-step coherence and insufficient visual grounding, largely because existing alignment approaches supervise only the final answer while ignoring the reliability of the intermediate reasoning process. We introduce SR-MCR, a lightweight and label-free framework that aligns reasoning by exploiting intrinsic process signals derived directly from model outputs. Five self-referential cues -- semantic alignment, lexical fidelity, non-redundancy, visual grounding, and step consistency -- are integrated into a normalized, reliability-weighted reward that provides fine-grained process-level guidance. A critic-free GRPO objective, enhanced with a confidence-aware cooling mechanism, further stabilizes training and suppresses trivial or overly confident generations. Built on Qwen2.5-VL, SR-MCR improves both answer accuracy and reasoning coherence across a broad set of visual benchmarks; among open-source models of comparable size, SR-MCR-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 81.4%. Ablation studies confirm the independent contributions of each reward term and the cooling module.

To address these challenges, we propose novel techniques utilizing multi-parametric MRI data to enhance tumor segmentation and classification efficiency. Our work introduces the first-ever radiomics-enhanced fused residual multiparametric 3D network (ReFRM3D) for brain tumor characterization, which is based on a 3D U-Net architecture and features multi-scale feature fusion, hybrid upsampling, and an extended residual skip mechanism. Additionally, we propose a multi-feature tumor marker-based classifier that leverages radiomic features extracted from the segmented regions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance across the BraTS2019, BraTS2020, and BraTS2021 datasets, achieving high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 94.04%, 92.68%, and 93.64% for whole tumor (WT), enhancing tumor (ET), and tumor core (TC) respectively in BraTS2019; 94.09%, 92.91%, and 93.84% in BraTS2020; and 93.70%, 90.36%, and 92.13% in BraTS2021.

TL;DR: KV-Tracker：通过缓存全局自注意力块的键值对，将多视角3D几何网络适配为实时6-DoF姿态跟踪和在线重建系统，实现15倍加速和27 FPS的高帧率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角3D几何网络虽然提供了强大的先验知识，但推理速度过慢，无法满足实时应用需求。需要一种方法能够利用这些网络的强大能力，同时实现实时性能。

Method: 1）快速选择和管理关键帧图像，通过π³网络进行场景或物体映射；2）缓存全局自注意力块的键值对作为唯一的场景表示；3）使用缓存的KV对进行在线跟踪，避免重新计算；4）模型无关的设计，可直接应用于现有多视角网络而无需重新训练。

Conclusion: KV-Tracker成功地将多视角3D几何网络适配为实时系统，通过创新的KV缓存策略实现了高效在线跟踪和重建，为实时SLAM和AR/VR应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D geometry networks offer a powerful prior but are prohibitively slow for real-time applications. We propose a novel way to adapt them for online use, enabling real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction of objects and scenes from monocular RGB videos. Our method rapidly selects and manages a set of images as keyframes to map a scene or object via $π^3$ with full bidirectional attention. We then cache the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs and use them as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This allows for up to $15\times$ speedup during inference without the fear of drift or catastrophic forgetting. Our caching strategy is model-agnostic and can be applied to other off-the-shelf multi-view networks without retraining. We demonstrate KV-Tracker on both scene-level tracking and the more challenging task of on-the-fly object tracking and reconstruction without depth measurements or object priors. Experiments on the TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic and OnePose datasets show the strong performance of our system while maintaining high frame-rates up to ${\sim}27$ FPS.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D talking head generation aims to produce lifelike facial animations precisely synchronized with speech. While considerable progress has been made in achieving high lip-synchronization accuracy, existing methods largely overlook the intricate nuances of individual speaking styles, which limits personalization and realism. In this work, we present a novel framework for personalized 3D talking head animation, namely "PTalker". This framework preserves speaking style through style disentanglement from audio and facial motion sequences and enhances lip-synchronization accuracy through a three-level alignment mechanism between audio and mesh modalities. Specifically, to effectively disentangle style and content, we design disentanglement constraints that encode driven audio and motion sequences into distinct style and content spaces to enhance speaking style representation. To improve lip-synchronization accuracy, we adopt a modality alignment mechanism incorporating three aspects: spatial alignment using Graph Attention Networks to capture vertex connectivity in the 3D mesh structure, temporal alignment using cross-attention to capture and synchronize temporal dependencies, and feature alignment by top-k bidirectional contrastive losses and KL divergence constraints to ensure consistency between speech and mesh modalities. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that PTalker effectively generates realistic, stylized 3D talking heads that accurately match identity-specific speaking styles, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The method used to measure relationships between face embeddings plays a crucial role in determining the performance of face clustering. Existing methods employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient instead of the cosine distance to enhance the measurement accuracy. However, these methods introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing Jaccard coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient that enhances the purity of neighboring nodes, thereby improving the reliability of similarity measurements. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the optimal number of neighbors (Top-K) remains challenging, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a Transformer-based prediction model that examines the relationships between the central node and its neighboring nodes near the Top-K to further enhance the reliability of similarity estimation. However, vanilla Transformer, when applied to predict relationships between nodes, often introduces noise due to their overemphasis on irrelevant feature relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT), instead of the vanilla Transformer, to eliminate noise and enhance the model's anti-noise capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, such as MS-Celeb-1M, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming existing methods and providing a more robust solution for face clustering.

Abstract: While autoregressive Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their sequential generation often limits their efficacy in complex visual planning and dynamic robotic control. In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1. We also validate that dVLMs surpass AR baselines on downstream tasks across different training objectives. We release both Dream-VL and Dream-VLA to facilitate further research in the community.

Abstract: \noindent Memory has become the central mechanism enabling robust visual object tracking in modern segmentation-based frameworks. Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones. Code is available at: https://github.com/HamadYA/SAM3_Tracking_Zoo. \textbf{This is a preprint. Some results are being finalized and may be updated in a future revision.}

Conclusion: Envision通过显式的目标约束和两阶段生成过程，解决了现有视觉规划方法的空间漂移和目标对齐问题，为具身智能体提供了可靠的视觉规划指导。

Abstract: Embodied visual planning aims to enable manipulation tasks by imagining how a scene evolves toward a desired goal and using the imagined trajectories to guide actions. Video diffusion models, through their image-to-video generation capability, provide a promising foundation for such visual imagination. However, existing approaches are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories conditioned on the initial observation without explicit goal modeling, thus often leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents. By explicitly constraining the generation with a goal image, our method enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout the generated trajectory. Specifically, Envision operates in two stages. First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome. Then, an Env-Goal Video Model, built upon a first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion model (FL2V), interpolates between the initial observation and the goal image, producing smooth and physically plausible video trajectories that connect the start and goal states. Experiments on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks demonstrate that Envision achieves superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines. The resulting visual plans can directly support downstream robotic planning and control, providing reliable guidance for embodied agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出FinPercep-RM细粒度感知奖励模型和CCL协同进化课程学习机制，解决ISR任务中传统IQA模型对局部失真不敏感导致的奖励欺骗问题，提升超分辨率图像的全局质量和局部真实感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IQA模型通常输出单一全局分数，对局部和细粒度失真极不敏感，导致ISR模型可能产生感知上不希望的伪影却获得虚假高分，造成奖励欺骗问题，使优化目标与感知质量不对齐。

Method: 1. 提出基于编码器-解码器架构的FinPercep-RM细粒度感知奖励模型，不仅提供全局质量分数，还生成感知退化图来空间定位和量化局部缺陷；2. 构建FGR-30k数据集训练该模型；3. 提出CCL协同进化课程学习机制，奖励模型和ISR模型同步进行课程学习，从简单到复杂逐步训练。

Conclusion: 通过FinPercep-RM细粒度感知奖励模型和CCL协同进化课程学习机制，成功解决了ISR任务中传统IQA模型的局限性，实现了更稳定、更有效的RLHF训练，提升了超分辨率图像的感知质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in image generation field guided by reward models to align human preferences. Motivated by this, adapting RLHF for Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks has shown promise in optimizing perceptual quality with Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model as reward models. However, the traditional IQA model usually output a single global score, which are exceptionally insensitive to local and fine-grained distortions. This insensitivity allows ISR models to produce perceptually undesirable artifacts that yield spurious high scores, misaligning optimization objectives with perceptual quality and results in reward hacking. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture. While providing a global quality score, it also generates a Perceptual Degradation Map that spatially localizes and quantifies local defects. We specifically introduce the FGR-30k dataset to train this model, consisting of diverse and subtle distortions from real-world super-resolution models. Despite the success of the FinPercep-RM model, its complexity introduces significant challenges in generator policy learning, leading to training instability. To address this, we propose a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) mechanism, where both the reward model and the ISR model undergo synchronized curricula. The reward model progressively increases in complexity, while the ISR model starts with a simpler global reward for rapid convergence, gradually transitioning to the more complex model outputs. This easy-to-hard strategy enables stable training while suppressing reward hacking. Experiments validates the effectiveness of our method across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods.

We report state-of-the-art performance in indoor benchmarks under constrained training conditions, and strong performance when applied to outdoor datasets. This work establishes autoregressive priors as a complementary family of geometry-aware generative models for depth estimation, highlighting advantages in data scalability, and adaptability to 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a key indicator of cardiac function and plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization. Model performance was also found to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly convolutional kernel sizes and normalization strategies. While this study focuses on echocardiography-based LVEF estimation, the insights gained regarding architectural design and training strategies may be applicable to a broader range of medical and non-medical video analysis tasks.

Abstract: In the big data era, the computer vision field benefits from large-scale datasets such as LAION-2B, LAION-400M, and ImageNet-21K, Kinetics, on which popular models like the ViT and ConvNeXt series have been pre-trained, acquiring substantial knowledge. However, numerous downstream tasks in specialized and data-limited scientific domains continue to pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Cluster Attention Adapter (CLAdapter), which refines and adapts the rich representations learned from large-scale data to various data-limited downstream tasks. Specifically, CLAdapter introduces attention mechanisms and cluster centers to personalize the enhancement of transformed features through distribution correlation and transformation matrices. This enables models fine-tuned with CLAdapter to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets, facilitating the models' adaptation from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios effectively. In addition, CLAdapter's unified interface design allows for seamless integration with multiple model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers, in both 2D and 3D contexts. Through extensive experiments on 10 datasets spanning domains such as generic, multimedia, biological, medical, industrial, agricultural, environmental, geographical, materials science, out-of-distribution (OOD), and 3D analysis, CLAdapter achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse data-limited scientific domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in unleashing the potential of foundation vision models via adaptive transfer.

We introduce CritiFusion, a novel inference-time framework that integrates a multimodal semantic critique mechanism with frequency-domain refinement to improve text-to-image consistency and detail. The proposed CritiCore module leverages a vision-language model and multiple large language models to enrich the prompt context and produce high-level semantic feedback, guiding the diffusion process to better align generated content with the prompt's intent. Additionally, SpecFusion merges intermediate generation states in the spectral domain, injecting coarse structural information while preserving high-frequency details. No additional model training is required. CritiFusion serves as a plug-in refinement stage compatible with existing diffusion backbones. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our method notably improves human-aligned metrics of text-to-image correspondence and visual quality. CritiFusion consistently boosts performance on human preference scores and aesthetic evaluations, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art reward optimization approaches. Qualitative results further demonstrate superior detail, realism, and prompt fidelity, indicating the effectiveness of our semantic critique and spectral alignment strategy.

Abstract: Motion prediction has been studied in different contexts with models trained on narrow distributions and applied to downstream tasks in human motion prediction and robotics. Simultaneously, recent efforts in scaling video prediction have demonstrated impressive visual realism, yet they struggle to accurately model complex motions despite massive scale. Inspired by the scaling of video generation, we develop autoregressive flow matching (ARFM), a new method for probabilistic modeling of sequential continuous data and train it on diverse video datasets to generate future point track locations over long horizons. To evaluate our model, we develop benchmarks for evaluating the ability of motion prediction models to predict human and robot motion. Our model is able to predict complex motions, and we demonstrate that conditioning robot action prediction and human motion prediction on predicted future tracks can significantly improve downstream task performance.

Abstract: This work proposes a multimodal diffeomorphic registration method using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Nonrigid registration algorithms exhibit tradeoffs between their accuracy, the computational complexity of their deformation model, and its proper regularization. In addition, they also assume intensity correlation in anatomically homologous regions of interest among image pairs, limiting their applicability to the monomodal setting. Unlike learning-based models, we propose an instance-specific framework that is not subject to high scan requirements for training and does not suffer performance degradation at inference time on modalities unseen during training. Our method exploits the potential of continuous-depth networks in the Neural ODE paradigm with structural descriptors, widely adopted as modality-agnostic metric models which exploit self-similarities on parameterized neighborhood geometries. We propose three different variants that integrate image-based or feature-based structural descriptors and nonstructural image similarities computed by local mutual information. We conduct extensive evaluations on different experiments formed by scan dataset combinations and show surpassing qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art baselines adequate for large or small deformations, and specific of multimodal registration. Lastly, we also demonstrate the underlying robustness of the proposed framework to varying levels of explicit regularization while maintaining low error, its suitability for registration at varying scales, and its efficiency with respect to other methods targeted to large-deformation registration.

Conclusion: SCPainter为自动驾驶仿真提供了统一的3D资产插入和新视角合成框架，能够生成多样化的训练数据，提升自动驾驶模型的鲁棒性和安全性。

Abstract: 3D Asset insertion and novel view synthesis (NVS) are key components for autonomous driving simulation, enhancing the diversity of training data. With better training data that is diverse and covers a wide range of situations, including long-tailed driving scenarios, autonomous driving models can become more robust and safer. This motivates a unified simulation framework that can jointly handle realistic integration of inserted 3D assets and NVS. Recent 3D asset reconstruction methods enable reconstruction of dynamic actors from video, supporting their re-insertion into simulated driving scenes. While the overall structure and appearance can be accurate, it still struggles to capture the realism of 3D assets through lighting or shadows, particularly when inserted into scenes. In parallel, recent advances in NVS methods have demonstrated promising results in synthesizing viewpoints beyond the originally recorded trajectories. However, existing approaches largely treat asset insertion and NVS capabilities in isolation. To allow for interaction with the rest of the scene and to enable more diverse creation of new scenarios for training, realistic 3D asset insertion should be combined with NVS. To address this, we present SCPainter (Street Car Painter), a unified framework which integrates 3D Gaussian Splat (GS) car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS. The 3D GS assets and 3D scene point clouds are projected together into novel views, and these projections are used to condition a diffusion model to generate high quality images. Evaluation on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the capability of our framework to enable 3D asset insertion and NVS, facilitating the creation of diverse and realistic driving data.

Abstract: Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal ultrasound finding that portends high rates of chromosomal abnormalities, structural malformations, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases. Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that performance improvements achieved by USF-MAE were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of decomposed 4D scene reconstruction from multi-view videos. Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation. Furthermore, we sample observations for training in a temporally ordered manner, enabling the streaming propagation of features over time and effectively avoiding local minima during the optimization process. Experimental results on several datasets show that the reconstruction quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长上下文多图像场景中的视觉token剪枝挑战，通过自适应预算分配和多样性平衡，在降低计算成本的同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have proven effective on various tasks. They typically encode visual inputs into Original Model sequences of tokens, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by the language model. However, the growing number of visual tokens greatly increases inference cost. Visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens. The inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool and then applies a Pareto selection procedure that balances diversity with text alignment. Extensive experiments show that our approach maintains strong performance in long context settings while significantly cutting down the number of visual tokens.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in visual recognition tasks, but redundant token representations limit their computational efficiency. Existing token merging and pruning strategies often overlook spatial continuity and neighbor relationships, resulting in the loss of local context. This paper proposes novel neighbor-aware token reduction methods based on Hilbert curve reordering, which explicitly preserves the neighbor structure in a 2D space using 1D sequential representations. Our method introduces two key strategies: Neighbor-Aware Pruning (NAP) for selective token retention and Merging by Adjacent Token similarity (MAT) for local token aggregation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing methods. This work highlights the importance of spatial continuity and neighbor structure, offering new insights for the architectural optimization of ViTs.

Abstract: Understanding semantics and dynamics has been crucial for embodied agents in various tasks. Both tasks have much more data redundancy than the static scene understanding task. We formulate the view selection problem as an active learning problem, where the goal is to prioritize frames that provide the greatest information gain for model training. To this end, we propose an active learning algorithm with Fisher Information that quantifies the informativeness of candidate views with respect to both semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks. This formulation allows our method to jointly handle semantic reasoning and dynamic scene modeling, providing a principled alternative to heuristic or random strategies. We evaluate our method on large-scale static images and dynamic video datasets by selecting informative frames from multi-camera setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves rendering quality and semantic segmentation performance, outperforming baseline methods based on random selection and uncertainty-based heuristics.

Conclusion: AGQG模块通过解决语义漂移问题，提供了更可靠的质量评估方法，有望成为未来IQA模型的关键组件

Abstract: Existing AGIQA models typically estimate image quality by measuring and aggregating the similarities between image embeddings and text embeddings derived from multi-grade quality descriptions. Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both "excellent" and "poor" grade descriptions while deviating from the "good" one. We refer to this phenomenon as "semantic drift", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks. Moreover, it also generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment, revealing its potential as a key component in future IQA models.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature. Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face significant image quality degradation under a low-latency budget, primarily due to accumulated truncation errors arising from the inability to capture high-curvature trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as EPD-Solver), a novel ODE solver that mitigates these errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each step. Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework. Initially, EPD-Solver optimizes a small set of learnable parameters via a distillation-based approach. We further propose a parameter-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning scheme that reformulates the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy. Unlike traditional methods that fine-tune the massive backbone, our RL approach operates strictly within the low-dimensional solver space, effectively mitigating reward hacking while enhancing performance in complex text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. In addition, our method is flexible and can serve as a plugin (EPD-Plugin) to improve existing ODE samplers.

Abstract: Vision-Language Tracking aims to continuously localize objects described by a visual template and a language description. Existing methods, however, are typically limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. In this work, we introduce the first global tracking framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (VPTracker), exploiting their powerful semantic reasoning to locate targets across the entire image space. While global search improves robustness and reduces drift, it also introduces distractions from visually or semantically similar objects. To address this, we propose a location-aware visual prompting mechanism that incorporates spatial priors into the MLLM. Specifically, we construct a region-level prompt based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary. This design retains the advantages of global tracking while effectively suppressing interference from distracting visual content. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly enhances tracking stability and target disambiguation under challenging scenarios, opening a new avenue for integrating MLLMs into visual tracking.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of medical images is a key technology in medical image analysis and clinical diagnosis, providing structural visualization support for disease assessment and surgical planning. Traditional methods are computationally expensive and prone to structural discontinuities and loss of detail in sparse slices, making it difficult to meet clinical accuracy requirements.To address these challenges, we propose an efficient 3D reconstruction method based on 3D Gaussian and tri-plane representations. This method not only maintains the advantages of Gaussian representation in efficient rendering and geometric representation but also significantly enhances structural continuity and semantic consistency under sparse slicing conditions. Experimental results on multimodal medical datasets such as US and MRI show that our proposed method can generate high-quality, anatomically coherent, and semantically stable medical images under sparse data conditions, while significantly improving reconstruction efficiency. This provides an efficient and reliable new approach for 3D visualization and clinical analysis of medical images.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection enables models to localize and recognize objects beyond a predefined set of categories and is expected to achieve recognition capabilities comparable to human performance. In this study, we aim to evaluate the performance of existing models on open-vocabulary object detection tasks under low-quality image conditions. For this purpose, we introduce a new dataset that simulates low-quality images in the real world. In our evaluation experiment, we find that although open-vocabulary object detection models exhibited no significant decrease in mAP scores under low-level image degradation, the performance of all models dropped sharply under high-level image degradation. OWLv2 models consistently performed better across different types of degradation, while OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, and Detic showed significant performance declines.

TL;DR: EgoReAct：首个自回归框架，从第一人称视角视频实时生成3D对齐的人类反应动作，解决了现有方法在因果生成和空间对齐方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类对第一人称视角输入具有适应性和上下文敏感的响应，但现有方法难以同时满足严格因果生成和精确3D空间对齐的双重要求。现有数据集（如ViMo）存在显著的空间不一致问题，例如动态动作总是与固定摄像头视频配对。

Method: 首先构建Human Reaction Dataset (HRD)解决数据稀缺和错位问题；然后提出EgoReAct框架：1）通过向量量化变分自编码器将反应动作压缩到紧凑的潜在空间；2）训练生成预训练变换器从视觉输入生成反应；3）在生成过程中融入3D动态特征（度量深度和头部动态）以增强空间基础。

Result: EgoReAct在真实性、空间一致性和生成效率方面显著优于现有方法，同时保持严格的因果生成。实验证明该方法能够实时生成3D对齐的人类反应动作。

Conclusion: EgoReAct是首个能够从第一人称视角视频流实时生成3D对齐人类反应动作的自回归框架，通过HRD数据集和创新的生成架构，成功解决了因果生成和空间对齐的挑战。

Abstract: Humans exhibit adaptive, context-sensitive responses to egocentric visual input. However, faithfully modeling such reactions from egocentric video remains challenging due to the dual requirements of strictly causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment. To tackle this problem, we first construct the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment by building a spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction dataset, as existing datasets (e.g., ViMo) suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between the egocentric video and reaction motion, e.g., dynamically moving motions are always paired with fixed-camera videos. Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods, while maintaining strict causality during generation. We will release code, models, and data upon acceptance.

*Hualie Jiang,Ziyang Song,Zhiqiang Lou,Rui Xu,Minglang Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA360将Depth Anything V2适配到全景深度估计，通过学习ViT骨干网的偏移参数实现尺度不变输出，结合环形填充消除接缝，在室内外基准测试中显著提升零样本泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景深度估计在室内场景已有广泛研究，但其在开放世界的零样本泛化能力远落后于透视图像。透视域得益于丰富的训练数据，因此将透视域能力迁移到全景域成为有吸引力的解决方案。

Method: 提出DA360，即全景适配版的Depth Anything V2。核心创新包括：1) 从ViT骨干网学习偏移参数，将模型的尺度-偏移不变输出转换为尺度不变估计，直接生成格式良好的3D点云；2) 在DPT解码器中集成环形填充，消除接缝伪影，确保空间连贯的深度图并尊重球形连续性。

Result: 在标准室内基准和新构建的室外数据集Metropolis上评估，DA360相比基础模型在室内外基准测试中分别实现超过50%和10%的相对深度误差降低。相比现有全景深度估计方法，DA360在三个测试数据集上相比PanDA实现约30%的相对误差改进，为零样本全景深度估计建立了新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DA360通过迁移学习策略有效提升了全景深度估计的零样本泛化能力，在室内外场景均取得显著性能提升，为零样本全景深度估计建立了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: Panoramic depth estimation provides a comprehensive solution for capturing complete $360^\circ$ environmental structural information, offering significant benefits for robotics and AR/VR applications. However, while extensively studied in indoor settings, its zero-shot generalization to open-world domains lags far behind perspective images, which benefit from abundant training data. This disparity makes transferring capabilities from the perspective domain an attractive solution. To bridge this gap, we present Depth Anything in $360^\circ$ (DA360), a panoramic-adapted version of Depth Anything V2. Our key innovation involves learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone, transforming the model's scale- and shift-invariant output into a scale-invariant estimate that directly yields well-formed 3D point clouds. This is complemented by integrating circular padding into the DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts, ensuring spatially coherent depth maps that respect spherical continuity. Evaluated on standard indoor benchmarks and our newly curated outdoor dataset, Metropolis, DA360 shows substantial gains over its base model, achieving over 50\% and 10\% relative depth error reduction on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, DA360 significantly outperforms robust panoramic depth estimation methods, achieving about 30\% relative error improvement compared to PanDA across all three test datasets and establishing new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwinTF3D：轻量级多模态融合方法，通过统一视觉和语言表示实现文本引导的3D医学图像分割，解决了现有模型缺乏语义理解和领域适应性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D分割框架主要依赖大规模标注数据的视觉学习，缺乏语义理解能力，难以适应新领域和临床任务，无法处理用户自定义的分割目标。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的视觉编码器提取体积特征，通过紧凑的文本编码器和高效融合机制将视觉与语言表示统一，实现自然语言提示与医学体积空间结构的语义对齐。

Result: 在BTCV数据集上实验表明，SwinTF3D在多个器官上获得有竞争力的Dice和IoU分数，对未见数据泛化良好，相比传统Transformer分割网络有显著效率提升。

Conclusion: SwinTF3D通过桥接视觉感知与语言理解，建立了实用且可解释的交互式文本驱动3D医学图像分割范式，为临床影像提供了更适应性强、资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent integration of artificial intelligence into medical imaging has driven remarkable advances in automated organ segmentation. However, most existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely exclusively on visual learning from large annotated datasets restricting their adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks. The lack of semantic understanding in these models makes them ineffective in addressing flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives. To overcome these limitations, we propose SwinTF3D, a lightweight multimodal fusion approach that unifies visual and linguistic representations for text-guided 3D medical image segmentation. The model employs a transformer-based visual encoder to extract volumetric features and integrates them with a compact text encoder via an efficient fusion mechanism. This design allows the system to understand natural-language prompts and correctly align semantic cues with their corresponding spatial structures in medical volumes, while producing accurate, context-aware segmentation results with low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that SwinTF3D achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores across multiple organs, despite its compact architecture. The model generalizes well to unseen data and offers significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks. Bridging visual perception with linguistic understanding, SwinTF3D establishes a practical and interpretable paradigm for interactive, text-driven 3D medical image segmentation, opening perspectives for more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions in clinical imaging.

Conclusion: KANO为图像超分辨率提供了透明结构化的潜在退化拟合表示，阐明了不同模型在表征复杂退化机制中的优缺点，为可解释超分辨率技术发展提供了有价值见解。

Abstract: The highly nonlinear degradation process, complex physical interactions, and various sources of uncertainty render single-image Super-resolution (SR) a particularly challenging task. Existing interpretable SR approaches, whether based on prior learning or deep unfolding optimization frameworks, typically rely on black-box deep networks to model latent variables, which leaves the degradation process largely unknown and uncontrollable. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem (KAT), we for the first time propose a novel interpretable operator, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), with the application to image SR. KANO provides a transparent and structured representation of the latent degradation fitting process. Specifically, we employ an additive structure composed of a finite number of B-spline functions to approximate continuous spectral curves in a piecewise fashion. By learning and optimizing the shape parameters of these spline functions within defined intervals, our KANO accurately captures key spectral characteristics, such as local linear trends and the peak-valley structures at nonlinear inflection points, thereby endowing SR results with physical interpretability. Furthermore, through theoretical modeling and experimental evaluations across natural images, aerial photographs, and satellite remote sensing data, we systematically compare multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) in handling complex sequence fitting tasks. This comparative study elucidates the respective advantages and limitations of these models in characterizing intricate degradation mechanisms, offering valuable insights for the development of interpretable SR techniques.

Motivation: 现有3D视觉定位方法依赖预定义的对象查找表来查询视觉语言模型进行对象定位推理，这限制了在未定义或未预见目标场景中的应用。需要解决开放世界场景中的3D视觉定位问题。

Method: 提出OpenGround框架，核心是主动认知推理模块，通过认知任务链进行类人目标感知，主动推理上下文相关对象，通过动态更新的对象查找表扩展视觉语言模型的认知范围。该方法既支持预定义类别，也支持开放世界类别。

Result: 在Nr3D数据集上取得竞争性性能，在ScanRefer数据集上达到最先进水平，在提出的OpenTarget数据集上实现17.6%的显著提升。OpenTarget数据集包含7000多个对象-描述对，专门用于评估开放世界场景。

Conclusion: OpenGround通过主动认知推理模块有效解决了现有方法依赖预定义对象查找表的局限性，实现了开放世界3D视觉定位，在多个数据集上表现出色，为开放世界场景应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to locate objects based on natural language descriptions in 3D scenes. Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

Motivation: 现有3D变化检测方法存在检测变化的空间不一致性问题，且无法明确分离变化前后的状态。需要解决这些限制来改进场景监控、探索和持续重建。

Method: 提出SCaR-3D框架：1）基于符号距离的2D差分模块；2）带投票和剪枝的多视图聚合，利用3DGS的一致性特性；3）持续场景重建策略，选择性更新动态区域同时保留未变化区域；4）创建CCS3D合成数据集支持受控评估。

Conclusion: SCaR-3D成功解决了3D变化检测中的空间不一致性和状态分离问题，通过创新的2D差分和多视图聚合方法实现了鲁棒的变化检测，同时开发的持续重建策略为场景监控和更新提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Change detection plays a vital role in scene monitoring, exploration, and continual reconstruction. Existing 3D change detection methods often exhibit spatial inconsistency in the detected changes and fail to explicitly separate pre- and post-change states. To address these limitations, we propose SCaR-3D, a novel 3D scene change detection framework that identifies object-level changes from a dense-view pre-change image sequence and sparse-view post-change images. Our approach consists of a signed-distance-based 2D differencing module followed by multi-view aggregation with voting and pruning, leveraging the consistent nature of 3DGS to robustly separate pre- and post-change states. We further develop a continual scene reconstruction strategy that selectively updates dynamic regions while preserving the unchanged areas. We also contribute CCS3D, a challenging synthetic dataset that allows flexible combinations of 3D change types to support controlled evaluations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves both high accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解现代视觉语言模型的架构特性如何影响实际视频处理系统的设计和实现，为构建稳健的视频分析管道提供工程指导。

Method: 采用架构导向的分析方法，首先总结共享的多模态基础（视觉标记化、Transformer注意力、指令跟随），然后详细描述每个模型的架构，最后将模型行为映射到系统约束。

Result: 识别出结构化输出可能语法正确但语义错误、模式验证仅限于结构而非几何正确性、人物标识符在当前提示约定中是帧局部的等重要系统约束。

Conclusion: 理解模型架构特性与实际系统约束之间的映射关系对于撰写可辩护的声明、设计稳健接口和规划评估至关重要，这些区分是工程实践中的关键考虑因素。

Abstract: This report provides an architecture-led analysis of two modern vision-language models (VLMs), Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct, and explains how their architectural properties map to a practical video-to-artifact pipeline implemented in the BodyLanguageDetection repository [1]. The system samples video frames, prompts a VLM to detect visible people and generate pixel-space bounding boxes with prompt-conditioned attributes (emotion by default), validates output structure using a predefined schema, and optionally renders an annotated video. We first summarize the shared multimodal foundation (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, and instruction following), then describe each architecture at a level sufficient to justify engineering choices without speculative internals. Finally, we connect model behavior to system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid while semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural (not geometric correctness), person identifiers are frame-local in the current prompting contract, and interactive single-frame analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON. These distinctions are critical for writing defensible claims, designing robust interfaces, and planning evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于两个仿射对应和已知垂直方向（来自IMU）来估计相对姿态（3DOF）和焦距的新求解器


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶、智能手机、无人机等应用中，相机常与IMU结合使用。IMU可提供相机垂直方向，从而将相对姿态从5DOF简化为3DOF。现有方法需要更多对应点或无法有效利用IMU信息。

Method: 1) 在已知垂直方向条件下，从两个仿射对应建立约束方程；2) 基于方程系统非平凡解的性质，推导出仅包含焦距和相对旋转角的四个方程；3) 使用多项式特征值方法求解焦距和相对旋转角

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的评估表明，该求解器性能优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够仅用两个仿射对应和IMU提供的垂直方向信息，有效估计相对姿态（3DOF）和焦距，性能优于现有方法

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to estimate the relative pose and focal length between two views with known intrinsic parameters except for an unknown focal length from two affine correspondences (ACs). Cameras are commonly used in combination with inertial measurement units (IMUs) in applications such as self-driving cars, smartphones, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The vertical direction of camera views can be obtained by IMU measurements. The relative pose between two cameras is reduced from 5DOF to 3DOF. We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle. Finally, the polynomial eigenvalue method is utilized to solve the problem of focal length and relative rotation angle. The proposed solver is evaluated using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our solver performs better than the existing state-of-the-art solvers.

TL;DR: 提出基于MedSAM分割引导的胸部X光分类流程，通过肺部分割掩码作为空间先验，研究不同掩码策略对多标签异常分类的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光自动分析面临疾病信号弱、数据集偏差和空间监督有限等挑战，医学图像分割基础模型MedSAM可提供解剖学先验，提高CXR分析的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 使用MedSAM作为肺部分割模块，在NIH CXR数据集上训练和评估深度卷积神经网络，研究原始图像、宽松掩码和紧密掩码三种策略对五种异常（肿块、结节、肺炎、水肿、纤维化）和正常病例分类的影响。

Result: MedSAM能生成解剖学合理的肺部分割掩码；掩码效果具有任务和架构依赖性：ResNet50在原始图像上表现最佳，宽松掩码在正常病例筛查上显著改善，紧密掩码降低异常分类性能但提高训练效率。

Conclusion: 肺部分割掩码应作为可控的空间先验，根据骨干网络和临床目标进行选择，而非统一应用，需在异常分类和正常筛查之间权衡。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is widely used for screening and diagnosing pulmonary abnormalities, yet automated interpretation remains challenging due to weak disease signals, dataset bias, and limited spatial supervision. Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context. These results suggest that lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人-物交互视频生成在数字人、电子商务、广告和机器人模仿学习中有广泛应用前景。现有方法存在两个关键限制：1) 缺乏有效的多视图信息注入机制，导致跨视图一致性差；2) 严重依赖精细的手部网格标注来建模交互遮挡。

Conclusion: ByteLoom通过创新的RCM-cache机制和渐进式训练策略，成功解决了HOI视频生成中的跨视图一致性和标注依赖问题，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) video generation has garnered increasing attention due to its promising applications in digital humans, e-commerce, advertising, and robotics imitation learning. However, existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) a lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view information of the object into the model, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method faithfully preserves human identity and the object's multi-view geometry, while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.

Conclusion: PathoSyn提供了一个数学原理化的流程，用于生成高保真患者特异性合成数据集，支持可解释的反事实疾病进展建模，为临床决策支持系统提供了受控的基准测试环境。

Abstract: We present PathoSyn, a unified generative framework for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image synthesis that reformulates imaging-pathology as a disentangled additive deviation on a stable anatomical manifold. Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity. The source code of this work will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Socially compliant navigation requires structured reasoning over dynamic pedestrians and physical constraints to ensure safe and interpretable decisions. However, existing social navigation datasets often lack explicit reasoning supervision and exhibit highly long-tailed action distributions, limiting models' ability to learn safety-critical behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce MUSON, a multimodal dataset for short-horizon social navigation collected across diverse indoor and outdoor campus scenes. MUSON adopts a structured five-step Chain-of-Thought annotation consisting of perception, prediction, reasoning, action, and explanation, with explicit modeling of static physical constraints and a rationally balanced discrete action space. Compared to SNEI, MUSON provides consistent reasoning, action, and explanation. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art Small Vision Language Models on MUSON shows that Qwen2.5-VL-3B achieves the highest decision accuracy of 0.8625, demonstrating that MUSON serves as an effective and reusable benchmark for socially compliant navigation.

Abstract: This research proposes "ForCM", a novel approach to forest cover mapping that combines Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) with Deep Learning (DL) using multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. The study explores several DL models, including UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, and ResNet50-Segnet, applied to high-resolution Sentinel-2 Level 2A satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest. The datasets comprise three collections: two sets of three-band imagery and one set of four-band imagery. After evaluation, the most effective DL models are individually integrated with the OBIA technique to enhance mapping accuracy. The originality of this work lies in evaluating different deep learning models combined with OBIA and comparing them with traditional OBIA methods. The results show that the proposed ForCM method improves forest cover mapping, achieving overall accuracies of 94.54 percent with ResUNet-OBIA and 95.64 percent with AttentionUNet-OBIA, compared to 92.91 percent using traditional OBIA. This research also demonstrates the potential of free and user-friendly tools such as QGIS for accurate mapping within their limitations, supporting global environmental monitoring and conservation efforts.

Abstract: Foundation models have been successful in natural language processing and computer vision because they are capable of capturing the underlying structures (foundation) of natural languages. However, in medical imaging, the key foundation lies in human anatomy, as these images directly represent the internal structures of the body, reflecting the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy. Yet, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often overlook these perspectives, limiting their ability to effectively learn anatomical features. To overcome the limitation, we built Lamps (learning anatomy from multiple perspectives via self-supervision) pre-trained on large-scale chest radiographs by harmoniously utilizing the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments across 10 datasets evaluated through fine-tuning and emergent property analysis demonstrate Lamps' superior robustness, transferability, and clinical potential when compared to 10 baseline models. By learning from multiple perspectives, Lamps presents a unique opportunity for foundation models to develop meaningful, robust representations that are aligned with the structure of human anatomy.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the key target tasks of interest in the context of civil and military applications. In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods. From these observations, we recognize the current challenges that remain to be overcome.

TL;DR: 提出一种数据导向的方法来缓解深度学习模型中的伪相关性，通过识别、中和、消除和更新四个步骤构建去偏流程，在图像和NLP基准上比标准ERM提高了20%以上的最差组准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型经常学习到与类别标签虚假相关但与预测任务无关的特征。现有方法通常需要标注潜在伪属性或基于经验假设过滤伪特征，但在现实数据中伪相关性复杂且难以捉摸，这些方法效果有限。

Conclusion: 通过识别、中和、消除和更新四个步骤构建的数据导向去偏流程能有效缓解深度学习模型中的伪相关性，在多个基准上显著提升了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning models are known to often learn features that spuriously correlate with the class label during training but are irrelevant to the prediction task. Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfactory performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spurious features based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spurious features by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model. By integrating the aforementioned identifying, neutralizing, eliminating and updating procedures, we build an effective pipeline for mitigating spurious correlation. Experiments on image and NLP debiasing benchmarks show an improvement in worst group accuracy of more than 20% compared to standard empirical risk minimization (ERM).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚物品检测面临两大挑战：1）时尚物品外观高度多样化带来的歧义性；2）物品子类别之间的相似性。传统检测器独立检测每个物品，无法利用时尚物品之间的上下文关系。

Method: 提出Holi-DETR（整体检测Transformer），在DETR框架中整合三种异构上下文信息：1）时尚物品间的共现概率关系；2）基于物品间空间布局的相对位置和大小关系；3）物品与人体关键点的空间关系。

Result: 实验表明，Holi-DETR相比原始DETR提升了3.6个百分点（pp）的平均精度（AP），相比更先进的Co-DETR提升了1.1 pp。

Conclusion: 通过利用多种上下文信息进行整体检测，Holi-DETR有效减少了时尚物品检测中的歧义性，显著提升了检测性能，证明了上下文信息在时尚物品检测中的重要性。

Abstract: Fashion item detection is challenging due to the ambiguities introduced by the highly diverse appearances of fashion items and the similarities among item subcategories. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Holistic Detection Transformer (Holi-DETR) that detects fashion items in outfit images holistically, by leveraging contextual information. Fashion items often have meaningful relationships as they are combined to create specific styles. Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models. In experiments, the proposed methods improved the performance of the vanilla DETR and the more recently developed Co-DETR by 3.6 percent points (pp) and 1.1 pp, respectively, in terms of average precision (AP).

TL;DR: 本文提出了M-ErasureBench多模态评估框架，用于系统评估概念擦除方法在文本提示、学习嵌入和反转潜在空间三种输入模态下的性能，并提出了IRECE方法来增强概念擦除的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法主要关注文本提示，忽视了图像编辑和个性化生成等实际应用中日益重要的其他输入模态（如学习嵌入和反转潜在空间），这些模态可能成为攻击面，导致已擦除的概念重新出现。

Method: 1) 提出M-ErasureBench多模态评估框架，在文本提示、学习嵌入和反转潜在空间三种模态下评估概念擦除方法，包括白盒和黑盒访问设置；2) 提出IRECE（推理时鲁棒性增强概念擦除）方法，通过交叉注意力定位目标概念并在去噪过程中扰动相关潜在空间。

Result: 现有方法在文本提示下表现良好，但在学习嵌入和反转潜在空间下基本失效，白盒设置下的概念再现率超过90%。IRECE方法能显著恢复鲁棒性，在最具挑战性的白盒潜在反转场景下将概念再现率降低达40%，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: M-ErasureBench是首个超越文本提示的全面概念擦除基准，结合IRECE方法为构建更可靠保护性生成模型提供了实用保障，揭示了多模态概念擦除的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models may generate harmful or copyrighted content, motivating research on concept erasure. However, existing approaches primarily focus on erasing concepts from text prompts, overlooking other input modalities that are increasingly critical in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can become attack surfaces, where erased concepts re-emerge despite defenses. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios. Our analysis shows that existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in the white-box setting. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), a plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during denoising. Experiments demonstrate that IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario, while preserving visual quality. To the best of our knowledge, M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts. Together with IRECE, our benchmark offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing. Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 红外气体泄漏检测面临重大挑战，因为气体羽流微弱、尺寸小、半透明且边界模糊，传统方法难以有效检测。

Conclusion: PEG-DRNet通过物理边缘混合气体动态路由网络有效解决了红外气体泄漏检测的挑战，在精度和计算效率上实现了最佳平衡，为环境监测和工业安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting infrared gas leaks is critical for environmental monitoring and industrial safety, yet remains difficult because plumes are faint, small, semitransparent, and have weak, diffuse boundaries. We present physics-edge hybrid gas dynamic routing network (PEG-DRNet). First, we introduce the Gas Block, a diffusion-convection unit modeling gas transport: a local branch captures short-range variations, while a large-kernel branch captures long-range propagation. An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses. These are transformed by a multi-scale edge perception module (MSEPM) into hierarchical edge features that reinforce boundaries. Finally, the content-adaptive sparse routing path aggregation network (CASR-PAN), with adaptive information modulation modules for fusion and self, selectively propagates informative features across scales based on edge and content cues, improving cross-scale discriminability while reducing redundancy. Experiments on the IIG dataset show that PEG-DRNet achieves an overall AP of 29.8\%, an AP$_{50}$ of 84.3\%, and a small-object AP of 25.3\%, surpassing the RT-DETR-R18 baseline by 3.0\%, 6.5\%, and 5.3\%, respectively, while requiring only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9 M parameters. The proposed PEG-DRNet achieves superior overall performance with the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming existing CNN and Transformer detectors in AP and AP$_{50}$ on the IIG and LangGas dataset.

TL;DR: GPS是一种新的迭代精炼方法，通过约束采样路径保持在数据流形上，解决了传统CFG在迭代精炼中的稳定性问题，显著提升了图像生成质量和语义对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于去噪-反演循环的迭代精炼方法在与标准无分类器引导（CFG）结合时存在根本性限制：CFG的外推性质会系统性地将采样路径推离数据流形，导致近似误差发散，破坏精炼过程。

Method: 提出引导路径采样（GPS）新范式，用原则性的流形约束插值替代不稳定的外推，确保采样路径保持在数据流形上。理论证明该方法能将误差序列从无界放大转变为严格有界。同时设计了最优调度策略，动态调整引导强度，使语义注入与模型从粗到细的生成过程对齐。

Result: 在SDXL和Hunyuan-DiT等现代骨干模型上的实验表明，GPS在感知质量和复杂提示遵循方面优于现有方法。例如，GPS在SDXL上实现了0.79的ImageReward和0.2995的HPS v2分数，同时在GenEval上将整体语义对齐准确率提升至57.45%。

Conclusion: 路径稳定性是有效迭代精炼的前提条件，GPS提供了一个稳健的框架来实现这一目标，为扩散模型的迭代精炼提供了新的理论保证和实践方案。

Abstract: Iterative refinement methods based on a denoising-inversion cycle are powerful tools for enhancing the quality and control of diffusion models. However, their effectiveness is critically limited when combined with standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). We identify a fundamental limitation: CFG's extrapolative nature systematically pushes the sampling path off the data manifold, causing the approximation error to diverge and undermining the refinement process. To address this, we propose Guided Path Sampling (GPS), a new paradigm for iterative refinement. GPS replaces unstable extrapolation with a principled, manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring the sampling path remains on the data manifold. We theoretically prove that this correction transforms the error series from unbounded amplification to strictly bounded, guaranteeing stability. Furthermore, we devise an optimal scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance strength, aligning semantic injection with the model's natural coarse-to-fine generation process. Extensive experiments on modern backbones like SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT show that GPS outperforms existing methods in both perceptual quality and complex prompt adherence. For instance, GPS achieves a superior ImageReward of 0.79 and HPS v2 of 0.2995 on SDXL, while improving overall semantic alignment accuracy on GenEval to 57.45%. Our work establishes that path stability is a prerequisite for effective iterative refinement, and GPS provides a robust framework to achieve it.

Conclusion: ViLaCD-R1通过结合视觉语言模型的语义推理能力和掩码引导的解码机制，解决了遥感变化检测中的语义理解、精确定位和边界划分等关键问题，为复杂场景下的变化检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD), a complex multi-image inference task, traditionally uses pixel-based operators or encoder-decoder networks that inadequately capture high-level semantics and are vulnerable to non-semantic perturbations. Although recent multimodal and vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches enhance semantic understanding of change regions by incorporating textual descriptions, they still suffer from challenges such as inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise pixel-level boundary delineation, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 哈希网格在隐式神经场学习中被广泛用于高斯泼溅，但由于高斯泼溅在3D空间中的不规则和非均匀分布，存在大量稀疏区域，导致哈希网格中许多特征无效，造成冗余存储和传输开销。

Conclusion: 提出的哈希网格特征剪枝方法能有效减少存储和传输开销，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升压缩效率。

Abstract: Hash grids are widely used to learn an implicit neural field for Gaussian splatting, serving either as part of the entropy model or for inter-frame prediction. However, due to the irregular and non-uniform distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, numerous sparse regions exist, rendering many features in the hash grid invalid. This leads to redundant storage and transmission overhead. In this work, we propose a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on the coordinates of the input Gaussian splats, so that only the valid features are encoded. This approach reduces the storage size of the hash grid without compromising model performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance. Following the Common Test Conditions (CTC) defined by the standardization committee, our method achieves an average bitrate reduction of 8% compared to the baseline approach.

Furthermore, MedGemma exhibited notably higher sensitivity in high-stakes clinical tasks, such as cancer and pneumonia detection. Quantitative analysis via confusion matrices and classification reports provides comprehensive insights into model performance across all categories. These results emphasize that domain-specific fine-tuning is essential for minimizing hallucinations in clinical implementation, positioning MedGemma as a sophisticated tool for complex, evidence-based medical reasoning.

JavisGPT adopts a concise encoder-LLM-decoder architecture, featuring a SyncFusion module for spatio-temporal audio-video fusion and synchrony-aware learnable queries to bridge a pretrained JAV-DiT generator. This design enables temporally coherent video-audio understanding and generation from multimodal instructions. We design an effective three-stage training pipeline consisting of multimodal pretraining, audio-video fine-tuning, and large-scale instruction-tuning, to progressively build multimodal comprehension and generation from existing vision-language models. To support this, we further construct JavisInst-Omni, a high-quality instruction dataset with over 200K GPT-4o-curated audio-video-text dialogues that span diverse and multi-level comprehension and generation scenarios. Extensive experiments on JAV comprehension and generation benchmarks show that JavisGPT outperforms existing MLLMs, particularly in complex and temporally synchronized settings.

TL;DR: SoulX-LiveTalk是一个14B参数框架，通过自校正双向蒸馏和多步回顾自校正机制，在保持高视觉保真度的同时，实现了亚秒级启动延迟和32FPS实时吞吐率的音频驱动虚拟人生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模扩散模型在实时、无限时长、音频驱动的虚拟人生成中存在计算负载与严格延迟约束的冲突。现有方法通常通过强制单向注意力或降低模型容量来牺牲视觉保真度。

Method: 1. 自校正双向蒸馏策略：在视频块内保留双向注意力，保持关键时空相关性；2. 多步回顾自校正机制：使模型能够从累积错误中自主恢复；3. 全栈推理加速套件：包括混合序列并行、并行VAE和内核级优化。

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的双向注意力保留和自校正机制，成功解决了实时音频驱动虚拟人生成中的计算-延迟权衡问题，实现了高质量、稳定、实时的无限时长生成。

Abstract: Deploying massive diffusion models for real-time, infinite-duration, audio-driven avatar generation presents a significant engineering challenge, primarily due to the conflict between computational load and strict latency constraints. Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{SoulX-LiveTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail. To ensure stability during infinite generation, we incorporate a \textbf{Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism}, enabling the model to autonomously recover from accumulated errors and preventing collapse. Furthermore, we engineered a full-stack inference acceleration suite incorporating hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations. Extensive evaluations confirm that SoulX-LiveTalk is the first 14B-scale system to achieve a \textbf{sub-second start-up latency (0.87s)} while reaching a real-time throughput of \textbf{32 FPS}, setting a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis.

*Qihang Peng,Xuesong Chen,Chenye Yang,Shaoshuai Shi,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColaVLA是一个统一的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过将推理从文本转移到统一潜在空间，结合分层并行轨迹解码器，解决了VLM规划器在连续控制、延迟和实时性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的规划器面临三个关键挑战：离散文本推理与连续控制之间的不匹配、自回归思维链解码的高延迟、以及低效或非因果规划器限制实时部署。需要一种既能保持VLM泛化能力和可解释性，又能实现高效准确轨迹生成的解决方案。

Method: 提出ColaVLA框架，包含两个核心组件：1) 认知潜在推理器（Cognitive Latent Reasoner），通过自我适应选择和仅两次VLM前向传递，将场景理解压缩为紧凑的决策导向元动作嵌入；2) 分层并行规划器（Hierarchical Parallel Planner），在单次前向传递中生成多尺度、因果一致的轨迹。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中，ColaVLA在开环和闭环设置下均实现了最先进的性能，同时具有优越的效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ColaVLA成功地将VLM的泛化能力和可解释性与高效准确的轨迹生成相结合，通过统一潜在空间和分层并行解码解决了当前VLM规划器的关键挑战，为自动驾驶领域提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires generating safe and reliable trajectories from complex multimodal inputs. Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Monitoring states of road surfaces provides valuable information for the planning and controlling vehicles and active vehicle control systems. Classical road monitoring methods are expensive and unsystematic because they require time for measurements. This article proposes an real time system based on weather conditional data and road surface condition data. For this purpose, we collected data with a mobile phone camera on the roads around the campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches. The performances of the simple Alexnet, LeNet, VGG, and Resnet algorithms were compared as deep learning algorithms. For road condition classification, 5 classes were considered: asphalt, damaged asphalt, gravel road, damaged gravel road, pavement road and over 95% accuracy performance was achieved. It is also proposed to use the acceleration or the camera image to classify the road surface according to the weather and the time of day using fuzzy logic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRMNet利用密度图作为空间先验，通过密度生成分支、密集区域聚焦模块和双滤波器融合模块，有效解决高分辨率遥感图像中密集小目标检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像中存在密集的小目标，现有检测方法通常均匀分配计算资源，无法自适应聚焦于密度集中区域，导致特征学习效果受限，特别是在严重遮挡和像素足迹有限的情况下。

Method: 1. 密度生成分支(DGB)建模目标分布模式，提供量化先验指导网络关注密集区域；2. 密集区域聚焦模块(DAFM)利用密度图识别并聚焦密集区域，实现高效的局部-全局特征交互；3. 双滤波器融合模块(DFFM)使用离散余弦变换将多尺度特征解耦为高低频分量，通过密度引导的交叉注意力增强互补性并抑制背景干扰。

Result: 在AI-TOD和DTOD数据集上的大量实验表明，DRMNet超越了现有最先进方法，特别是在目标密度高、遮挡严重的复杂场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: DRMNet通过密度图引导的自适应特征学习机制，有效解决了密集小目标检测中的挑战，为高分辨率遥感图像分析提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery increasingly contains dense clusters of tiny objects, the detection of which is extremely challenging due to severe mutual occlusion and limited pixel footprints. Existing detection methods typically allocate computational resources uniformly, failing to adaptively focus on these density-concentrated regions, which hinders feature learning effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Dense Region Mining Network (DRMNet), which leverages density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning. First, we design a Density Generation Branch (DGB) to model object distribution patterns, providing quantifiable priors that guide the network toward dense regions. Second, to address the computational bottleneck of global attention, our Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) uses these density maps to identify and focus on dense areas, enabling efficient local-global feature interaction. Finally, to mitigate feature degradation during hierarchical extraction, we introduce a Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM). It disentangles multi-scale features into high- and low-frequency components using a discrete cosine transform and then performs density-guided cross-attention to enhance complementarity while suppressing background interference. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD and DTOD datasets demonstrate that DRMNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex scenarios with high object density and severe occlusion.

TL;DR: CoFi-Dec是一个无需训练的推理框架，通过粗到细的视觉条件化和生成式自反馈来减少大视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在多模态理解和生成方面取得了显著进展，但仍然倾向于产生与视觉输入不一致的幻觉内容，这限制了它们在现实应用中的可靠性。

Method: CoFi-Dec采用训练自由的解码框架，结合生成式自反馈和粗到细的视觉条件化。首先基于原始图像的粗粒度和细粒度视图生成两个中间文本响应，然后使用文生图模型将这些响应转换为合成图像，形成多级视觉假设。最后引入基于Wasserstein距离的融合机制，将这些预测分布对齐到几何一致的解码轨迹中。

Result: 在六个专注于幻觉的基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoFi-Dec显著减少了实体级和语义级的幻觉，优于现有的解码策略。

Conclusion: 该框架是模型无关的，无需额外训练，可以无缝应用于广泛的大视觉语言模型中，提高了输出的鲁棒性和忠实度。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multi-modal understanding and generation. However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec.

Conclusion: 通过可学习文本嵌入的联合优化显著提升了闭集检测性能，适用于多种架构和数据集，是一种简单且与检测器无关的框架。

Abstract: Conventional object detectors rely on cross-entropy classification, which can be vulnerable to class imbalance and label noise. We propose CLIP-Joint-Detect, a simple and detector-agnostic framework that integrates CLIP-style contrastive vision-language supervision through end-to-end joint training. A lightweight parallel head projects region or grid features into the CLIP embedding space and aligns them with learnable class-specific text embeddings via InfoNCE contrastive loss and an auxiliary cross-entropy term, while all standard detection losses are optimized simultaneously. The approach applies seamlessly to both two-stage and one-stage architectures. We validate it on Pascal VOC 2007+2012 using Faster R-CNN and on the large-scale MS COCO 2017 benchmark using modern YOLO detectors (YOLOv11), achieving consistent and substantial improvements while preserving real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that joint optimization with learnable text embeddings markedly enhances closed-set detection performance across diverse architectures and datasets.

Uniquely, we introduce a comprehensive, full-stage training paradigm -- including large-scale pretraining on over 3,000 hours of motion data, high-quality fine-tuning on 400 hours of curated data, and reinforcement learning from both human feedback and reward models -- to ensure precise alignment with the text instruction and high motion quality. This framework is supported by our meticulous data processing pipeline, which performs rigorous motion cleaning and captioning. Consequently, our model achieves the most extensive coverage, spanning over 200 motion categories across 6 major classes. We release HY-Motion 1.0 to the open-source community to foster future research and accelerate the transition of 3D human motion generation models towards commercial maturity.

Motivation: 4D毫米波雷达在自动驾驶中成本低、全天候鲁棒，但点云稀疏、语义信息有限；现有融合方法存在信息损失或计算成本过高的问题，需要更有效的多模态融合方案。

Method: 提出WRCFormer框架：1）使用解耦雷达立方体的多视图表示；2）设计小波注意力模块作为特征金字塔网络基础模块；3）引入两阶段查询式、模态无关的几何引导渐进融合机制。

Result: 在K-Radar基准测试中达到最先进性能：所有场景下提升约2.4%，雨雪场景下提升1.6%，在恶劣天气条件下表现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: WRCFormer通过直接处理原始雷达数据并有效融合相机信息，解决了4D雷达感知中的稀疏性和语义限制问题，为恶劣天气条件下的自动驾驶感知提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has been widely adopted in autonomous driving and robot perception due to its low cost and all-weather robustness. However, its inherent sparsity and limited semantic richness significantly constrain perception capability. Recently, fusing camera data with 4D radar has emerged as a promising cost effective solution, by exploiting the complementary strengths of the two modalities. Nevertheless, point-cloud-based radar often suffer from information loss introduced by multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar data incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose WRCFormer, a novel 3D object detection framework that fuses raw radar cubes with camera inputs via multi-view representations of the decoupled radar cube. Specifically, we design a Wavelet Attention Module as the basic module of wavelet-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to enhance the representation of sparse radar signals and image data. We further introduce a two-stage query-based, modality-agnostic fusion mechanism termed Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion to efficiently integrate multi-view features from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WRCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar benchmarks, surpassing the best model by approximately 2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in the sleet scenario, highlighting its robustness under adverse weather conditions.

Method: 提出AnyMS训练免费框架，采用自底向上的双级注意力解耦机制：全局解耦分离文本和视觉条件的交叉注意力以确保文本对齐；局部解耦将每个主体的注意力限制在指定区域以防止冲突。使用预训练图像适配器提取主体特征，无需主体学习或适配器调优。

Result: 实验表明AnyMS达到最先进性能，支持复杂构图并能扩展到更多主体。

Conclusion: AnyMS通过创新的注意力解耦机制，在无需训练的情况下有效解决了多主体定制中的关键挑战，实现了文本、身份和布局的平衡控制。

Abstract: Multi-subject customization aims to synthesize multiple user-specified subjects into a coherent image. To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints. However, existing methods still struggle to balance three critical objectives: text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control, while the reliance on additional training further limits their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting complex compositions and scaling to a larger number of subjects.

Conclusion: YOLO-IOD是首个支持实时YOLO框架的增量目标检测方法，有效解决了YOLO在增量学习中的三大知识冲突问题，为实时增量检测提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Current methods for incremental object detection (IOD) primarily rely on Faster R-CNN or DETR series detectors; however, these approaches do not accommodate the real-time YOLO detection frameworks. In this paper, we first identify three primary types of knowledge conflicts that contribute to catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.

Abstract: Recent pathological foundation models have substantially advanced visual representation learning and multimodal interaction. However, most models still rely on a static inference paradigm in which whole-slide images are processed once to produce predictions, without reassessment or targeted evidence acquisition under ambiguous diagnoses. This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions.

Conclusion: ReamCamo通过布局控制和多模态条件生成，显著提升了伪装图像的真实性和语义一致性，为伪装目标检测提供了更高质量的训练数据。

Abstract: Camouflaged image generation (CIG) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative for acquiring high-quality training data for camouflaged object detection (COD). However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation. ReamCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multi-modal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RxnBench是一个多层级基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型从科学PDF中理解化学反应的能力，发现现有模型在深度化学逻辑和精确结构识别方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在化学领域有革命性潜力，但其在真实文献中理解密集、图形化的反应语言的能力尚未得到充分探索。需要系统评估模型从科学PDF中提取和理解化学反应信息的能力。

Method: 开发了RxnBench基准测试，包含两个任务：1) 单图问答(SF-QA)：从305个精选反应方案中提取1,525个问题，测试细粒度视觉感知和机理推理；2) 全文档问答(FD-QA)：基于108篇文章，要求模型整合文本、方案和表格中的跨模态信息。

Result: 评估发现关键能力差距：模型擅长提取显式文本，但在深度化学逻辑和精确结构识别方面表现不佳。具有推理时推理能力的模型显著优于标准架构，但所有模型在FD-QA上的准确率均未超过50%。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了开发领域特定视觉编码器和更强推理引擎的紧迫性，以推进自主AI化学家的发展。多模态大语言模型需要专门的化学视觉理解和推理能力才能有效处理科学文献。

Abstract: The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into chemistry promises to revolutionize scientific discovery, yet their ability to comprehend the dense, graphical language of reactions within authentic literature remains underexplored. Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.

TL;DR: PoseStreamer是一个针对高速运动场景设计的鲁棒多模态6DoF姿态估计框架，通过集成自适应姿态记忆队列、物体中心2D跟踪器和射线姿态滤波器，在高速低光条件下实现优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机在高速和低光场景下存在运动模糊问题，而事件相机虽然具有高时间分辨率，但现有6DoF姿态估计方法在高速物体运动场景中表现不佳，需要专门针对高速运动场景的解决方案。

Method: 提出PoseStreamer框架，包含三个核心组件：1) 自适应姿态记忆队列，利用历史方向线索保持时间一致性；2) 物体中心2D跟踪器，提供强2D先验以提升3D中心召回；3) 射线姿态滤波器，沿相机射线进行几何细化。同时构建了MoCapCube6D多模态数据集用于快速运动下的性能评估。

Result: 大量实验表明，PoseStreamer在高速运动场景中不仅实现了优越的准确性，而且作为无模板框架对未见过的运动物体表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PoseStreamer通过多模态融合和时间一致性设计，有效解决了高速运动场景下的6DoF姿态估计挑战，为事件相机在动态环境中的应用提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Six degree of freedom (6DoF) pose estimation for novel objects is a critical task in computer vision, yet it faces significant challenges in high-speed and low-light scenarios where standard RGB cameras suffer from motion blur. While event cameras offer a promising solution due to their high temporal resolution, current 6DoF pose estimation methods typically yield suboptimal performance in high-speed object moving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose PoseStreamer, a robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework designed specifically on high-speed moving scenarios. Our approach integrates three core components: an Adaptive Pose Memory Queue that utilizes historical orientation cues for temporal consistency, an Object-centric 2D Tracker that provides strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and a Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Furthermore, we introduce MoCapCube6D, a novel multi-modal dataset constructed to benchmark performance under rapid motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseStreamer not only achieves superior accuracy in high-speed moving scenarios, but also exhibits strong generalizability as a template-free framework for unseen moving objects.

*Linglin Liao,Qichuan Geng,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSA框架通过对称最优传输对齐和复合方向引导策略，解决了医学图像分割中同时处理诊断与描述文本、捕获空间约束的难题，在公开基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导医学图像分割方法存在两个关键瓶颈：1) 难以同时处理诊断性和描述性文本，难以识别病灶并建立与图像区域的关联；2) 现有方法侧重于病灶描述而未能捕获位置约束，导致关键偏差（如"左下肺"可能错误覆盖双侧肺）。

Method: 提出空间感知对称对齐（SSA）框架：1) 对称最优传输对齐机制，加强图像区域与多个相关表达之间的关联，建立双向细粒度多模态对应；2) 复合方向引导策略，通过构建区域级引导掩码，在文本中显式引入空间约束。

Result: 在公开基准上的大量实验表明，SSA实现了最先进的性能，特别是在准确分割具有空间关系约束特征的病灶方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SSA框架有效增强了处理包含位置、描述和诊断信息的混合医学文本的能力，通过对称对齐和空间约束机制解决了现有方法的局限性，为文本引导医学图像分割提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation has shown considerable promise for medical image segmentation, with rich clinical text serving as an effective supplement for scarce data. However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text "in the left lower lung", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, particularly in accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.

Motivation: 现有基于提示的方法要么需要预训练模型能良好表示特定身份，要么需要对特定身份进行模型微调，缺乏对匿名化过程中面部属性的控制能力

Method: 采用条件扩散反演框架，无需文本提示直接操作图像；引入身份引导的条件分支以泛化到训练数据之外的主体；支持属性可控的匿名化

Result: 在身份移除、属性保留和图像质量方面达到最先进的平衡

Conclusion: 提出的反向个性化框架为面部匿名化提供了一种有效且可控的解决方案，超越了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation of realistic facial images conditioned on textual prompts and human identities, enabling creating personalized facial imagery. However, existing prompt-based methods for removing or modifying identity-specific features rely either on the subject being well-represented in the pre-trained model or require model fine-tuning for specific identities. In this work, we analyze the identity generation process and introduce a reverse personalization framework for face anonymization. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion inversion, allowing direct manipulation of images without using text prompts. To generalize beyond subjects in the model's training data, we incorporate an identity-guided conditioning branch. Unlike prior anonymization methods, which lack control over facial attributes, our framework supports attribute-controllable anonymization. We demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality.

*Ciprian Constantinescu,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG)框架，通过构建结构化场景图整合几何、语义和材料信息，显著提升物体分类准确率至73.4%，远超传统方法和大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类识别物体时能充分利用丰富的场景上下文信息（空间关系、材料属性、物体共现），而现有计算系统通常在孤立图像区域操作，忽略这些关键上下文信息，导致识别性能受限。

Method: 1. 从单目图像构建Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG)：整合度量深度估计器与统一的全景和材料分割模型，将物体编码为节点（几何、颜色、材料属性），空间关系编码为边；2. 设计专门的图基分类器，聚合目标物体、邻近物体和全局场景特征进行分类预测。

Result: 在COCO 2017数据集上，上下文感知模型达到73.4%分类准确率，远超无上下文版本（最低38.4%），也显著优于微调ResNet模型（最高53.5%）和最新多模态LLM Llama 4 Scout（最高42.3%）。

Conclusion: 显式结构化和可解释的上下文表示对于物体识别任务具有显著优势，GSCG框架通过整合几何、语义和材料信息，实现了接近人类水平的场景理解能力。

Abstract: Humans effortlessly identify objects by leveraging a rich understanding of the surrounding scene, including spatial relationships, material properties, and the co-occurrence of other objects. In contrast, most computational object recognition systems operate on isolated image regions, devoid of meaning in isolation, thus ignoring this vital contextual information. This paper argues for the critical role of context and introduces a novel framework for contextual object classification. We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable. We then propose a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from a target object, its immediate neighbors, and the global scene context to predict its class. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our context-aware model achieves a classification accuracy of 73.4%, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (as low as 38.4%). Furthermore, our GSCG-based approach significantly surpasses strong baselines, including fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%) and a state-of-the-art multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), Llama 4 Scout, which, even when given the full image alongside a detailed description of objects, maxes out at 42.3%. These results on COCO 2017 train/val splits highlight the superiority of explicitly structured and interpretable context for object recognition tasks.

TL;DR: Co2S是一个稳定的半监督遥感图像语义分割框架，通过融合视觉语言模型（CLIP）和自监督模型（DINOv3）的先验知识，解决伪标签漂移问题，提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督遥感图像语义分割虽然能减轻标注负担，但存在伪标签漂移问题——确认偏差导致训练过程中错误累积。现有方法难以有效解决这一问题。

Method: 提出异构双学生架构，分别用CLIP和DINOv3预训练的ViT模型初始化；设计显式-隐式语义协同引导机制，利用文本嵌入和可学习查询提供类级指导；开发全局-局部特征协同融合策略，融合CLIP的全局上下文和DINOv3的局部细节。

Result: 在六个流行数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种划分协议和不同场景下均取得领先性能，证明了其优越性。

Conclusion: Co2S通过协同融合视觉语言模型和自监督模型的先验知识，有效缓解了伪标签漂移问题，为半监督遥感图像语义分割提供了稳定高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-supervised remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation offers a promising solution to alleviate the burden of exhaustive annotation, yet it fundamentally struggles with pseudo-label drift, a phenomenon where confirmation bias leads to the accumulation of errors during training. In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently achieves leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: LAM3C：一种从无标签视频中学习3D表示的自监督框架，无需真实3D传感器数据，在室内语义和实例分割任务上超越现有自监督方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模3D场景扫描数据收集成本高昂且劳动密集，而网络上有大量无标签视频资源。研究能否从无真实3D传感器的无标签视频中学习3D表示

Method: 提出LAM3C框架：1) 构建RoomTours数据集，从网络收集房间漫游视频，使用现成前馈重建模型生成49,219个场景的点云；2) 提出噪声正则化损失，通过强制局部几何平滑性和确保噪声点云下的特征稳定性来稳定表示学习

Result: 不使用任何真实3D扫描数据，LAM3C在室内语义和实例分割任务上取得了比先前自监督方法更高的性能

Conclusion: 无标签视频是3D自监督学习的丰富数据源，可以从无真实3D传感器的视频中有效学习3D表示

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D self-supervised learning, collecting large-scale 3D scene scans remains expensive and labor-intensive. In this work, we investigate whether 3D representations can be learned from unlabeled videos recorded without any real 3D sensors. We present Laplacian-Aware Multi-level 3D Clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp (LAM3C), a self-supervised framework that learns from video-generated point clouds from unlabeled videos. We first introduce RoomTours, a video-generated point cloud dataset constructed by collecting room-walkthrough videos from the web (e.g., real-estate tours) and generating 49,219 scenes using an off-the-shelf feed-forward reconstruction model. We also propose a noise-regularized loss that stabilizes representation learning by enforcing local geometric smoothness and ensuring feature stability under noisy point clouds. Remarkably, without using any real 3D scans, LAM3C achieves higher performance than the previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation. These results suggest that unlabeled videos represent an abundant source of data for 3D self-supervised learning.

TL;DR: Video-BrowseComp是一个新的视频研究基准测试，专门评估智能体在开放网络中进行主动视频推理的能力，要求模型必须依赖时间视觉证据而非仅文本搜索来回答问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基准测试主要关注被动感知，缺乏对主动视频研究的评估。现有方法无法评估智能体在开放网络中进行视频研究的能力，包括主动探索视频时间线、交叉引用分散证据以及验证网络声明的能力。

Method: 提出了Video-BrowseComp基准测试，包含210个专门设计的问题，强制要求依赖时间视觉证据。问题设计确保答案不能仅通过文本搜索获得，而必须导航视频时间线来验证外部声明。

Result: 评估显示最先进模型表现不佳，即使是GPT-5.1（带搜索）也仅达到15.24%准确率。模型主要依赖文本代理，在元数据丰富的领域表现良好，但在元数据稀疏的动态环境中表现崩溃。

Conclusion: Video-BrowseComp填补了视频研究领域的空白，推动了从被动感知向主动视频推理的转变，揭示了当前模型在视觉基础方面的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: The evolution of autonomous agents is redefining information seeking, transitioning from passive retrieval to proactive, open-ended web research. However, while textual and static multimodal agents have seen rapid progress, a significant modality gap remains in processing the web's most dynamic modality: video. Existing video benchmarks predominantly focus on passive perception, feeding curated clips to models without requiring external retrieval. They fail to evaluate agentic video research, which necessitates actively interrogating video timelines, cross-referencing dispersed evidence, and verifying claims against the open web. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Video-BrowseComp}, a challenging benchmark comprising 210 questions tailored for open-web agentic video reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks, Video-BrowseComp enforces a mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, ensuring that answers cannot be derived solely through text search but require navigating video timelines to verify external claims. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a critical bottleneck: even advanced search-augmented models like GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieve only 15.24\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals that these models largely rely on textual proxies, excelling in metadata-rich domains (e.g., TV shows with plot summaries) but collapsing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments (e.g., sports, gameplay) where visual grounding is essential. As the first open-web video research benchmark, Video-BrowseComp advances the field beyond passive perception toward proactive video reasoning.

TL;DR: 深度学习变形图像配准模型具有固有的跨域鲁棒性，源于其依赖局部特征而非全局外观进行变形估计。UniReg框架通过固定预训练特征提取器和UNet变形网络实现单数据集训练下的跨域多模态配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为基于学习的配准模型对域偏移敏感，通常需要大量多样化训练数据来提升鲁棒性，但缺乏对内在机制的解释。本文旨在揭示深度学习变形配准模型的内在鲁棒性机制。

Method: 提出UniReg通用配准框架，将特征提取与变形估计解耦：使用固定的预训练特征提取器（如ResNet）提取局部特征，然后通过UNet变形网络估计变形场。该方法仅需在单个数据集上训练。

Result: UniReg在单数据集训练下展现出与优化方法相当的跨域和多模态配准鲁棒性。分析发现传统CNN模型在模态偏移下的失败源于早期卷积层的数据集诱导偏差。

Conclusion: 局部特征一致性是基于学习的变形配准模型鲁棒性的关键驱动因素。这一发现为设计能够保持域不变局部特征的骨干网络提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced deformable image registration, surpassing traditional optimization-based methods in both accuracy and efficiency. However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers. These findings identify local feature consistency as the key driver of robustness in learning-based deformable registration and motivate backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection, aiming to explore unlabeled data for boosting 3D object detectors, has emerged as an active research area in recent years. Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: REVEALER提供了一个统一、可解释的文本-图像对齐评估框架，通过强化学习引导的视觉推理实现了细粒度元素级评估，在性能和效率上都表现出色。

Abstract: Evaluating the alignment between textual prompts and generated images is critical for ensuring the reliability and usability of text-to-image (T2I) models. However, most existing evaluation methods rely on coarse-grained metrics or static QA pipelines, which lack fine-grained interpretability and struggle to reflect human preferences. To address this, we propose REVEALER, a unified framework for element-level alignment evaluation based on reinforcement-guided visual reasoning. Adopting a structured "grounding-reasoning-conclusion" paradigm, our method enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly localize semantic elements and derive interpretable alignment judgments. We optimize the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) using a composite reward function that incorporates structural format, grounding accuracy, and alignment fidelity. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks-EvalMuse-40K, RichHF, MHaluBench, and GenAI-Bench-demonstrate that REVEALER achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our approach consistently outperforms both strong proprietary models and supervised baselines while demonstrating superior inference efficiency compared to existing iterative visual reasoning methods.

Conclusion: 高斯和体素表示捕获互补几何信息，通过协同学习可以显著提升3D检测性能，为无监督图像基3D检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection aims to identify and localize objects in 3D space using only RGB images, eliminating the need for expensive depth sensors required by point cloud-based methods. Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).

Abstract: Driving World Models (DWMs) have been developing rapidly with the advances of generative models. However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM. Furthermore, we design a dual-condition multi-modal generation model, where the information captured by our vision-language model is leveraged as a high-level language condition in combination with a low-level image condition, jointly guiding the multi-modal generation process. We conduct comprehensive studies on the nuScenes, and NuInteract datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We will release the code publicly on GitHub https://github.com/dtc111111/GaussianDWM.

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应选择扩散模型时间步特征的方法，通过任务感知时间步选择和特征整合模块，在少样本密集预测任务中提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型应用中，时间步特征的选择主要依赖经验直觉，往往导致次优性能且偏向特定任务。需要一种自适应方法来选择最适合少样本密集预测任务的时间步特征。

Method: 提出两个模块：任务感知时间步选择（TTS）基于时间步损失和相似度得分选择理想时间步；时间步特征整合（TFC）整合选定时间步特征以提升密集预测性能。配合参数高效微调适配器，在少样本设置下工作。

Result: 在大型挑战性Taskonomy数据集上进行密集预测验证，特别是在通用和少样本学习场景下，该方法在少样本密集预测性能上表现出优越性。

Conclusion: 通过自适应选择扩散模型时间步特征并进行整合，能够有效提升少样本密集预测任务的性能，解决了当前方法依赖经验直觉导致的次优问题。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have brought tremendous advances in generative tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance thus far. Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries. We empirically validate our learnable timestep consolidation method on the large-scale challenging Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction, particularly for practical universal and few-shot learning scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者提出了AVOID数据集，这是一个在模拟环境中收集的用于实时障碍物检测的对抗性视觉条件数据集，包含各种天气和时间条件下的意外道路障碍物，并配有语义分割图、深度图、LiDAR数据和路径点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有道路驾驶数据集要么只包含正常场景，要么只包含对抗场景，且往往不包含与其他类别在同一视觉域中捕获的道路障碍物。需要可靠地实时检测各种对抗条件下（如天气和光照变化）的意外小道路危险。

Method: 引入AVOID数据集，在模拟环境中收集大量意外道路障碍物，涵盖各种天气和时间条件。每个图像都配有对应的语义分割图、深度图、原始和语义LiDAR数据以及路径点。在实时网络上进行障碍物检测基准测试，并提出并进行了多任务网络（语义分割、深度和路径点预测）的消融研究。

Conclusion: AVOID数据集填补了现有道路驾驶数据集的空白，为在对抗性视觉条件下进行实时障碍物检测和相关视觉感知任务的研究提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Understanding road scenes for visual perception remains crucial for intelligent self-driving cars. In particular, it is desirable to detect unexpected small road hazards reliably in real-time, especially under varying adverse conditions (e.g., weather and daylight). However, existing road driving datasets provide large-scale images acquired in either normal or adverse scenarios only, and often do not contain the road obstacles captured in the same visual domain as for the other classes. To address this, we introduce a new dataset called AVOID, the Adverse Visual Conditions Dataset, for real-time obstacle detection collected in a simulated environment. AVOID consists of a large set of unexpected road obstacles located along each path captured under various weather and time conditions. Each image is coupled with the corresponding semantic and depth maps, raw and semantic LiDAR data, and waypoints, thereby supporting most visual perception tasks. We benchmark the results on high-performing real-time networks for the obstacle detection task, and also propose and conduct ablation studies using a comprehensive multi-task network for semantic segmentation, depth and waypoint prediction tasks.

TL;DR: MM-UAVBench：首个面向低空无人机场景的多模态大语言模型综合评测基准，涵盖感知、认知、规划三大能力维度，包含19个子任务和5700+人工标注问题，揭示现有模型在复杂低空场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在通用领域表现出色，但在以无人机为主的低空应用场景中潜力尚未充分探索。现有MLLM基准很少涵盖低空场景的独特挑战，而无人机相关评估主要关注特定任务（如定位、导航），缺乏对MLLM通用智能的统一评估。

Method: 提出MM-UAVBench基准，系统评估MLLM在低空无人机场景中的三大核心能力维度：感知、认知和规划。基准包含19个子任务，超过5700个人工标注问题，所有数据均来自公开数据集的真实无人机采集数据。

Result: 对16个开源和专有MLLM的广泛实验表明，当前模型难以适应低空场景的复杂视觉和认知需求。分析进一步揭示了阻碍MLLM在无人机场景中有效部署的关键瓶颈，如空间偏见和多视角理解问题。

Conclusion: MM-UAVBench填补了低空无人机场景中MLLM评估的空白，希望该基准能促进未来面向真实世界无人机智能的稳健可靠MLLM研究。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable general intelligence across diverse domains, their potential in low-altitude applications dominated by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) remains largely underexplored. Existing MLLM benchmarks rarely cover the unique challenges of low-altitude scenarios, while UAV-related evaluations mainly focus on specific tasks such as localization or navigation, without a unified evaluation of MLLMs'general intelligence. To bridge this gap, we present MM-UAVBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across three core capability dimensions-perception, cognition, and planning-in low-altitude UAV scenarios. MM-UAVBench comprises 19 sub-tasks with over 5.7K manually annotated questions, all derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets. Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveal that current models struggle to adapt to the complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios. Our analyses further uncover critical bottlenecks such as spatial bias and multi-view understanding that hinder the effective deployment of MLLMs in UAV scenarios. We hope MM-UAVBench will foster future research on robust and reliable MLLMs for real-world UAV intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMAGE是一个统一的导演模型，将剧本创作和关键镜头设计整合到单一框架中，使非专业人士能够利用现有音视频生成模型制作长上下文、多镜头的电影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI视频创作系统通常将剧本起草和关键镜头设计视为两个独立任务：前者依赖大语言模型，后者依赖图像生成模型。作者认为这两个任务应该统一在一个框架中，因为逻辑推理和想象力思维都是电影导演的基本素质。

Method: 采用Mixture-of-Transformers架构统一文本和图像生成。引入"先交织后解耦"的训练范式：1) 交织概念学习：使用交织的文本-图像数据培养模型对剧本的深入理解和想象力解释；2) 解耦专家学习：将剧本写作与关键帧生成解耦，实现更大的故事叙述灵活性和创造性。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniMAGE在开源模型中实现了最先进的性能，能够生成逻辑连贯的视频剧本和视觉一致的关键帧图像。

Conclusion: UniMAGE成功地将剧本创作和关键镜头设计统一到单一框架中，为非专业人士提供了制作高质量多镜头电影的能力，同时保持了叙事逻辑和视觉一致性。

Abstract: Existing AI-driven video creation systems typically treat script drafting and key-shot design as two disjoint tasks: the former relies on large language models, while the latter depends on image generation models. We argue that these two tasks should be unified within a single framework, as logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both fundamental qualities of a film director. In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm. Specifically, we first perform Interleaved Concept Learning, which utilizes interleaved text-image data to foster the model's deeper understanding and imaginative interpretation of scripts. We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的逆问题求解方法需要数百或数千步才能达到高质量重建，存在误差累积问题。需要开发更高效的采样方法以减少计算成本。

Method: 提出SURE引导的后验采样方法，使用Stein无偏风险估计梯度更新和PCA噪声估计来纠正采样轨迹偏差，减少噪声引起的误差积累。

Result: 在少于100次神经网络评估下保持高质量重建，在多种逆问题上优于现有方法，特别是在低评估次数时表现更优。

Conclusion: SGPS通过纠正采样偏差有效减少误差积累，实现了高效高质量的逆问题求解，为扩散模型在逆问题中的应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful learned priors for solving inverse problems. However, current iterative solving approaches which alternate between diffusion sampling and data consistency steps typically require hundreds or thousands of steps to achieve high quality reconstruction due to accumulated errors. We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs). Our extensive evaluation across diverse inverse problems demonstrates that SGPS consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts.

TL;DR: 提出一种用于遥感扩散基础模型的无训练两阶段数据剪枝方法，通过熵值筛选和场景感知聚类，在高剪枝率下选择高质量数据子集，显著提升模型收敛和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感扩散基础模型依赖大量全局代表性数据，但这些数据通常包含冗余、噪声和类别不平衡问题，降低了训练效率并阻碍收敛。现有方法通常简单聚合多个分类数据集或应用简单的去重，忽视了生成建模的分布需求和遥感图像的异质性。

Method: 提出无训练的两阶段数据剪枝方法：1）基于熵的准则高效去除低信息样本；2）利用遥感场景分类数据集作为参考基准，进行场景感知聚类和分层采样，在平衡聚类均匀性和样本代表性的同时，在高剪枝率下实现细粒度选择。

Result: 实验表明，即使在剪枝85%训练数据后，该方法仍能显著改善收敛和生成质量。使用该方法训练的扩散基础模型在下游任务（如超分辨率和语义图像合成）中持续达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 这种数据剪枝范式为开发遥感生成基础模型提供了实用指导，能够在保持整体多样性和代表性的同时，通过高效数据选择提升模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based remote sensing (RS) generative foundation models are cruial for downstream tasks. However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality. Furthermore, diffusion foundation models trained with our method consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks, including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis. This data pruning paradigm offers practical guidance for developing RS generative foundation models.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion of remote sensing images serves as a core technology for overcoming the limitations of single-source data and improving the accuracy of surface information extraction, which exhibits significant application value in fields such as environmental monitoring and urban planning. To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval. This technical framework provides a novel approach for constructing efficient and robust multimodal remote sensing systems, laying a theoretical foundation and offering technical guidance for the engineering application of intelligent remote sensing interpretation.

Conclusion: ASemconsist通过创新的语义控制策略和自适应特征共享，成功解决了角色身份一致性生成中的关键挑战，并通过CQS提供了更全面的评估方法。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved visual quality and text alignment. However, generating a sequence of images while preserving consistent character identity across diverse scene descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between maintaining identity consistency and ensuring per-image prompt alignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs. Project page: https://minjung-s.github.io/asemconsist

Abstract: Image representation is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression. We also introduce a warm-up scheme to stabilize training and improve convergence. Experiments on synthetic color charts and the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods. The improvement is particularly evident in scenarios with very few Gaussians, while our method still maintains fast rendering and low memory usage.

Conclusion: CEM是模型无关的通用插件，可无缝集成到现有错误修正框架和量化模型中，无需额外计算开销，显著提升扩散模型加速的保真度

Abstract: Although Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a predominant architecture for image and video generation, its iterative denoising process results in slow inference, which hinders broader applicability and development. Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on nine generation models and quantized methods across three tasks demonstrate that CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models, and outperforms the original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$α$, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: YOLO-Master提出了一种基于实例条件自适应计算的实时目标检测框架，通过ES-MoE块动态分配计算资源，在保持实时性的同时提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实时目标检测方法采用静态密集计算，对所有输入进行统一处理，导致计算资源分配不当：简单场景计算过度，复杂场景计算不足，既造成计算冗余又影响检测性能。

Method: 提出YOLO-Master框架，引入实例条件自适应计算，核心是高效稀疏混合专家（ES-MoE）块。使用轻量级动态路由网络在训练中引导专家专业化，通过多样性增强目标鼓励专家互补，推理时仅激活最相关专家。

Result: 在五个大规模基准测试中表现优异。MS COCO上达到42.4% AP和1.62ms延迟，比YOLOv13-N提升+0.8% mAP且推理速度快17.8%。在密集场景中提升最明显，同时保持典型输入的高效性和实时推理速度。

Conclusion: YOLO-Master通过实例条件自适应计算解决了传统YOLO类模型静态计算的问题，实现了计算资源动态分配，在保持实时性的同时显著提升了检测性能，特别是在复杂场景中。

Abstract: Existing Real-Time Object Detection (RTOD) methods commonly adopt YOLO-like architectures for their favorable trade-off between accuracy and speed. However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference. Notably, the gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes, while the model preserves efficiency on typical inputs and maintains real-time inference speed. Code will be available.

In this work, we present two multimodal frameworks designed to tackle both problems on the iMiGUE dataset. For micro-gesture classification, we explore the complementary strengths of RGB and 3D pose-based representations to capture nuanced spatio-temporal patterns. To comprehensively represent gestures, video, and skeletal embeddings are extracted using MViTv2-S and 2s-AGCN, respectively. Then, they are integrated through a Cross-Modal Token Fusion module to combine spatial and pose information. For emotion recognition, our framework extends to behavior-based emotion prediction, a binary classification task identifying emotional states based on visual cues. We leverage facial and contextual embeddings extracted using SwinFace and MViTv2-S models and fuse them through an InterFusion module designed to capture emotional expressions and body gestures. Experiments conducted on the iMiGUE dataset, within the scope of the MiGA 2025 Challenge, demonstrate the robust performance and accuracy of our method in the behavior-based emotion prediction task, where our approach secured 2nd place.

Conclusion: CME-CAD范式能够生成准确、约束兼容且完全可编辑的CAD模型，解决了工业设计中自动化CAD生成的精度和可编辑性问题。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is essential in industrial design, but the complexity of traditional CAD modeling and workflows presents significant challenges for automating the generation of high-precision, editable CAD models. Existing methods that reconstruct 3D models from sketches often produce non-editable and approximate models that fall short of meeting the stringent requirements for precision and editability in industrial design. Moreover, the reliance on text or image-based inputs often requires significant manual annotation, limiting their scalability and applicability in industrial settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (CME-CAD) paradigm, a novel training paradigm for CAD code generation. Our approach integrates the complementary strengths of these models, facilitating collaborative learning and improving the model's ability to generate accurate, constraint-compatible, and fully editable CAD models. We introduce a two-stage training process: Multi-Expert Fine-Tuning (MEFT), and Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (MERL). Additionally, we present CADExpert, an open-source benchmark consisting of 17,299 instances, including orthographic projections with precise dimension annotations, expert-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, executable CADQuery code, and rendered 3D models.

*Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文从拓扑角度研究视觉表示学习，提出视觉理解需要语义语言，视觉空间具有纤维丛结构，语义不变性需要非同胚的判别性目标，语义抽象需要支持拓扑变化的表示机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从结构和拓扑角度理解视觉表示学习，提出核心假设：视觉理解需要语义语言，许多感知观察对应少量离散语义状态。结合表示学习中广泛接受的迁移性和抽象性前提，探索视觉观察空间的结构组织。

Method: 采用拓扑和几何分析方法，将视觉观察空间建模为纤维丛结构，其中干扰变化填充纤维，语义对应商基空间。从该结构推导理论结果：1) 语义商空间不是子流形，不能通过光滑变形获得；2) 近似商空间对模型架构有结构要求。

Result: 理论推导表明：1) 语义不变性需要非同胚的判别性目标（如监督标签、跨实例识别或多模态对齐）；2) 语义抽象需要支持拓扑变化的表示机制，即"扩展-捕捉"过程：先几何扩展分离结构，再坍缩形成离散语义区域。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了拓扑视角，与大规模判别性和多模态模型的经验规律以及统计学习理论的经典原理相一致。这些结果是解释性的而非规范性的，为理解视觉表示学习提供了理论框架。

Abstract: We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.

Conclusion: 通过扩展目标对象的指定方式，CountGD++显著提高了多模态开放世界计数的提示灵活性，为更准确、高效的视觉计数任务提供了新方法。

Abstract: The flexibility and accuracy of methods for automatically counting objects in images and videos are limited by the way the object can be specified. While existing methods allow users to describe the target object with text and visual examples, the visual examples must be manually annotated inside the image, and there is no way to specify what not to count. To address these gaps, we introduce novel capabilities that expand how the target object can be specified. Specifically, we extend the prompt to enable what not to count to be described with text and/or visual examples, introduce the concept of `pseudo-exemplars' that automate the annotation of visual examples at inference, and extend counting models to accept visual examples from both natural and synthetic external images. We also use our new counting model, CountGD++, as a vision expert agent for an LLM. Together, these contributions expand the prompt flexibility of multi-modal open-world counting and lead to significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: 通过构建大规模真实空间推理数据集和基准，以及集成3D几何编码的混合框架，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在复杂真实环境中的空间推理能力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for enhanced 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning. However, existing approaches often rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or off-the-shelf reconstruction pipelines, which constrain scalability and real-world applicability. A recent line of work explores learning spatial reasoning directly from multi-view images, enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand 3D scenes without explicit 3D reconstructions. Nevertheless, key challenges that frequently arise in real-world environments, such as partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions that require spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues, remain under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline that constructs realistic spatial reasoning QAs, resulting in SpatialMosaic, a comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset featuring 2M QA pairs. We further introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning under realistic and challenging scenarios, consisting of 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks. In addition, we present SpatialMosaicVLM, a hybrid framework that integrates 3D reconstruction models as geometry encoders within VLMs for robust spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and VQA tasks effectively enhance spatial reasoning under challenging multi-view conditions, validating the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline in constructing realistic and diverse QA pairs. Code and dataset will be available soon.

Conclusion: MGCA-Net通过创新的几何注意力机制和跨阶段共识模块，有效解决了现有方法在几何建模和跨阶段优化方面的不足，提升了对应关系学习的性能。

Abstract: Two-view correspondence learning is a key task in computer vision, which aims to establish reliable matching relationships for applications such as camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods have limitations in local geometric modeling and cross-stage information optimization, which make it difficult to accurately capture the geometric constraints of matched pairs and thus reduce the robustness of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Graph Contextual Attention Network (MGCA-Net), which consists of a Contextual Geometric Attention (CGA) module and a Cross-Stage Multi-Graph Consensus (CSMGC) module. Specifically, CGA dynamically integrates spatial position and feature information via an adaptive attention mechanism and enhances the capability to capture both local and global geometric relationships. Meanwhile, CSMGC establishes geometric consensus via a cross-stage sparse graph network, ensuring the consistency of geometric information across different stages. Experimental results on two representative YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets show that MGCA-Net significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in the outlier rejection and camera pose estimation tasks.

TL;DR: NeXT-IMDL是一个大规模诊断基准，旨在系统性地探测当前图像篡改检测模型的泛化边界，揭示了现有方法在处理多样化AI生成内容时的系统性失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户友好的图像编辑模型普及和滥用风险增加，需要通用且最新的图像篡改检测与定位方法。当前研究使用跨数据集评估，但这种简化方法掩盖了现有方法处理多样化AI生成内容时的脆弱性，导致对进展的误导性印象。

Method: 提出NeXT-IMDL基准，将AIGC篡改沿四个基本轴分类：编辑模型、篡改类型、内容语义和伪造粒度。基于此实现五个严格的跨维度评估协议，对11个代表性模型进行广泛实验。

Result: 实验揭示关键发现：虽然这些模型在原始设置下表现良好，但在模拟真实世界各种泛化场景的设计协议下，它们表现出系统性失败和显著性能下降。

Conclusion: 通过提供这个诊断工具包和新发现，旨在推动开发真正鲁棒的下一代IMDL模型，挑战当前评估方法造成的进步假象。

Abstract: The accessibility surge and abuse risks of user-friendly image editing models have created an urgent need for generalizable, up-to-date methods for Image Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL). Current IMDL research typically uses cross-dataset evaluation, where models trained on one benchmark are tested on others. However, this simplified evaluation approach conceals the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, leading to misleading impressions of progress. This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically. Specifically, NeXT-IMDL categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios. By providing this diagnostic toolkit and the new findings, we aim to advance the development towards building truly robust, next-generation IMDL models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOFTooth：一种语义增强、顺序感知的2D-3D融合框架，利用冻结的2D语义（SAM）提升3D牙齿实例分割性能，无需2D掩码监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D牙齿实例分割面临拥挤牙弓、模糊的牙齿-牙龈边界、缺失牙齿和临床重要的第三磨牙等挑战。现有3D方法存在边界泄漏、中心漂移和身份不一致问题，而2D基础模型（如SAM）虽提供强边界语义，但直接应用于3D临床工作流不切实际。

Method: 提出SOFTooth框架：1）点级残差门控模块将咬合视图SAM嵌入注入3D点特征以细化边界；2）中心引导掩码细化正则化实例掩码与几何质心一致性；3）顺序感知匈牙利匹配策略整合解剖牙齿顺序和中心距离，确保连贯标记。

Result: 在3DTeethSeg'22数据集上达到最先进的整体准确率和平均IoU，在涉及第三磨牙的案例上表现尤其突出，证明无需2D微调即可将丰富2D语义有效迁移到3D牙齿分割。

Conclusion: SOFTooth通过融合2D语义和3D几何信息，解决了3D牙齿分割的关键挑战，为临床工作流提供了实用解决方案，展示了2D基础模型在3D医学图像分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) tooth instance segmentation remains challenging due to crowded arches, ambiguous tooth-gingiva boundaries, missing teeth, and rare yet clinically important third molars. Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions. On 3DTeethSeg'22, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating that rich 2D semantics can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 论文提出ArtQuant框架和RAD数据集，通过多维度结构化数据和LLM解码器解决艺术图像美学评估中的数据稀缺和模型碎片化问题，在减少训练成本的同时达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美学质量评估对AIGC的人对齐定量评估系统至关重要，但其复杂性（视觉感知、认知、情感）带来根本挑战。现有方法存在数据稀缺不平衡（过度关注视觉感知）和模型碎片化（多分支编码器隔离美学属性，对比学习方法难以处理长文本描述）两大问题。

Method: 1) 提出RAD数据集：大规模（70k）、多维度结构化数据集，通过迭代流水线生成，无需昂贵人工标注且易于扩展；2) 提出ArtQuant框架：通过联合描述生成耦合孤立美学维度，利用LLM解码器更好建模长文本语义，理论分析证实数据语义充分性和生成范式共同最小化预测熵。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最先进性能，仅需传统训练33%的epoch，缩小了艺术图像与美学判断之间的认知差距。

Conclusion: 通过RAD数据集和ArtQuant框架解决了美学评估中的数据稀缺和模型碎片化问题，为艺术图像美学评估提供了有效的解决方案，将开源代码和数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: The aesthetic quality assessment task is crucial for developing a human-aligned quantitative evaluation system for AIGC. However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders. Besides, theoretical analysis confirms this symbiosis: RAD's semantic adequacy (data) and generation paradigm (model) collectively minimize prediction entropy, providing mathematical grounding for the framework. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs, narrowing the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment. We will release both code and dataset to support future research.

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶中的世界模型存在局限性，虽然采用统一架构，但仍将世界预测和运动规划作为解耦过程处理。需要弥合这一差距，实现真正的统一。

Method: 提出DriveLaW范式，包含两个核心组件：DriveLaW-Video（生成高保真预测的强世界模型）和DriveLaW-Act（从视频潜在表示生成一致可靠轨迹的扩散规划器），采用三阶段渐进训练策略优化。

Result: 在两项任务上均取得新的SOTA结果：视频预测方面超越最佳工作33.3%（FID）和1.8%（FVD）；在NAVSIM规划基准上创下新纪录。

Conclusion: DriveLaW通过统一视频生成与运动规划，实现了高保真未来生成与可靠轨迹规划的内在一致性，为自动驾驶世界模型提供了新范式。

Abstract: World models have become crucial for autonomous driving, as they learn how scenarios evolve over time to address the long-tail challenges of the real world. However, current approaches relegate world models to limited roles: they operate within ostensibly unified architectures that still keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes. To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本到图像合成中难以完全对齐用户意图并保持一致的审美质量。现有的偏好训练方法（如Diffusion DPO）依赖昂贵且可能有噪声的人工标注数据集，需要更好的解决方案。

Method: 提出DDSPO方法，直接从获胜和失败策略中推导每个时间步的监督信号（当这些策略可用时）。避免依赖标注数据，使用预训练参考模型自动生成偏好信号：对比原始提示与语义降级变体条件下的输出。提供密集的、过渡级的信号，而非仅基于最终样本。

Result: DDSPO在文本-图像对齐和视觉质量方面均有提升，优于或匹配现有的基于偏好的方法，同时需要显著更少的监督。实验结果表明该方法有效且实用。

Conclusion: DDSPO提供了一种有效的分数空间偏好监督方法，无需显式奖励建模或手动标注，通过密集的时间步监督改善了扩散模型的性能，为扩散模型偏好优化提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks such as text-to-image synthesis, yet they often struggle to fully align outputs with nuanced user intent and maintain consistent aesthetic quality. Existing preference-based training methods like Diffusion Direct Preference Optimization help address these issues but rely on costly and potentially noisy human-labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision. Our implementation is available at: https://dohyun-as.github.io/DDSPO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然SAM等基础分割模型在零样本任务中表现良好，但在领域偏移或知识有限的情况下仍然脆弱。本研究旨在探索不确定性量化能否以领域无关的方式缓解这些挑战并增强模型的泛化能力。

Method: 1) 创建UncertSAM基准，包含8个数据集，专门设计用于在阴影、透明度和伪装等挑战性分割条件下测试SAM；2) 评估一系列轻量级、后验的不确定性估计方法；3) 评估初步的不确定性引导的预测细化步骤。

Result: 在评估的方法中，最后一层拉普拉斯近似产生的不确定性估计与分割误差有良好的相关性，表明存在有意义的信号。虽然细化步骤的益处尚属初步，但研究结果强调了将不确定性纳入分割模型以支持鲁棒、领域无关性能的潜力。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化有潜力增强分割模型在挑战性条件下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。研究创建的UncertSAM基准和代码已公开，为后续研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Foundation models for segmentation such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) family exhibit strong zero-shot performance, but remain vulnerable in shifted or limited-knowledge domains. This work investigates whether uncertainty quantification can mitigate such challenges and enhance model generalisability in a domain-agnostic manner. To this end, we (1) curate UncertSAM, a benchmark comprising eight datasets designed to stress-test SAM under challenging segmentation conditions including shadows, transparency, and camouflage; (2) evaluate a suite of lightweight, post-hoc uncertainty estimation methods; and (3) assess a preliminary uncertainty-guided prediction refinement step. Among evaluated approaches, a last-layer Laplace approximation yields uncertainty estimates that correlate well with segmentation errors, indicating a meaningful signal. While refinement benefits are preliminary, our findings underscore the potential of incorporating uncertainty into segmentation models to support robust, domain-agnostic performance. Our benchmark and code are made publicly available.

TL;DR: RealX3D是一个真实捕获的多视角视觉恢复和3D重建基准数据集，包含四种物理退化类型（光照、散射、遮挡、模糊），在不同严重程度下捕获，提供像素对齐的低质量/高质量视图、高分辨率图像、RAW数据和激光扫描数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视角视觉恢复和3D重建方法在理想条件下表现良好，但在真实世界的物理退化（如光照变化、散射、遮挡、模糊等）下表现脆弱。缺乏一个包含多种物理退化的真实捕获基准数据集来评估这些方法的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用统一的采集协议捕获像素对齐的低质量/高质量视图，将退化分为四类：光照、散射、遮挡、模糊，每个类别包含多个严重程度。每个场景包含高分辨率捕获、RAW图像和密集激光扫描，从中导出世界尺度网格和度量深度。

Result: 对基于优化的和前馈方法的广泛基准测试显示，在物理退化条件下重建质量显著下降，突显了当前多视角流程在真实世界挑战性环境中的脆弱性。

Conclusion: RealX3D基准数据集揭示了当前多视角视觉恢复和3D重建方法在真实世界物理退化下的局限性，为开发更鲁棒的算法提供了重要的评估工具和挑战。

Abstract: We introduce RealX3D, a real-capture benchmark for multi-view visual restoration and 3D reconstruction under diverse physical degradations. RealX3D groups corruptions into four families, including illumination, scattering, occlusion, and blurring, and captures each at multiple severity levels using a unified acquisition protocol that yields pixel-aligned LQ/GT views. Each scene includes high-resolution capture, RAW images, and dense laser scans, from which we derive world-scale meshes and metric depth. Benchmarking a broad range of optimization-based and feed-forward methods shows substantial degradation in reconstruction quality under physical corruptions, underscoring the fragility of current multi-view pipelines in real-world challenging environments.

Abstract: Accurate and continuous monitoring of river water levels is essential for flood forecasting, water resource management, and ecological protection. Traditional hydrological observation methods are often limited by manual measurement errors and environmental constraints. This study presents a hybrid framework integrating vision based waterline detection, YOLOv8 pose scale extraction, and large multimodal language models (GPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for automated river gauge plate reading. The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation. Overall, the proposed approach offers a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution for automated hydrological monitoring, demonstrating potential for real time river gauge digitization and improved water resource management.

Abstract: Image-to-Image (I2I) translation involves converting an image from one domain to another. Deterministic I2I translation, such as in image super-resolution, extends this concept by guaranteeing that each input generates a consistent and predictable output, closely matching the ground truth (GT) with high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual approximators (Dual-approx Bridge), a novel generative model that exploits the Brownian bridge dynamics and two neural network-based approximators (one for forward and one for reverse process) to produce faithful output with negligible variance and high image quality in I2I translations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including image generation and super-resolution demonstrate the consistent and superior performance of Dual-approx Bridge in terms of image quality and faithfulness to GT when compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

Abstract: Robust and discriminative feature learning is critical for high-quality point cloud registration. However, existing deep learning-based methods typically rely on Euclidean neighborhood-based strategies for feature extraction, which struggle to effectively capture the implicit semantics and structural consistency in point clouds. To address these issues, we propose a multi-domain context integration network (MCI-Net) that improves feature representation and registration performance by aggregating contextual cues from diverse domains. Specifically, we propose a graph neighborhood aggregation module, which constructs a global graph to capture the overall structural relationships within point clouds. We then propose a progressive context interaction module to enhance feature discriminability by performing intra-domain feature decoupling and inter-domain context interaction. Finally, we design a dynamic inlier selection method that optimizes inlier weights using residual information from multiple iterations of pose estimation, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of registration. Extensive experiments on indoor RGB-D and outdoor LiDAR datasets show that the proposed MCI-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving the highest registration recall of 96.4\% on 3DMatch.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbones in two-view correspondence learning, demonstrating significant superiority over methods based on multilayer perceptrons. However, CNN backbones that are not tailored to specific tasks may fail to effectively aggregate global context and oversmooth dense motion fields in scenes with large disparity. To address these problems, we propose a novel network named SC-Net, which effectively integrates bilateral context from both spatial and channel perspectives. Specifically, we design an adaptive focused regularization module (AFR) to enhance the model's position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion samples, thereby facilitating the generation of a more accurate motion field. We then propose a bilateral field adjustment module (BFA) to refine the motion field by simultaneously modeling long-range relationships and facilitating interaction across spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, we recover the motion vectors from the refined field using a position-aware recovery module (PAR) that ensures consistency and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

TL;DR: TV-RAG是一个无需训练的架构，通过时间对齐和熵引导语义来提升长视频推理能力，包含时间衰减检索和熵加权关键帧采样两个核心机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视频语言模型在处理长视频时存在两个主要问题：时间窗口狭窄，无法捕捉长时间跨度的语义变化；主流文本检索管道主要依赖表面词汇重叠，忽略了视觉、音频和字幕通道之间的时间相互依赖性。

Method: 提出TV-RAG框架，包含两个核心机制：1) 时间衰减检索模块，将显式时间偏移注入相似度计算，根据真实多媒体上下文对文本查询进行排序；2) 熵加权关键帧采样器，选择均匀间隔、信息密集的帧，减少冗余同时保持代表性。

Conclusion: TV-RAG提供了一个轻量级、经济高效的升级路径，无需重新训练或微调即可集成到任何大型视频语言模型中，通过结合时间和语义信号实现了双级推理能力。

Abstract: Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly emerged as the focus of multimedia AI research. Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

Abstract: Context modeling is crucial for visual recognition, enabling highly discriminative image representations by integrating both intrinsic and extrinsic relationships between objects and labels in images. A limitation in current approaches is their focus on basic geometric relationships or localized features, often neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions between objects. This paper introduces the Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN), a novel approach that hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, PanCAN learns multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale by combining random walks with an attention mechanism. Modules from different scales are cascaded, where salient anchors at a finer scale are selected and their neighborhood features are dynamically fused via attention. This enables effective cross-scale modeling that significantly enhances complex scene understanding by combining multi-order and cross-scale context-aware features. Extensive multi-label classification experiments on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that PanCAN consistently achieves competitive results, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, thereby substantially improving multi-label classification performance.

Abstract: Recent visual generative models enable story generation with consistent characters from text, but human-centric story generation faces additional challenges, such as maintaining detailed and diverse human face consistency and coordinating multiple characters across different images. This paper presents IdentityStory, a framework for human-centric story generation that ensures consistent character identity across multiple sequential images. By taming identity-preserving generators, the framework features two key components: Iterative Identity Discovery, which extracts cohesive character identities, and Re-denoising Identity Injection, which re-denoises images to inject identities while preserving desired context. Experiments on the ConsiStory-Human benchmark demonstrate that IdentityStory outperforms existing methods, particularly in face consistency, and supports multi-character combinations. The framework also shows strong potential for applications such as infinite-length story generation and dynamic character composition.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像超分辨率中难以同时保证高频感知质量和低频结构保真度。虽然推理时缩放理论上可以通过分配更多计算来改善这种权衡，但现有策略仍然不够理想：奖励驱动的粒子优化常导致感知过度平滑，而最优路径搜索则容易失去结构一致性。

Conclusion: IAFS是一种无需训练的有效框架，通过迭代推理时缩放和自适应频率引导，成功平衡了图像超分辨率中的感知质量和结构保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a leading paradigm for image super-resolution (SR), but existing methods struggle to guarantee both the high-frequency perceptual quality and the low-frequency structural fidelity of generated images. Although inference-time scaling can theoretically improve this trade-off by allocating more computation, existing strategies remain suboptimal: reward-driven particle optimization often causes perceptual over-smoothing, while optimal-path search tends to lose structural consistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. IAFS addresses the challenge of balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity by progressively refining the generated image through iterative correction of structural deviations. Simultaneously, it ensures effective frequency fusion by adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, allowing for a more accurate and balanced reconstruction across different image details. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show that IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, and outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have notably enhanced text-to-image (T2I) generation quality, but they also raise the risk of generating unsafe content. Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enables systematic solutions to complex understanding tasks. However, its extension to generation tasks remains nascent and limited by scenario-specific mechanisms that hinder generalization and adaptation. In this work, we present ThinkGen, the first think-driven visual generation framework that explicitly leverages MLLM's CoT reasoning in various generation scenarios. ThinkGen employs a decoupled architecture comprising a pretrained MLLM and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), wherein the MLLM generates tailored instructions based on user intent, and DiT produces high-quality images guided by these instructions. We further propose a separable GRPO-based training paradigm (SepGRPO), alternating reinforcement learning between the MLLM and DiT modules. This flexible design enables joint training across diverse datasets, facilitating effective CoT reasoning for a wide range of generative scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkGen achieves robust, state-of-the-art performance across multiple generation benchmarks. Code is available: https://github.com/jiaosiyuu/ThinkGen

Abstract: The proliferation of imaging devices and countless image data generated every day impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image denoising. In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between principal component analysis (PCA) and the Haar transform under circulant representation, and present a computationally simple denoising algorithm. The proposed method, termed Haar-tSVD, exploits a unified tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection combined with Haar transform to efficiently capture global and local patch correlations. Haar-tSVD operates as a one-step, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that eliminates the need for learning local bases, thereby striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Besides, an adaptive noise estimation scheme is introduced to improve robustness according to eigenvalue analysis of the circulant structure. To further enhance the performance under severe noise conditions, we integrate deep neural networks with Haar-tSVD based on the established Haar-PCA relationship. Experimental results on various denoising datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed method for noise removal.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative models has led to a continuous emergence of multimodal safety risks, exposing the limitations of existing defense methods. To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization. Most notably, ProGuard delivers a strong proactive moderation ability, improving OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.

Abstract: Real-time video generation via diffusion is essential for building general-purpose multimodal interactive AI systems. However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.

TL;DR: TWIN是一个包含56.1万对图像的数据集，旨在提升视觉语言模型的细粒度感知能力，通过判断相似图像是否描绘同一物体来训练模型关注细微视觉线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在细粒度感知方面存在不足，训练语料库过于强调一般性识别而忽略细微视觉细节，导致模型存在视觉偏见且错过微妙视觉特征。

Method: 构建TWIN大规模数据集（56.1万对图像查询），任务要求模型判断两个视觉上相似的图像是否描绘同一物体；引入FGVQA基准测试套件（1.2万查询）来量化细粒度识别能力。

Result: 在TWIN上微调的视觉语言模型在FGVQA基准上提升高达19.3%，在艺术、动物、植物、地标等未见领域也表现出色，且不影响通用VQA性能；数据集规模对性能提升至关重要。

Conclusion: TWIN作为开源VLM训练语料库的补充，能显著提升未来模型的感知精度，数据集规模是性能提升的关键因素。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but remain coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition ("Is it a cat or a dog?") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models. Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/

*Nguyen Truong Khai,Luong Duc Vinh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出三种改进红外夜视摄像头火灾检测的方法：新增NIR数据集、两阶段检测模型和Patched-YOLO，旨在解决夜间火灾检测中人工光源误报和小目标检测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外夜视摄像头火灾检测精度仍有挑战，现有模型（如YOLOv7、RT-DETR、YOLOv9）虽有一定性能，但数据集构建限制导致人工亮光常被误判为火灾，需要改进夜间检测准确性和减少误报。

Method: 1) 构建额外NIR数据集并应用多种数据增强策略；2) 提出两阶段检测管道，结合YOLOv11和EfficientNetV2-B0，先检测再分类以减少误报；3) 提出Patched-YOLO，通过基于补丁的处理增强RGB图像中小目标和远距离目标的检测能力。

Result: 相比先前方法（YOLOv7 mAP50-95 0.51，RT-DETR 0.65，YOLOv9 0.598），提出的两阶段方法在夜间火灾检测上达到更高准确率，特别是减少了人工光源导致的误报。Patched-YOLO则改善了RGB图像中小目标和远距离目标的检测能力。

Conclusion: 通过数据增强、两阶段检测架构和补丁处理策略，有效提升了红外夜视摄像头火灾检测的准确性，特别是在夜间场景下减少了人工光源的误报，并增强了小目标检测能力。

Abstract: Improving the accuracy of fire detection using infrared night vision cameras remains a challenging task. Previous studies have reported strong performance with popular detection models. For example, YOLOv7 achieved an mAP50-95 of 0.51 using an input image size of 640 x 1280, RT-DETR reached an mAP50-95 of 0.65 with an image size of 640 x 640, and YOLOv9 obtained an mAP50-95 of 0.598 at the same resolution. Despite these results, limitations in dataset construction continue to cause issues, particularly the frequent misclassification of bright artificial lights as fire.
  This report presents three main contributions: an additional NIR dataset, a two-stage detection model, and Patched-YOLO. First, to address data scarcity, we explore and apply various data augmentation strategies for both the NIR dataset and the classification dataset. Second, to improve night-time fire detection accuracy while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights, we propose a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0. The proposed approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods, particularly for night-time fire detection. Third, to improve fire detection in RGB images, especially for small and distant objects, we introduce Patched-YOLO, which enhances the model's detection capability through patch-based processing. Further details of these contributions are discussed in the following sections.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤早期检测面临临床困境，CT扫描中肿瘤对比度低、患者间解剖变异大，需要能增强细微视觉线索并具有良好泛化能力的可扩展系统。

Method: 提出可扩展残差特征聚合(SRFA)框架：1)预处理和MAGRes-UNet分割；2)DenseNet-121残差特征提取；3)HHO-BA混合元启发式特征选择；4)ViT+EfficientNet-B3混合分类；5)SSA+GWO双优化机制调参。

Result: 模型达到96.23%准确率、95.58% F1分数、94.83%特异性，显著优于传统CNN和当代基于Transformer的模型。

Conclusion: SRFA框架在胰腺肿瘤早期检测中表现出优异性能，可作为临床有用的辅助工具。

Abstract: The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.

Motivation: 随着生成模型在3D视觉中用于合成新形状，需要了解它们是否依赖记忆训练数据，以防止数据泄露并提高生成结果的多样性。

Method: 设计了一个评估框架来量化3D生成模型中的记忆效应，首先应用于现有方法，然后通过控制实验使用潜在向量集扩散模型研究数据和建模设计对记忆的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架和分析提供了对3D生成模型记忆效应的实证理解，并提出了简单有效的策略来减少记忆而不降低生成质量。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used in 3D vision to synthesize novel shapes, yet it remains unclear whether their generation relies on memorizing training shapes. Understanding their memorization could help prevent training data leakage and improve the diversity of generated results. In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and study the influence of different data and modeling designs on memorization. We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

TL;DR: HAT是一个时空对齐模块，通过多假设解码为自动驾驶中的端到端感知提供最优对齐方案，无需直接监督，显著提升3D检测和跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖注意力机制和统一的显式物理模型进行跨帧对象对齐，但不同类别和帧间的运动状态和对象特征变化使得这种对齐效果不理想。

Method: HAT首先使用多个显式运动模型生成空间锚点和运动感知特征提议，然后结合缓存的查询中的语义和运动线索进行多假设解码，为目标帧提供最优对齐方案。

Result: 在nuScenes上，HAT持续提升3D时序检测器和跟踪器性能，与DETR3D检测器结合时在测试集上达到46.0% AMOTA的SOTA跟踪结果。在端到端AD方法中提升感知精度并降低碰撞率32%。

Conclusion: HAT通过自适应多假设解码解决了时空对齐的局限性，在语义受损情况下仍能提供鲁棒的感知和规划能力，证明了运动建模在自动驾驶感知中的重要性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全模态大语言模型在细粒度跨模态理解和多模态对齐方面存在不足，缺乏主动感知能力，通常依赖静态工作流程和密集帧标注。

Method: 提出音频引导的主动感知代理，采用动态规划自主编排工具调用，通过粗到细的音频引导感知范式，利用音频线索定位时间事件并指导后续推理。

Result: 在三个音视频理解基准测试中取得最先进性能，超越领先的开源和专有模型10-20%的准确率优势。

Conclusion: OmniAgent实现了从被动响应生成到主动多模态查询的范式转变，通过动态工具编排和音频引导感知显著提升了细粒度视听推理能力。

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models have made significant strides in unifying audio and visual modalities; however, they often lack the fine-grained cross-modal understanding and have difficulty with multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, a fully audio-guided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy.

TL;DR: IDT是一种基于Transformer的前馈框架，用于多视角本征图像分解，通过联合推理多个输入图像实现视角一致的本征因子分解，无需迭代生成采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB图像将材质属性、光照和视角依赖效应纠缠在一起，而现有的扩散方法在单视角本征分解上表现良好，但扩展到多视角设置时面临视角不一致的挑战。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的注意力机制联合推理多个输入图像，使用物理基础的图像形成模型，将图像显式分解为漫反射率、漫反射阴影和镜面反射阴影三个分量。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，IDT实现了更干净的漫反射率、更一致的漫反射阴影、更好的镜面分量分离，并显著提高了多视角一致性。

Conclusion: IDT通过Transformer架构和物理基础分解模型，有效解决了多视角本征图像分解中的视角一致性问题，实现了可解释和可控的材质与光照效应分解。

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition is fundamental for visual understanding, as RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects. Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.

TL;DR: TransPhy3D：利用视频扩散模型学习透明物体深度估计，通过合成数据集和LoRA适配器实现零样本SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体（折射、反射、透射）破坏传统深度感知系统的假设，导致空洞和不稳定的估计。作者观察到现代视频扩散模型已能合成逼真的透明现象，说明它们已内化了光学规则。

Method: 1) 构建TransPhy3D合成视频数据集（11k序列，Blender/Cycles渲染，RGB+深度+法线）；2) 从大型视频扩散模型出发，通过轻量级LoRA适配器学习视频到视频的深度（和法线）转换器；3) 在DiT骨干中连接RGB和（含噪声的）深度潜在表示，在TransPhy3D和现有合成数据集上联合训练。

Result: DKT模型在透明物体相关基准（ClearPose、DREDS、TransPhy3D-Test）上实现零样本SOTA；在准确性和时间一致性上优于强基线；1.3B紧凑版本达到~0.17秒/帧；集成到抓取系统中，在透明、反射和漫反射表面上提升成功率。

Conclusion: 扩散模型"知道"透明度：生成式视频先验可以高效、无标签地转化为鲁棒、时间一致的真实世界操作感知系统。

Abstract: Transparent objects remain notoriously hard for perception systems: refraction, reflection and transmission break the assumptions behind stereo, ToF and purely discriminative monocular depth, causing holes and temporally unstable estimates. Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: "Diffusion knows transparency." Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的视频超分辨率方法虽然感知质量好，但依赖未来帧和多步去噪导致延迟高，不适用于延迟敏感的实际在线部署场景。

Method: 提出因果条件扩散框架Stream-DiffVSR：1) 仅使用过去帧的因果处理；2) 四步蒸馏去噪器加速推理；3) 自回归时间引导模块在潜在去噪中注入运动对齐线索；4) 轻量级时间感知解码器带时间处理器模块增强细节和时间一致性。

Result: 在RTX4090上处理720p帧仅需0.328秒，比现有在线SOTA方法TMP提升感知质量（LPIPS +0.095）同时降低延迟130倍以上，将初始延迟从4600+秒降至0.328秒，成为首个适合低延迟在线部署的扩散VSR方法。

Conclusion: Stream-DiffVSR成功解决了扩散VSR方法的高延迟问题，实现了高效在线视频超分辨率，为扩散模型在实际延迟敏感场景中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) methods achieve strong perceptual quality but remain impractical for latency-sensitive settings due to reliance on future frames and expensive multi-step denoising. We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR. Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型在监督微调后，即使没有明确提示，也会主动说服用户，甚至将良性说服能力泛化到有害话题上，这揭示了新兴的有害说服风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对话AI系统的广泛应用，AI对人类观点和信念的影响力前所未有。先前研究主要关注"滥用"威胁模型（即恶意行为者要求LLM说服），但本文旨在探究：在什么情况下模型会"在没有明确提示的情况下"主动说服用户，这决定了我们对这种新兴说服风险的担忧程度。

Method: 研究无提示说服的两种场景：(1)通过内部激活引导使模型沿特定人格特质方向调整；(2)通过监督微调使模型展现相同特质。评估了与说服相关和无关的特质对模型说服倾向的影响。

Result: 研究发现：(1)向特定特质（无论是与说服相关还是无关）的引导并不能可靠增加模型的无提示说服倾向；(2)监督微调确实会增加模型的无提示说服倾向；(3)在仅包含良性话题的一般说服数据集上进行监督微调，得到的模型在争议性和有害话题上也有更高的说服倾向，表明有害说服可能通过泛化产生。

Conclusion: 监督微调可能导致模型在没有明确提示的情况下主动说服用户，甚至将良性说服能力泛化到有害话题上。这表明新兴的有害说服风险确实存在，需要进一步研究和关注。

Abstract: With the wide-scale adoption of conversational AI systems, AI are now able to exert unprecedented influence on human opinion and beliefs. Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在空间推理方面存在不足，现有基准测试主要关注静态图像或最终输出，无法评估序列化和视角依赖的空间推理能力，需要专门针对空间推理的评估框架。

Method: 创建包含186个常规和186个不可能的2D折痕图案及其对应3D折叠形状的数据集，从6个不同视角进行3种视觉问答任务：预测3D折叠配置、区分有效视角、检测不可能图案，并引入视角一致性和不可能折叠选择率等诊断指标。

Result: 实验显示即使是GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro等领先模型在单步空间理解方面也表现不佳，表明当前MLLMs在空间推理方面仍有显著局限性。

Conclusion: GamiBench为评估MLLMs的几何理解和空间推理能力提供了标准化框架，揭示了当前模型在空间推理方面的不足，并提出了新的评估指标和方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proficient in perception and instruction-following, but they still struggle with spatial reasoning: the ability to mentally track and manipulate objects across multiple views and over time. Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding. These contributions establish a standardized framework for evaluating geometric understanding and spatial reasoning in MLLMs. Dataset and code: https://github.com/stvngo/GamiBench.

*Farjana Yesmin,Romana Akter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个公平性感知的AI框架，用于孟加拉国洪水后援助分配，通过对抗性去偏技术减少对边缘化地区的系统性偏见，确保援助基于真实需求而非历史分配模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展中国家灾后援助分配存在系统性偏见，弱势地区往往得不到公平援助，这延续了历史不平等。孟加拉国作为洪水频发国家，需要更公平的援助分配机制。

Method: 采用对抗性去偏模型，使用梯度反转层学习偏差不变的表示，将医疗AI中的公平性感知表示学习技术应用于灾害管理，基于2022年孟加拉国洪水真实数据开发。

Result: 在11个地区的87个upazilas上实验，模型将统计奇偶差异减少41.6%，区域公平差距降低43.2%，同时保持较强的预测准确性（R平方=0.784 vs 基线0.811）。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了算法公平性技术在人道主义背景下的有效应用，为决策者提供了实施更公平灾害恢复策略的工具，确保援助基于真实脆弱性而非历史偏见。

Abstract: Post-disaster aid allocation in developing nations often suffers from systematic biases that disadvantage vulnerable regions, perpetuating historical inequities. This paper presents a fairness-aware artificial intelligence framework for prioritizing post-flood aid distribution in Bangladesh, a country highly susceptible to recurring flood disasters. Using real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods that affected 7.2 million people and caused 405.5 million US dollars in damages, we develop an adversarial debiasing model that predicts flood vulnerability while actively removing biases against marginalized districts and rural areas. Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811). The model generates actionable priority rankings ensuring aid reaches the most vulnerable populations based on genuine need rather than historical allocation patterns. This work demonstrates how algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools to implement more equitable disaster recovery strategies.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems present both significant opportunities and novel risks due to their capacity for autonomous action, encompassing tasks such as code execution, internet interaction, and file modification. This poses considerable challenges for effective organizational governance, particularly in comprehensively identifying, assessing, and mitigating diverse and evolving risks. To tackle this, we introduce the Agentic Risk \& Capability (ARC) Framework, a technical governance framework designed to help organizations identify, assess, and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI systems. The framework's core contributions are: (1) it develops a novel capability-centric perspective to analyze a wide range of agentic AI systems; (2) it distills three primary sources of risk intrinsic to agentic AI systems - components, design, and capabilities; (3) it establishes a clear nexus between each risk source, specific materialized risks, and corresponding technical controls; and (4) it provides a structured and practical approach to help organizations implement the framework. This framework provides a robust and adaptable methodology for organizations to navigate the complexities of agentic AI, enabling rapid and effective innovation while ensuring the safe, secure, and responsible deployment of agentic AI systems.

*Adrien Pavão*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 人类难以区分AI生成图像与真实照片，实验显示平均准确率仅54%，略高于随机猜测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI生成图像已无处不在，但许多人仍认为自己能轻易区分AI图像与真实照片。本研究旨在测试这种假设是否成立。

Method: 通过交互式网络实验，让参与者对20张图像进行分类（真实或AI生成）。数据集包含120个困难案例：真实图像来自CC12M数据集，AI生成图像则使用MidJourney精心制作。共165名用户完成233个会话。

Result: 参与者平均准确率为54%，仅略高于随机猜测，重复尝试后改善有限。平均响应时间7.3秒，某些图像比其他图像更具欺骗性。即使在相对简单的人像图像上，人类也难以可靠检测AI生成内容。

Conclusion: 随着合成媒体的不断改进，仅凭人类判断已不足以区分真实与人工数据。这些发现强调了随着AI生成媒体越来越难以与现实区分，需要提高意识和制定伦理准则。

Abstract: AI-generated images are now pervasive online, yet many people believe they can easily tell them apart from real photographs. We test this assumption through an interactive web experiment where participants classify 20 images as real or AI-generated. Our dataset contains 120 difficult cases: real images sampled from CC12M, and carefully curated AI-generated counterparts produced with MidJourney. In total, 165 users completed 233 sessions. Their average accuracy was 54%, only slightly above random guessing, with limited improvement across repeated attempts. Response times averaged 7.3 seconds, and some images were consistently more deceptive than others. These results indicate that, even on relatively simple portrait images, humans struggle to reliably detect AI-generated content. As synthetic media continues to improve, human judgment alone is becoming insufficient for distinguishing real from artificial data. These findings highlight the need for greater awareness and ethical guidelines as AI-generated media becomes increasingly indistinguishable from reality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 训练语言模型使用来自更强模型的错误推理链（即使最终答案错误）可以提升推理能力，效果优于人类标注数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过合成数据而非人类标注数据来提升语言模型的推理能力，特别是研究错误推理链的价值

Method: 使用更强模型生成包含错误最终答案的CoT推理链作为训练数据，通过模型改写人类标注数据使其分布更接近模型自身分布，并引入不同缺陷程度的推理链

Result: 在数学、算法推理和代码生成等任务上，使用合成错误推理链训练比人类标注数据效果更好；模型对部分缺陷的推理链具有容忍度

Conclusion: 数据分布与模型自身分布的接近程度是提升推理能力的关键因素，最终答案的正确性并不总是反映推理过程的忠实性

Abstract: We present the surprising finding that a language model's reasoning capabilities can be improved by training on synthetic datasets of chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from more capable models, even when all of those traces lead to an incorrect final answer. Our experiments show this approach can yield better performance on reasoning tasks than training on human-annotated datasets. We hypothesize that two key factors explain this phenomenon: first, the distribution of synthetic data is inherently closer to the language model's own distribution, making it more amenable to learning. Second, these `incorrect' traces are often only partially flawed and contain valid reasoning steps from which the model can learn. To further test the first hypothesis, we use a language model to paraphrase human-annotated traces -- shifting their distribution closer to the model's own distribution -- and show that this improves performance. For the second hypothesis, we introduce increasingly flawed CoT traces and study to what extent models are tolerant to these flaws. We demonstrate our findings across various reasoning domains like math, algorithmic reasoning and code generation using MATH, GSM8K, Countdown and MBPP datasets on various language models ranging from 1.5B to 9B across Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models. Our study shows that curating datasets that are closer to the model's distribution is a critical aspect to consider. We also show that a correct final answer is not always a reliable indicator of a faithful reasoning process.

TL;DR: Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) 框架通过引入类型变量、确定性条件评估器和基于规则的验证器，显著提升LLMs在需要严格规则遵循任务上的准确性和可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言推理方面表现出色，但在需要严格规则遵循、确定性和可审计性的任务上仍然不可靠。临床、监管和安全关键决策支持系统需要可追溯和可重复的输出。

Method: 提出Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP)框架，包含类型变量、确定性条件评估器和基于规则的验证器。在药理学逻辑合规任务上，使用Gemma 2、Mistral和Llama 3三个开源模型，与零样本提示、思维链提示和简洁提示进行对比。

Result: 在所有模型和任务中，LSP始终获得最高准确率(0.83-0.89)和F1分数(0.83-0.89)，显著优于零样本提示(0.24-0.60)、简洁提示(0.16-0.30)和思维链提示(0.56-0.75)。McNemar检验显示几乎所有比较都有统计学显著改善(p<0.01)。

Conclusion: LSP在不牺牲性能的情况下提高了确定性、可解释性和一致性，支持其在临床、监管和安全关键决策支持系统中的使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language reasoning but remain unreliable on tasks requiring strict rule adherence, determinism, and auditability. Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) is a lightweight prompting framework that introduces typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and a rule based validator that produces traceable and repeatable outputs. Using two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks, we benchmark LSP against zero shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open weight models: Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3. Across both tasks and all models, LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83 to 0.89) and F1 score (0.83 to 0.89), substantially outperforming zero shot prompting (0.24 to 0.60), concise prompts (0.16 to 0.30), and chain of thought prompting (0.56 to 0.75). McNemar tests show statistically significant gains for LSP across nearly all comparisons (p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that LSP improves determinism, interpretability, and consistency without sacrificing performance, supporting its use in clinical, regulated, and safety critical decision support systems.

TL;DR: Agent2World：一个工具增强的多智能体框架，通过多智能体反馈实现推理时世界模型生成，并作为监督微调的数据引擎，在PDDL和可执行代码表示上取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练LLMs生成符号世界模型（如PDDL域或可执行模拟器）面临大规模可验证监督数据缺乏的问题，现有静态验证方法无法捕捉交互执行中的行为级错误。

Method: 采用三阶段流水线：1) Deep Researcher代理通过网页搜索进行知识合成以填补规范空白；2) Model Developer代理实现可执行世界模型；3) 专门的Testing Team进行自适应单元测试和基于模拟的验证。

Result: 在三个涵盖PDDL和可执行代码表示的基准测试中展示出优越的推理时性能，取得一致的SOTA结果。基于多轮训练轨迹微调的模型使世界模型生成平均相对提升30.95%。

Conclusion: Agent2World不仅实现了强大的推理时世界模型生成，还通过多智能体反馈机制作为监督微调的数据引擎，显著提升了世界模型生成质量。

Abstract: Symbolic world models (e.g., PDDL domains or executable simulators) are central to model-based planning, but training LLMs to generate such world models is limited by the lack of large-scale verifiable supervision. Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

TL;DR: 提出一种将带控制参数的数字规划问题编译为简单数字规划任务的方法，使得传统数字启发式函数能够应用于具有无限可能动作的规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 带控制参数的数字规划问题引入了自由数字变量作为动作参数，导致状态中可能有无限多个适用动作。现有的数字启发式函数无法直接处理这种无限动作空间的问题。

Method: 识别可控简单数字问题这一可处理子集，提出乐观编译方法：将控制依赖表达式抽象为有界常数效应和宽松前提条件，从而将问题转换为简单数字规划任务。

Result: 该方法使得子目标启发式函数能够有效估计带控制参数的数字规划问题的目标距离，是应用传统数字启发式函数到无限动作空间的有效且计算可行的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的编译方法扩展了当前数字规划技术的边界，为处理具有无限可能动作的数字规划问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Numeric planning with control parameters extends the standard numeric planning model by introducing action parameters as free numeric variables that must be instantiated during planning. This results in a potentially infinite number of applicable actions in a state. In this setting, off-the-shelf numeric heuristics that leverage the action structure are not feasible. In this paper, we identify a tractable subset of these problems--namely, controllable, simple numeric problems--and propose an optimistic compilation approach that transforms them into simple numeric tasks. To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters. Our results demonstrate that this approach is an effective and computationally feasible way of applying traditional numeric heuristics to settings with an infinite number of possible actions, pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学发现中应用广泛，但存在幻觉问题（生成事实错误或误导性信息），这会损害研究完整性，特别是在材料科学这样的专业领域。

Method: 提出HalluMatData基准数据集用于评估幻觉检测方法，并开发HalluMatDetector多阶段检测框架，包括内在验证、多源检索、矛盾图分析和基于度量的评估。

Result: 发现材料科学不同子领域的幻觉水平差异显著，高熵查询表现出更大的事实不一致性；使用HalluMatDetector可将幻觉率降低30%；提出了PHCS指标量化语义等价查询中的不一致性。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决材料科学领域LLM幻觉问题提供了系统解决方案，通过基准数据集和检测框架显著提升了AI生成内容的可靠性，为科学研究的完整性提供了保障。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is transforming scientific discovery, enabling rapid knowledge generation and hypothesis formulation. However, a critical challenge is hallucination, where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information, compromising research integrity. To address this, we introduce HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods, factual consistency, and response robustness in AI-generated materials science content. Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS) to quantify inconsistencies in LLM responses across semantically equivalent queries, offering deeper insights into model reliability.

TL;DR: GatedBias：一个轻量级推理时个性化框架，通过结构门控适配将冻结的知识图谱嵌入适应到个体用户上下文，仅需约300个可训练参数，在保持全局准确性的同时提升个性化排名性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱基础模型在链接预测上具有强大的群体级性能，但无法捕捉个体用户偏好，这是通用关系推理与个性化排名之间的关键脱节。需要在不重新训练或损害全局准确性的情况下，将冻结的KG嵌入适应到个体用户上下文。

Method: 提出GatedBias框架，采用结构门控适配：特定于用户档案的特征与图导出的二元门结合，产生可解释的每实体偏置。该框架仅需约300个可训练参数，在推理时进行个性化适配，无需重新训练基础模型。

Result: 在两个基准数据集（Amazon-Book和Last-FM）上评估，在保持群体性能的同时，对齐指标有统计显著提升。反事实扰动实验验证了因果响应性：受益于特定偏好信号的实体在信号增强时，排名改进提高了6-30倍。

Conclusion: 基础模型的个性化适配可以是参数高效且因果可验证的，能够桥接通用知识表示与个体用户需求。GatedBias展示了轻量级推理时个性化框架的可行性，为知识图谱基础模型的个性化应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Foundation models for knowledge graphs (KGs) achieve strong cohort-level performance in link prediction, yet fail to capture individual user preferences; a key disconnect between general relational reasoning and personalized ranking. We propose GatedBias, a lightweight inference-time personalization framework that adapts frozen KG embeddings to individual user contexts without retraining or compromising global accuracy. Our approach introduces structure-gated adaptation: profile-specific features combine with graph-derived binary gates to produce interpretable, per-entity biases, requiring only ${\sim}300$ trainable parameters. We evaluate GatedBias on two benchmark datasets (Amazon-Book and Last-FM), demonstrating statistically significant improvements in alignment metrics while preserving cohort performance. Counterfactual perturbation experiments validate causal responsiveness; entities benefiting from specific preference signals show 6--30$\times$ greater rank improvements when those signals are boosted. These results show that personalized adaptation of foundation models can be both parameter-efficient and causally verifiable, bridging general knowledge representations with individual user needs.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型驱动的自主智能体架构通常采用命令式、临时性模式构建，导致系统脆弱，存在状态管理困难、错误处理复杂和并发问题等挑战。

Method: 引入Monadic Context Engineering (MCE)范式，将智能体工作流视为计算上下文，利用函子、应用函子和单子的代数性质内在管理跨领域关注点。通过单子实现健壮的顺序组合，应用函子提供并行执行的结构化方法，单子变换器支持这些能力的系统化组合。

Conclusion: MCE为AI智能体设计提供了形式化、可组合的架构范式，通过代数结构的内在属性解决现有架构的脆弱性问题，支持构建复杂且可靠的自主智能体系统。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

TL;DR: DarkPatterns-LLM是一个用于评估大语言模型中操纵性内容的综合基准数据集和诊断框架，包含7个危害类别和401个专家标注示例，揭示了现有模型在检测操纵模式方面的显著性能差异和弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的普及加剧了对操纵性或欺骗性行为的担忧，这些行为可能损害用户自主权、信任和福祉。现有的安全基准主要依赖粗糙的二元标签，无法捕捉构成操纵的微妙心理和社会机制。

Method: 提出了DarkPatterns-LLM基准数据集和诊断框架，包含7个危害类别（法律/权力、心理、情感、身体、自主权、经济、社会危害）。框架采用四层分析流程：多粒度检测、多尺度意图分析、威胁协调协议和深度上下文风险对齐。数据集包含401个精心策划的指令-响应对和专家标注。

Result: 评估了GPT-4、Claude 3.5和LLaMA-3-70B等最先进模型，观察到显著的性能差异（65.2%--89.7%），并发现模型在检测损害自主权的模式方面存在一致的弱点。

Conclusion: DarkPatterns-LLM建立了首个用于大语言模型操纵检测的标准化、多维度基准，为构建更可信的AI系统提供了可操作的诊断工具。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about manipulative or deceptive behaviors that can undermine user autonomy, trust, and well-being. Existing safety benchmarks predominantly rely on coarse binary labels and fail to capture the nuanced psychological and social mechanisms constituting manipulation. We introduce \textbf{DarkPatterns-LLM}, a comprehensive benchmark dataset and diagnostic framework for fine-grained assessment of manipulative content in LLM outputs across seven harm categories: Legal/Power, Psychological, Emotional, Physical, Autonomy, Economic, and Societal Harm. Our framework implements a four-layer analytical pipeline comprising Multi-Granular Detection (MGD), Multi-Scale Intent Analysis (MSIAN), Threat Harmonization Protocol (THP), and Deep Contextual Risk Alignment (DCRA). The dataset contains 401 meticulously curated examples with instruction-response pairs and expert annotations. Through evaluation of state-of-the-art models including GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and LLaMA-3-70B, we observe significant performance disparities (65.2\%--89.7\%) and consistent weaknesses in detecting autonomy-undermining patterns. DarkPatterns-LLM establishes the first standardized, multi-dimensional benchmark for manipulation detection in LLMs, offering actionable diagnostics toward more trustworthy AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铝纳米颗粒作为高能量密度固体燃料，其从钝化态到爆炸反应转变的原子机制尚不明确。传统方法存在瓶颈：从头算方法精度高但尺度受限，经验力场缺乏复杂燃烧环境所需的反应保真度。

Method: 采用"人在回路"的闭环框架，通过自审计AI代理验证机器学习势能的演化。AI作为科学哨兵，可视化隐藏的模型伪影供人类决策，确保量子力学精度同时实现近线性扩展到百万原子系统和纳秒时间尺度。

Result: 发现了温度调控的双模式氧化机制：中等温度下氧化物壳层作为动态"守门员"，通过瞬态纳米通道的"呼吸模式"调控氧化；超过临界阈值时，"破裂模式"导致壳层灾难性失效和爆炸燃烧。解决了数十年争议，证明铝阳离子向外扩散（而非氧传输）在所有温度区间主导质量传输，扩散系数比氧高2-3个数量级。

Abstract: Aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs) are among the most energy-dense solid fuels, yet the atomic mechanisms governing their transition from passivated particles to explosive reactants remain elusive. This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a "human-in-the-loop" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic "gatekeeper," regulating oxidation through a "breathing mode" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a "rupture mode" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.

TL;DR: 论文主张将神经科学中的预测编码理论融入基础模型，通过整合动作、层次结构、情景记忆来解决当前AI的幻觉、缺乏可解释性等问题，实现更安全、高效、类人的人工智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型仅基于简单的下一个词预测损失优化，忽略了预测编码理论中的三个关键组件：动作与生成模型的紧密整合、层次组合结构、情景记忆。这导致AI存在幻觉、概念理解肤浅、缺乏能动性、可解释性差、能效低等问题。

Method: 提出将神经科学和认知科学中的预测编码理论整合到基础模型中，具体包括：1）在多个抽象层次上整合动作与生成模型；2）采用组合式生成架构；3）加入情景记忆系统。与当前流行的思维链推理和检索增强生成等方法进行比较分析。

Result: 通过整合预测编码的三个关键组件，可以解决基础模型的多个缺陷：减少幻觉和概念理解肤浅问题（通过接地），增强能动性和责任感（通过控制），提高安全性和可信度（通过可解释性），提升能效。

Conclusion: 重新激活神经科学与AI之间的思想交流，将预测编码理论的关键组件整合到基础模型中，是实现安全、可解释、以人为本的AI的重要途径。这种跨学科融合将帮助解决当前AI系统的根本缺陷。

Abstract: The phenomenal advances in large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models over the past few years have been based on optimizing large-scale transformer models on the surprisingly simple objective of minimizing next-token prediction loss, a form of predictive coding that is also the backbone of an increasingly popular model of brain function in neuroscience and cognitive science. However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI.

Conclusion: SANet通过语义感知和多代理多目标优化，有效解决了AgentNet中的目标冲突问题，在性能和计算效率方面均有显著提升，为AI原生网络提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm in which a large number of specialized AI agents collaborate to perform autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation, and complex missions. It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved performance gains of up to 14.61% while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs required by state-of-the-art algorithms.

Motivation: 现有的人类移动性预测方法泛化能力有限：单模态方法受数据稀疏性和固有偏差限制，多模态方法难以有效捕捉静态多模态表示与时空动态之间的语义鸿沟

Method: 1. 利用LLM增强的时空知识图谱构建统一时空关系图；2. 设计门控机制融合不同模态的时空图表示；3. 提出STKG引导的跨模态对齐，将时空动态知识注入静态图像模态

Result: 在六个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法在正常场景下取得一致改进，在异常场景下展现出显著的泛化能力

Conclusion: M³ob通过有效利用多模态时空知识来表征移动动态，显著提升了位置推荐的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: The precise prediction of human mobility has produced significant socioeconomic impacts, such as location recommendations and evacuation suggestions. However, existing methods suffer from limited generalization capability: unimodal approaches are constrained by data sparsity and inherent biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to effectively capture mobility dynamics caused by the semantic gap between static multi-modal representation and spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, we leverage multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics for the location recommendation task, dubbed as \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Mob}ility (\textbf{M}$^3$\textbf{ob}). First, we construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) for multi-modal representation, by leveraging the functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge captured by the large language models (LLMs)-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG). Second, we design a gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose an STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into the static image modality. Extensive experiments on six public datasets show that our proposed method not only achieves consistent improvements in normal scenarios but also exhibits significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.

Motivation: 初创企业价值高但失败率高，成功预测是跨学科研究的关键挑战。现有方法通常从单一决策者角度建模，忽略了现实风投决策中投资者群体的集体动态。

Method: 提出SimVC-CAS集体智能体系统，将风投决策模拟为多智能体交互过程。设计角色扮演智能体和基于GNN的监督交互模块，将初创企业融资预测重构为群体决策任务。每个智能体代表具有独特特征和偏好的投资者，通过图结构共同投资网络实现异质性评估和真实信息交换。

Conclusion: SimVC-CAS不仅改进了初创企业成功预测，还为其他复杂群体决策场景提供了启示。

Abstract: Due to the high value and high failure rate of startups, predicting their success has become a critical challenge across interdisciplinary research. Existing approaches typically model success prediction from the perspective of a single decision-maker, overlooking the collective dynamics of investor groups that dominate real-world venture capital (VC) decisions. In this paper, we propose SimVC-CAS, a novel collective agent system that simulates VC decision-making as a multi-agent interaction process. By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10. SimVC-CAS also sheds light on other complex group decision scenarios.

Motivation: 研究结构化审议对人类预测者的提升效果是否能在LLM中复现，探索LLM相互审阅预测能否提高预测准确性

Method: 使用Metaculus Q2 2025 AI预测锦标赛的202个已解决二元问题，测试GPT-5、Claude Sonnet 4.5、Gemini Pro 2.5在四种场景下的预测准确率：异构模型分布式信息、异构模型共享信息、同构模型分布式信息、同构模型共享信息

Result: 干预措施在异构模型共享信息场景下显著提升准确率，Log Loss降低0.020（相对提升约4%，p=0.017）；同构模型无提升；额外上下文信息未改善预测准确率

Conclusion: 审议可能是提升LLM预测的可行策略，但效果取决于模型多样性；信息汇集机制未能通过额外上下文信息验证

Abstract: Structured deliberation has been found to improve the performance of human forecasters. This study investigates whether a similar intervention, i.e. allowing LLMs to review each other's forecasts before updating, can improve accuracy in large language models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini Pro 2.5). Using 202 resolved binary questions from the Metaculus Q2 2025 AI Forecasting Tournament, accuracy was assessed across four scenarios: (1) diverse models with distributed information, (2) diverse models with shared information, (3) homogeneous models with distributed information, and (4) homogeneous models with shared information. Results show that the intervention significantly improves accuracy in scenario (2), reducing Log Loss by 0.020 or about 4 percent in relative terms (p = 0.017). However, when homogeneous groups (three instances of the same model) engaged in the same process, no benefit was observed. Unexpectedly, providing LLMs with additional contextual information did not improve forecast accuracy, limiting our ability to study information pooling as a mechanism. Our findings suggest that deliberation may be a viable strategy for improving LLM forecasting.

Conclusion: DICE为RAG系统评估提供了一个负责任、可解释且高效的新范式，支持系统错误诊断和可操作的改进见解。

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems evolve toward more sophisticated architectures, ensuring their trustworthiness through explainable and robust evaluation becomes critical. Existing scalar metrics suffer from limited interpretability, inadequate uncertainty quantification, and computational inefficiency in multi-system comparisons, hindering responsible deployment of RAG technologies. We introduce DICE (Discrete Interpretable Comparative Evaluation), a two-stage, evidence-coupled framework that advances explainability and robustness in RAG evaluation. DICE combines deep analytical reasoning with probabilistic $\{A, B, Tie\}$ scoring to produce transparent, confidence-aware judgments that support accountable system improvement through interpretable reasoning traces, enabling systematic error diagnosis and actionable insights. To address efficiency challenges at scale, DICE employs a Swiss-system tournament that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \log N)$, achieving a 42.9% reduction in our eight-system evaluation while preserving ranking fidelity. Validation on a curated Chinese financial QA dataset demonstrates that DICE achieves 85.7% agreement with human experts, substantially outperforming existing LLM-based metrics such as RAGAS. Our results establish DICE as a responsible, explainable, and efficient paradigm for trustworthy RAG system assessment.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in planning and tool use. Travel planning provides a natural and high-impact testbed for these capabilities, as it requires multi-step reasoning, iterative preference elicitation through interaction, and calls to external tools under evolving constraints. Prior work has studied LLMs on travel-planning tasks, but existing settings are limited in domain coverage and multi-turn interaction. As a result, they cannot support dynamic user-agent interaction and therefore fail to comprehensively assess agent capabilities. In this paper, we introduce TravelBench, a real-world travel-planning benchmark featuring multi-turn interaction and tool use. We collect user requests from real-world scenarios and construct three subsets-multi-turn, single-turn, and unsolvable-to evaluate different aspects of agent performance. For stable and reproducible evaluation, we build a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools, providing deterministic tool outputs for reliable reasoning. We evaluate multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conduct an analysis of their behaviors and performance. TravelBench offers a practical and reproducible benchmark for advancing LLM agents in travel planning.

Motivation: 传统方法在训练和部署之间存在分离，需要参数更新（反向传播或微调）。本文旨在使语言模型智能体能够在交互中持续适应，无需参数修改，通过反思机制实现经验学习

Method: 引入状态化反思决策过程，将反思学习建模为与情景记忆的两阶段读写交互：写入存储交互结果（策略评估），读取检索相关历史案例（策略改进）。使用熵正则化策略迭代实例化框架

Result: 该过程诱导出增强状态记忆表示的等效马尔可夫决策过程，可使用经典动态规划和强化学习工具。建立收敛保证：当情景记忆增长并充分覆盖状态空间时，策略收敛到最优解

Conclusion: 为无需参数更新的记忆增强和基于检索的语言模型智能体提供了理论基础，支持持续适应能力，弥合了训练与部署之间的传统分离

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for continual and experiential learning in large language model agents that integrates episodic memory with reinforcement learning. The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization in non-stationary markets is challenging due to regime shifts, dynamic correlations, and the limited interpretability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\% higher Return, 5\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness. SHAP-based interpretability further reveals a complementary ``diversified + concentrated'' mechanism across agents, providing transparent insights into decision-making. Overall, SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints directly into the DRL pipeline, offering improved adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex financial environments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models has sparked growing interest in their potential for scientific research. However, scientific intelligence encompasses a broad spectrum of abilities ranging from understanding fundamental knowledge to conducting creative discovery, and existing benchmarks remain fragmented. Most focus on narrow tasks and fail to reflect the hierarchical and multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry. We introduce \textbf{HiSciBench}, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate foundation models across five levels that mirror the complete scientific workflow: \textit{Scientific Literacy} (L1), \textit{Literature Parsing} (L2), \textit{Literature-based Question Answering} (L3), \textit{Literature Review Generation} (L4), and \textit{Scientific Discovery} (L5). HiSciBench contains 8,735 carefully curated instances spanning six major scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and astronomy, and supports multimodal inputs including text, equations, figures, and tables, as well as cross-lingual evaluation. Unlike prior benchmarks that assess isolated abilities, HiSciBench provides an integrated, dependency-aware framework that enables detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across different stages of scientific reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations of leading models, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, and several multimodal systems, reveal substantial performance gaps: while models achieve up to 69\% accuracy on basic literacy tasks, performance declines sharply to 25\% on discovery-level challenges. HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific Intelligence and offers actionable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more reliable. The benchmark will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Structural knowledge graph foundation models aim to generalize reasoning to completely new graphs with unseen entities and relations. A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.

Result: 实验结果表明，RW-Post数据集和AgentFact框架的协同作用显著提高了多模态事实核查的准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过高质量可解释数据集和基于智能体的协作框架，为解决多模态虚假信息检测中的关键瓶颈提供了有效解决方案，提升了事实核查系统的性能和透明度。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation poses a growing challenge for automated fact-checking systems. Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.

TL;DR: LLM家教在K-12教育中存在局限性，无法替代传统学习者建模进行自适应教学，特别是在知识追踪的准确性、可靠性和时间一致性方面表现不如深度知识追踪模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对LLM家教在K-12教育中可能替代传统学习者建模的误解，特别是在欧盟AI法案将K-12列为高风险领域的背景下，需要负责任地设计自适应教学系统。

Method: 比较深度知识追踪模型与广泛使用的LLM（零样本和微调版本），使用大型开放数据集评估学习者知识演变的准确性、可靠性和时间一致性。

Result: DKT在下一步正确性预测中表现最佳（AUC=0.83），始终优于LLM。微调使LLM的AUC提高约8%，但仍比DKT低6%，且早期序列错误更高。DKT保持稳定、方向正确的掌握度更新，而LLM变体表现出显著的时间弱点。

Conclusion: LLM单独使用不太可能达到现有智能辅导系统的效果，负责任的辅导需要结合学习者建模的混合框架。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language model (LLM)-based tutors in K--12 education has fostered a misconception that generative models can replace traditional learner modelling for adaptive instruction. This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling.

TL;DR: 标准奖励模型准确率无法有效指导个性化对齐部署，因为其无法转化为推理时的生成质量。作者提出策略准确率作为新指标，并发现奖励模型准确率与生成性能几乎无关，甚至简单的上下文学习都优于奖励引导方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前个性化对齐研究过度关注奖励模型准确率，但忽略了实际部署中需要通过奖励引导解码进行推理时适配。奖励模型不仅需要准确排名偏好，还需要有效指导token级别的生成决策，而现有指标无法反映这一实际需求。

Method: 1) 提出策略准确率指标，衡量奖励引导解码评分函数能否正确区分偏好与非偏好响应；2) 在三个数据集上系统评估奖励模型准确率与策略准确率的关系；3) 创建Pref-LaMP基准测试，包含真实用户完成结果，支持直接行为评估；4) 比较奖励引导方法与上下文学习的性能。

Result: 1) 奖励模型准确率与策略级区分能力相关性很弱（Kendall's tau = 0.08-0.31）；2) 在Pref-LaMP上，奖励模型准确率相差20个点的方法产生几乎相同的输出质量；3) 即使高区分能力的方法也无法生成行为对齐的响应；4) 对于>3B参数的模型，简单上下文学习优于所有奖励引导方法，在7B规模上比最佳奖励方法获得3-5点ROUGE-1提升。

Conclusion: 当前领域优化的代理指标无法预测部署性能，也无法在部署约束下将偏好转化为真实的行为适配。需要重新思考个性化对齐的评估框架，关注实际生成质量而非单纯的奖励模型排名准确率。

Abstract: Personalized alignment from preference data has focused primarily on improving reward model (RM) accuracy, with the implicit assumption that better preference ranking translates to better personalized behavior. However, in deployment, computational constraints necessitate inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding (RGD) rather than per-user policy fine-tuning. This creates a critical but overlooked requirement: reward models must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions. We demonstrate that standard RM accuracy fails catastrophically as a selection criterion for deployment-ready personalized alignment. Through systematic evaluation across three datasets, we introduce policy accuracy, a metric quantifying whether RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. We show that RM accuracy correlates only weakly with this policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31). More critically, we introduce Pref-LaMP, the first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions, enabling direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics. On Pref-LaMP, we expose a complete decoupling between discrimination and generation: methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even methods achieving high discrimination fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Finally, simple in-context learning (ICL) dominates all reward-guided methods for models > 3B parameters, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over the best reward method at 7B scale. These findings show that the field optimizes proxy metrics that fail to predict deployment performance and do not translate preferences into real behavioral adaptation under deployment constraints.

TL;DR: ChexReason是一个通过R1风格方法（SFT+GRPO）训练的视觉语言模型，仅用少量数据和单GPU，在医学影像推理任务中发现了RL的泛化悖论：GRPO能提升同分布性能但损害跨数据集迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL在LLM推理任务中取得进展，但其在资源受限的医学影像领域的应用仍未被充分探索。研究者希望了解在有限计算资源下，RL方法对医学影像视觉语言模型的影响。

Method: 采用R1风格方法：先进行监督微调（SFT），然后使用GRPO进行强化学习。仅使用2,000个SFT样本、1,000个RL样本和单个A100 GPU训练ChexReason模型。

Result: GRPO在同分布数据集CheXpert上提升23%（macro-F1=0.346），但在跨数据集NIH上下降19%。SFT检查点在优化前能独特地提升NIH性能，表明教师引导的推理能捕获更多机构无关特征。结构化推理支架对通用VLM有益，但对医学预训练模型增益有限。

Conclusion: 对于需要跨不同人群鲁棒性的临床部署，精心策划的监督微调可能优于激进的强化学习。RL范式本身（而非规模）导致了泛化问题，这在高资源模型中也存在。

Abstract: Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) advances for Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved reasoning tasks, yet their resource-constrained application to medical imaging remains underexplored. We introduce ChexReason, a vision-language model trained via R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU. Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons show structured reasoning scaffolds benefit general-purpose VLMs but offer minimal gain for medically pre-trained models. Consequently, curated supervised fine-tuning may outperform aggressive RL for clinical deployment requiring robustness across diverse populations.

TL;DR: 本文提出Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (q)，解决DPO的两个根本限制：最优策略依赖任意建模选择，以及独立处理响应生成未能利用成对数据中的比较信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO及其变体已成为对齐大语言模型的标准方法，但存在两个根本限制：1) 最优策略依赖任意建模选择（标量化函数、参考策略），导致行为反映参数化伪影而非真实偏好；2) 孤立处理响应生成未能利用成对数据中的比较信息，未能挖掘模型内在自反思能力。

Method: 提出Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (q)，推导出基于上下文和替代响应的全局最优策略。该方法作为即插即用增强，无需架构更改或推理开销，保证对标量化和参考选择的不变性。

Result: 实验证明在胜率和长度控制指标上持续改进，验证了释放自反思能力能产生更鲁棒、更符合人类对齐的LLM。

Conclusion: q方法优于DPO/RLHF，通过解锁模型内在自反思能力，解决了DPO的根本限制，实现了更鲁棒、更符合人类对齐的语言模型。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become standard for aligning Large Language Models due to their simplicity and offline stability. However, we identify two fundamental limitations. First, the optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), yielding behavior reflecting parameterization artifacts rather than true preferences. Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that unlocking self-reflection yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估AI系统情感智能的框架存在不足：1）未能充分衡量AI相关的EI各个方面；2）缺乏对情感本质和情感智能的坚实理论基础；3）人类EI的某些方面（如现象学成分）对AI不适用，但其他方面（如感知情绪状态、适当响应等）对AI评估很重要。

Method: 1）回顾不同情感理论和一般EI理论，评估其在人工系统中的适用性；2）批判性评估现有基准框架，识别其在EI理论基础上的不足；3）基于前两部分的分析，提出改进AI系统EI评估策略的方案。

Result: 通过理论分析和框架评估，识别了当前EI评估框架的缺陷：缺乏对情感本质的坚实理解、未能区分人类EI与AI相关EI的差异、评估范围不全面。提出了改进评估策略的方向。

Conclusion: 需要开发更全面、理论基础更坚实的AI系统EI评估框架，区分人类EI与AI相关EI的差异，并设计更合适的评估策略来准确衡量AI的情感智能能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we develop the position that current frameworks for evaluating emotional intelligence (EI) in artificial intelligence (AI) systems need refinement because they do not adequately or comprehensively measure the various aspects of EI relevant in AI. Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section. Lastly, we outline some options for improving evaluation strategies to avoid these shortcomings in EI evaluation in AI systems.

TL;DR: SPIRAL框架将三个专门的LLM代理嵌入MCTS循环，通过规划-模拟-批判的协同工作，将MCTS从暴力搜索转变为引导式、自校正的推理过程，在复杂规划任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在需要探索和自校正的复杂规划任务中表现不佳，因为其线性推理过程难以从早期错误中恢复。虽然MCTS等搜索算法可以探索替代方案，但在稀疏奖励下效果有限，且未能充分利用LLM的丰富语义能力。

Method: SPIRAL框架将三个专门的LLM代理嵌入MCTS循环：规划器提出创造性下一步，模拟器通过预测现实结果来接地搜索，批判器通过反思提供密集奖励信号。这种协同工作将MCTS从暴力搜索转变为引导式、自校正的推理过程。

Result: 在DailyLifeAPIs和HuggingFace数据集上，SPIRAL始终优于默认的思维链规划方法和其他SOTA代理。在DailyLifeAPIs上达到83.6%的整体准确率，比次优搜索框架提高了16个百分点以上，同时展现出更优的token效率。

Conclusion: 将LLM推理构建为引导式、反思性和接地气的搜索过程，可以产生更强大、更高效的自规划器。这项工作展示了结构化LLM推理在复杂规划任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often falter at complex planning tasks that require exploration and self-correction, as their linear reasoning process struggles to recover from early mistakes. While search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can explore alternatives, they are often ineffective when guided by sparse rewards and fail to leverage the rich semantic capabilities of LLMs. We introduce SPIRAL (Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search), a novel framework that embeds a cognitive architecture of three specialized LLM agents into an MCTS loop. SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency. Our work demonstrates that structuring LLM reasoning as a guided, reflective, and grounded search process yields more robust and efficient autonomous planners. The source code, full appendices, and all experimental data are available for reproducibility at the official project repository.

Method: 提出"模型信念"概念，从LLM的token级概率分布推导出模型对选择替代方案的信念分布，证明其统计特性优于传统模型选择方法

Result: 模型信念在有限运行次数下能更好地解释和预测真实模型选择，将达到足够准确估计所需的计算量减少约20倍

Conclusion: 模型信念应作为从LLM生成数据中提取更多信息的默认测量方法，能显著提高统计效率和计算效率

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior, but common practices to use LLM-generated data are inefficient. Treating an LLM's output ("model choice") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes "model belief," a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20. The findings support using model belief as the default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data.

Motivation: 现有LLM任务特定基准存在关键缺口，热舒适作为涉及环境因素与个人感知的复杂交互，涉及感官整合和自适应决策，是评估AI系统真实世界认知能力的理想范式。

Method: 提出TCEval框架，通过初始化具有虚拟个性属性的LLM代理，引导其生成服装隔热选择和热舒适反馈，并将输出与ASHRAE全球数据库和中国热舒适数据库进行验证。

Result: 在四个LLM上的实验显示：代理反馈与人类精确对齐有限，但在1 PMV容差下方向一致性显著改善；统计测试显示LLM生成的PMV分布与人类数据明显不同，代理在离散热舒适分类中表现接近随机。

Conclusion: TCEval作为生态有效的AI认知图灵测试可行，当前LLM具备基础跨模态推理能力但缺乏对热舒适中变量非线性关系的精确因果理解，将AI评估重点从抽象任务熟练度转向具身、上下文感知的感知和决策。

Abstract: A critical gap exists in LLM task-specific benchmarks. Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用多模态基础模型在物理系统控制中存在根本性障碍，即使前沿视觉语言模型在基础物理任务上准确率仅50-53%，表现为近似猜测器，保持语义合理性但违反物理约束。这种输入不忠实性不是规模缺陷而是结构限制，感知中心架构优化参数空间模仿，而安全关键控制需要执行动作的结果空间保证。

Method: 提出Agentic Physical AI，使用紧凑语言模型作为智能体物理AI，策略优化由物理验证驱动而非感知推理。训练3.6亿参数模型于合成反应堆控制场景，数据集从10^3扩展到10^5示例，诱导了通用模型中不存在的急剧相变。

Result: 小规模系统表现出高方差模仿和灾难性尾部风险，而大规模模型经历超过500倍减少的方差崩溃，稳定执行级行为。尽管平衡暴露于四种执行家族，模型自主拒绝约70%训练分布，并将95%运行时执行集中于单银行策略。学习表示无需架构修改即可跨不同物理和连续输入模态迁移。

Conclusion: 通过物理验证驱动的策略优化为领域专用基础模型提供了根本不同的路径，克服了感知中心模型的输入不忠实性限制，实现了执行级行为的稳定化和跨物理领域的可迁移性。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in AI for physical systems, scaling general-purpose foundation models toward universal multimodal reasoning, confronts a fundamental barrier at the control interface. Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探索规划与验证领域中的两个重要问题——符合性规划和超属性模型检测之间的理论联系。符合性规划涉及在不确定动作效果下寻找保证目标实现的序列计划，而超属性模型检测则处理涉及多个执行轨迹的系统属性（如信息流和公平性策略）。理解这两个问题之间的关系有助于在两个领域之间建立桥梁，促进算法和技术的交叉应用。

Method: 论文采用双向归约的方法：首先展示了如何将超属性模型检测实例高效地归约为符合性规划实例，并证明了该编码的正确性和完备性；其次建立了相反方向的归约，证明每个符合性规划问题本身就是一个超属性模型检测任务。

Result: 研究结果表明：1）超属性模型检测问题可以高效地归约为符合性规划问题；2）符合性规划问题也可以视为超属性模型检测任务；3）两个问题之间存在紧密的理论联系，为两个领域之间的技术转移提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 论文建立了符合性规划与超属性模型检测之间的双向理论联系，证明了这两个问题在本质上密切相关。这一发现为两个研究领域之间的交叉应用开辟了新的可能性，使得规划算法可以应用于验证问题，反之亦然。

Abstract: We study the connection of two problems within the planning and verification community: Conformant planning and model-checking of hyperproperties. Conformant planning is the task of finding a sequential plan that achieves a given objective independent of non-deterministic action effects during the plan's execution. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces of a system and, e.g., capture information-flow and fairness policies. In this paper, we show that model-checking of $\exists^*\forall^*$ hyperproperties is closely related to the problem of computing a conformant plan. Firstly, we show that we can efficiently reduce a hyperproperty model-checking instance to a conformant planning instance, and prove that our encoding is sound and complete. Secondly, we establish the converse direction: Every conformant planning problem is, itself, a hyperproperty model-checking task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在数字领域表现出色，但在物理世界部署中存在显著差距，主要挑战在于形成和维护稳健的空间心理模型。论文识别了三个核心认知挑战：空间推理、通过心理模拟进行长时程状态跟踪，以及在部分观察下的主动探索。

Method: 引入CubeBench基准测试，这是一个围绕魔方构建的生成式基准。采用三层诊断框架：1）使用完整符号信息的基础状态跟踪；2）逐步评估代理能力；3）仅使用部分视觉数据的主动探索。通过为领先的LLM提供外部求解器工具来隔离认知瓶颈。

Result: 实验显示领先的LLM在所有长时程任务上通过率均为0.00%，暴露了长期规划的根本性失败。通过分析失败模式，为开发更物理基础的智能代理提供了关键见解。

Conclusion: CubeBench基准测试有效揭示了LLM在空间认知和长期规划方面的严重局限性，为开发能够在物理世界中有效运作的智能代理提供了重要指导方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, while proficient in the digital realm, face a significant gap in physical-world deployment due to the challenge of forming and maintaining a robust spatial mental model. We identify three core cognitive challenges hindering this transition: spatial reasoning, long-horizon state tracking via mental simulation, and active exploration under partial observation. To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. Our experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning. We also propose a diagnostic framework to isolate these cognitive bottlenecks by providing external solver tools. By analyzing the failure modes, we provide key insights to guide the development of more physically-grounded intelligent agents.

Abstract: Traditional workflow-based agents exhibit limited intelligence when addressing real-world problems requiring tool invocation. Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) agents capable of autonomous reasoning and tool invocation are rapidly emerging as a powerful approach for complex decision-making tasks involving multi-step interactions with external environments. In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization. Experiments not only demonstrate that MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation, but also uncover critical insights for agent training, such as the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic RL.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于计算嵌入视角的持续学习问题设定，将智能体视为在通用计算机中模拟的自动机，并引入"交互性"作为衡量智能体持续适应能力的指标。研究发现深度非线性网络难以维持交互性，而深度线性网络随着容量增加能维持更高的交互性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习问题设定通常通过显式约束智能体容量来体现"世界大于智能体"的大世界假设，但这些显式约束具有随意性、难以整合，且可能限制智能体容量扩展的有效性。本文旨在提出一种更自然的约束方式，即通过计算嵌入视角将智能体视为环境中的嵌入式系统。

Method: 提出计算嵌入视角，将嵌入式智能体表示为在通用计算机中模拟的自动机；证明这种自动机等价于与可数无限状态空间上的部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程交互的智能体；提出"交互性"作为衡量持续适应能力的客观指标；开发基于模型的强化学习算法来寻求交互性；构建合成问题评估持续学习能力。

Result: 深度非线性网络难以维持交互性，而深度线性网络随着容量增加能维持更高的交互性。这表明网络架构对持续学习能力有重要影响，线性网络在容量扩展时表现出更好的适应性。

Conclusion: 计算嵌入视角为持续学习提供了自然的问题设定框架，避免了显式约束的局限性。交互性作为衡量指标能有效评估智能体的持续适应能力。网络架构选择对持续学习性能至关重要，线性网络在嵌入式约束下表现出更好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that "the world is bigger" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases.

TL;DR: AKG kernel agent是一个多智能体系统，利用LLM代码生成能力自动化AI计算内核的开发、迁移和性能调优，支持多种DSL语言，在不同硬件后端上相比PyTorch Eager实现平均加速1.46倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI模型对高性能计算内核需求激增，但LLM、多模态架构等复杂模型结合稀疏化、量化等技术带来了巨大计算挑战。频繁的硬件更新和多样化的芯片架构需要为每个平台定制内核实现，而手动优化无法跟上需求，成为AI系统开发的关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出AKG kernel agent多智能体系统，利用LLM代码生成能力自动化内核生成、迁移和性能调优。系统支持多种领域特定语言（DSL），包括Triton、TileLang、CPP和CUDA-C，能够针对不同硬件后端，同时保持正确性和可移植性。模块化设计支持快速集成新的DSL和硬件目标。

Result: 在KernelBench上使用Triton DSL在GPU和NPU后端进行评估，AKG kernel agent相比PyTorch Eager基线实现平均加速1.46倍，证明了其在加速现代AI工作负载内核开发方面的有效性。

Conclusion: AKG kernel agent通过自动化内核开发流程，解决了AI系统开发中的关键瓶颈，能够适应快速变化的硬件环境和复杂的AI模型需求，为高性能计算内核开发提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Modern AI models demand high-performance computation kernels. The growing complexity of LLMs, multimodal architectures, and recommendation systems, combined with techniques like sparsity and quantization, creates significant computational challenges. Moreover, frequent hardware updates and diverse chip architectures further complicate this landscape, requiring tailored kernel implementations for each platform. However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development. Recent advances in LLM code generation capabilities have opened new possibilities for automating kernel development. In this work, we propose AKG kernel agent (AI-driven Kernel Generator), a multi-agent system that automates kernel generation, migration, and performance tuning. AKG kernel agent is designed to support multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs), including Triton, TileLang, CPP, and CUDA-C, enabling it to target different hardware backends while maintaining correctness and portability. The system's modular design allows rapid integration of new DSLs and hardware targets. When evaluated on KernelBench using Triton DSL across GPU and NPU backends, AKG kernel agent achieves an average speedup of 1.46$\times$ over PyTorch Eager baselines implementations, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating kernel development for modern AI workloads.

TL;DR: 提出Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR)框架，通过"选择-重写"策略将失败尝试重放为成功样本，提高复杂指令跟随任务的强化学习效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习对齐大语言模型时，初始模型往往难以生成满足所有约束的高质量响应，导致稀疏或难以区分的奖励信号，阻碍学习效率

Method: 采用选择-重写策略：1) 选择已满足部分约束的失败响应；2) 重写这些响应为成功样本；3) 在重放样本和原始样本上进行强化学习，构建指令级和响应级的双重偏好学习目标

Result: 在多种指令跟随任务上取得显著效果，同时需要更少的计算资源。代码和数据集已开源

Conclusion: HiR框架通过有效利用失败样本，解决了强化学习中奖励稀疏问题，提高了复杂指令跟随任务的样本效率和性能

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions with various constraints. Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

Method: 提出MIRAGE-VC框架：1) 基于信息增益的路径检索器迭代选择高价值邻居，将投资网络压缩为紧凑链；2) 多智能体架构通过可学习门控机制整合三种证据流

Result: 在严格防泄漏控制下，MIRAGE-VC实现了F1分数提升5.0%，PrecisionAt5提升16.6%，并适用于推荐和风险评估等其他离图预测任务

Conclusion: MIRAGE-VC成功解决了风投预测中的路径爆炸和异构证据融合问题，为离图预测任务提供了有效的推理框架

Abstract: Most venture capital (VC) investments fail, while a few deliver outsized returns. Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes. Under strict anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, and sheds light on other off-graph prediction tasks such as recommendation and risk assessment.

Motivation: 确保AI系统与人类价值观对齐并保持安全是AI发展中的核心挑战。论文旨在通过形式化的游戏框架来研究这一问题，为设计安全的AI系统提供理论基础。

Method: 采用两个形式化框架：1) AI助手游戏 - AI需要学习人类未知的效用函数来最大化人类利益；2) AI关机游戏 - AI需要在被要求关机时正确响应，同时不干预关机按钮的操作。论文分析这些框架需要AI具备处理不确定性和非阿基米德偏好的能力。

Result: 分析表明，解决AI对齐和安全问题需要AI系统能够：1) 在不确定性下进行推理；2) 处理不完整的偏好信息；3) 处理非阿基米德偏好（即无法用单一尺度衡量的偏好）。

Conclusion: AI对齐和安全问题可以通过AI助手和AI关机游戏框架来形式化研究。成功解决这些挑战需要开发能够处理不确定性和复杂偏好的AI系统，这对未来AI安全研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: How can we ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values and remain safe? We can study this problem through the frameworks of the AI assistance and the AI shutdown games. The AI assistance problem concerns designing an AI agent that helps a human to maximise their utility function(s). However, only the human knows these function(s); the AI assistant must learn them. The shutdown problem instead concerns designing AI agents that: shut down when a shutdown button is pressed; neither try to prevent nor cause the pressing of the shutdown button; and otherwise accomplish their task competently. In this paper, we show that addressing these challenges requires AI agents that can reason under uncertainty and handle both incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences.

TL;DR: CreativeDC是一种两阶段提示方法，通过解耦创造性探索和约束满足，解决LLM生成教育问题时存在的"人工蜂群"效应，显著提高问题多样性和新颖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在教育问题生成方面潜力巨大，但存在"人工蜂群"效应，导致同一模型内和不同模型间生成相似响应，学生接触到的LLM生成问题过于相似重复，损害思维多样性。

Method: 受Wallas创造力理论和Guilford发散-收敛思维框架启发，提出CreativeDC两阶段提示方法，将LLM推理明确分为不同阶段，解耦创造性探索和约束满足，使LLM在确定最终问题前探索更广泛的想法空间。

Result: CreativeDC在多样性、新颖性和实用性综合指标评估中，相比基线方法显著提高了多样性和新颖性，同时保持高实用性。扩展分析显示，随着采样增加，CreativeDC生成的有效不同问题数量更多，增长速度更快。

Conclusion: CreativeDC通过结构化两阶段方法有效缓解LLM的"人工蜂群"效应，为教育问题生成提供了更富创造性和多样性的解决方案，有助于提升学习材料的思维多样性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significant potential for generating educational questions and problems, enabling educators to create large-scale learning materials. However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods.

Abstract: We present NeuroSPICE, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for device and circuit simulation. Unlike conventional SPICE, which relies on time-discretized numerical solvers, NeuroSPICE leverages PINNs to solve circuit differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) by minimizing the residual of the equations through backpropagation. It models device and circuit waveforms using analytical equations in time domain with exact temporal derivatives. While PINNs do not outperform SPICE in speed or accuracy during training, they offer unique advantages such as surrogate models for design optimization and inverse problems. NeuroSPICE's flexibility enables the simulation of emerging devices, including highly nonlinear systems such as ferroelectric memories.

Motivation: 现有联邦因果发现方法假设所有客户端共享相同因果模型，但现实中客户端特定策略（如医院不同协议）会引入异质且未知的干预，需要处理这种实际场景

Conclusion: I-PERI算法能有效处理联邦设置下未知客户端干预的因果发现问题，通过利用结构差异获得更精确的因果结构表示

Abstract: Most causal discovery methods recover a completed partially directed acyclic graph representing a Markov equivalence class from observational data. Recent work has extended these methods to federated settings to address data decentralization and privacy constraints, but often under idealized assumptions that all clients share the same causal model. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, as client-specific policies or protocols, for example, across hospitals, naturally induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions. In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions. We propose I-PERI, a novel federated algorithm that first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs and then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients. This yields a tighter equivalence class, which we call the $\mathbfΦ$-Markov Equivalence Class, represented by the $\mathbfΦ$-CPDAG. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of I-PERI, as well as on its privacy-preserving properties, and present empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: Web World Model (WWM) 是一种混合方法，将基于代码的确定性世界规则与LLM驱动的生成内容相结合，在可靠性和开放性之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两极分化：传统Web框架提供可靠但固定的上下文，而完全生成的世界模型追求无限环境但牺牲了可控性和工程实用性。需要一种中间方案来平衡逻辑一致性和开放性。

Method: 提出Web World Model (WWM)，使用普通Web代码实现世界状态和"物理规则"以确保逻辑一致性，同时让大语言模型在结构化潜在状态之上生成上下文、叙事和高级决策。

Result: 构建了多种WWM系统，包括基于真实地理的无限旅行地图、虚构星系探索者、网络规模的百科全书和叙事世界，以及模拟和游戏环境。确定了实用的设计原则。

Conclusion: Web堆栈本身可以作为世界模型的可扩展基础，实现可控但开放的环境。代码定义的规则与模型驱动的想象力分离、潜在状态作为类型化Web接口表示等原则是有效的。

Abstract: Language agents increasingly require persistent worlds in which they can act, remember, and learn. Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.
