We present the NeurOptimiser, a fully spike-based\noptimisation framework that materialises the neuromorphic-based metaheuristic\nparadigm through a decentralised NC system. The proposed approach comprises a\npopulation of Neuromorphic Heuristic Units (NHUs), each combining spiking\nneuron dynamics with spike-triggered perturbation heuristics to evolve\ncandidate solutions asynchronously. The NeurOptimiser's coordination arises\nthrough native spiking mechanisms that support activity propagation, local\ninformation sharing, and global state updates without external orchestration.\nWe implement this framework on Intel's Lava platform, targeting the Loihi 2\nchip, and evaluate it on the noiseless BBOB suite up to 40 dimensions. We\ndeploy several NeurOptimisers using different configurations, mainly\nconsidering dynamic systems such as linear and Izhikevich models for spiking\nneural dynamics, and fixed and Differential Evolution mutation rules for\nspike-triggered heuristics. Although these configurations are implemented as a\nproof of concept, we document and outline further extensions and improvements\nto the framework implementation.

Their\npotential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant\nresearch on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal\nLLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially\nwhen compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to\ninsufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper\naims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image\nmodels, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a\nnovel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating\nimages that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text\nprompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable\nDiffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and\nStable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro\n1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions\ngenerated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used\nto generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the\nText-to-Image models.

Despite recent research efforts, existing\nQFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their\napplicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple\nmodalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel\nmultimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the\nintermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major\nbottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during\ntraining can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality\nAgnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring\nstable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that\nthe proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy\nof 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID\ndata distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u673a\u5236\uff08MMA\uff09\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728IID\u548c\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e866.84%\u548c7.25%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08QFL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001QFL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165MMA\u673a\u5236\u9694\u79bb\u672a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u72b6\u6001\u6c61\u67d3\u3002", "result": "\u5728IID\u548c\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53476.84%\u548c7.25%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001QFL\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7MMA\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

The\nresults demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European\ncities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately\none building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent\nstate-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased\nvariability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,\nparticularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of\nhigh-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL\nfor robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building\nheight estimation from single VHR SAR data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5355\u5e45VHR SAR\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u4f30\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u5927\u9646\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f30\u7b97\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u8de8\u5927\u9646\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5355\u5e45VHR SAR\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u4f30\u7b97\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b27\u6d32\u57ce\u5e02\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff08MAE\u7ea62.20\u7c73\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e9a\u6d32\u57ce\u5e02\u56e0\u9ad8\u697c\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u7c7b\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7a0d\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5355\u5e45VHR SAR\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u8de8\u5927\u9646\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f30\u7b97\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle\nwith sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward\nGaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to\nincorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a\n3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse\nviews. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into\na globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an\nentropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal\ntransport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an\nalignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.\nFurthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the\n$\\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This\nenables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating\ncamera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets\ndemonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high\nfidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view\nsynthesis.

However,\nthe improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering\ncharacteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target\ndetection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,\nthe inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to\nblind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately\ndegrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that\nincorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection\nmodel, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To\nbe specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature\nAdaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA\nmodule is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and\nachieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the\ninterpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module\nis proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure\nadjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source\ndomain to the target domain.

While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content\nsynthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,\ntemporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing\nstable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate\ntalking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video\npreprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This\nframework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current\nlimitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating\noptimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline\nto extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region\nsegmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.\nTo ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling\nstrategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid\n(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion\nconsistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,\nthereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In\naddition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively\nrefine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video\ngeneration.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation\nquality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian\nwhile with 150 FPS inference speed.

Nevertheless,\nits performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image\nand in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of\nannotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context\npairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible\ndue to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address\nthis challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework\nthat enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling\nself-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual\nalignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model\ninitially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the\nroles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to\nvalidate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context\nimage. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure\nof the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to\nalter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the\nalignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven\nmedical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,\ndemonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight\nCCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution\nfor universal medical image segmentation.

Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific\narchitectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo\nmatching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any\ntwo-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D\ndisplacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a\nformulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures\nor task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration\nby endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented\ngeneralization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a\nrobust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and\npropose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features\nfrom Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view\nmatching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with\nnear 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature\nmatching domains to pretrain PanMatch.

This\npromotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in\nthe later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to\nfurther refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results\non subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that\nCoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all\nmetrics.

In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free\ncompression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,\ndistillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility\nacross model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,\nand compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel\ncompression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a\ndense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a\nlow-dimensional scalar.

By using memory-efficient training techniques, we\npre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on\nGenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.

We formalize this practical problem as \\textit{Continual-Temporal\nTest-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over\ntime.

However, 7T scanners are costly,\nscarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.\nWe propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize\n7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:\nOur model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding\n7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128\nslices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),\n19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145\nslices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,\nrespectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and\nResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-\n4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,\nand 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using\n10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter\nResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter\nResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T\n(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001).

To mitigate this we propose the\nuse of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)\nfeatures (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of\nthe total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various\nscales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,\northogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are\nempirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of\nlowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using\nlearners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we\nexamine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of\ncomputed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography\n(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases.

However, existing deep learning-based methods face two\nmajor challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,\nwhich limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity\nhierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in\npractice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused\nby sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU\nmodels to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop\nclassification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of\nLCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose\nHieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables\nmulti-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU\nmodels to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We\nintroduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism\n(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification\nmodels to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic\nconsistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a\ndual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:\nCross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment\n(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the\neffective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,\nwe construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset\nfeaturing pixel-wise annotations.
