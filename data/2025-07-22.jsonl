While their individual dynamics have been\nwidely studied, their coupled interactions, particularly in the context of ENSO\ncomplexity, including spatial diversity (Central Pacific vs. Eastern Pacific\nevents), temporal evolution (single-year and multi-year events), and intensity\nvariations (moderate to extreme events), have received limited attention in\nmodeling studies. In this paper, a simple intermediate coupled MJO-ENSO model\nis developed to address critical gaps in understanding their bidirectional\nfeedback and its role in modulating ENSO complexity. The model integrates\nmultiscale processes, bridging intraseasonal (MJO), interannual (ENSO), and\ndecadal (Walker circulation) variability. Key mechanisms include: (1)\ninterannual SST modulating MJO through latent heat and background states, (2)\nMJO-induced wind forcing triggering diverse ENSO events, and (3) decadal\nvariability modulating the strength and occurrence frequency of Eastern Pacific\nand Central Pacific events. Effective stochastic parameterizations are\nincorporated to improve the characterization of multiscale MJO-ENSO\ninteractions and the emergence of intermittency and extremes. The model\ncaptures several crucial observed MJO and ENSO features, including non-Gaussian\nstatistics, seasonal cycles, energy spectra, and spatial event patterns. It\nalso reproduces critical MJO-ENSO interactions: warm pool edge extension,\nconvective activity adjustments that modulate SST, and ENSO's dependence on\nMJO-driven easterly and westerly wind anomalies. The model provides a useful\ntool to analyze long-term variations. It also advances the understanding of\nENSO extreme events and their remote impacts, as well as seasonal forecasting\nand climate resilience."}

Two factors in future climate\nprojections could alter this dilemma: (i) an increased ratio of CO$_2$ forcing\nrelative to aerosol cooling, owing to both continued accumulation of CO$_2$ and\ndeclining aerosol emissions, and (ii) a warming world, whereby CO$_2$-induced\nwarming becomes more pronounced relative to climate variability. Here, we\ndevelop a novel modeling approach to explore the rates of learning about\nequilibrium climate sensitivity and the transient climate response (TCR) and\nidentify the physical drivers underpinning these learning rates. Our approach\nhas the advantage over past work by accounting for the full spectrum of\nparameter uncertainties and covariances, while also taking into account\nserially correlated internal climate variability. Moreover, we provide a\nphysical explanation of how quickly we may hope to learn about climate\nsensitivity. We find that, although we are able to constrain future TCR\nregardless of the true underlying value, constraining ECS is more difficult,\nwith low values of ECS being more easily ascertained than high values. This\nasymmetry can be explained by most of the warming this century being\nattributable to the fast climate mode, which is more useful for constraining\nTCR than it is for ECS. We further show that our inability to constrain the\ndeep ocean response is what limits our ability to learn high values of ECS."}

Recent methods based on cross-modal learning\nattempt to introduce instance images to aid the structure feature learning.\nHowever, they still focus on each particular input class, limiting their\ngeneration abilities.

Specifically, we design a Structural Shared Feature\nEncoder (SSFE) to jointly extract cross-modal features and reconstruct\nreference features as priors. Benefiting from a dual-channel control gate in\nthe encoder, relevant structural features in the reference sample are enhanced\nand irrelevant information interference is suppressed.

Traditionally, developers estimate story points\ncollaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the\ninitial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team\nhas converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious\nand labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with\nenough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,\nstate-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate\npredictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The\ngoal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a\ncomparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story\npoint prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to\nevery backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate\nwhich item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine\nlearning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically\nevaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects.\nThe model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34\nSpearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground\ntruth story points. This is similar to, if not better than, the performance of\na regression model learned from the ground truth story points. Therefore, the\nproposed comparative learning approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art\nregression-based approaches according to the law of comparative judgments -\nproviding comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden on humans than\nproviding ratings or categorical labels."}

We are thus motivated to develop a camera guidance system that\nprovides solutions and guidance for clutter identification and removal. We\nestimate and visualize the contribution of objects to the overall aesthetics\nand content of a photo, based on which users can interactively identify\nclutter. Suggestions on getting rid of clutter, as well as a tool that removes\ncluttered objects computationally, are provided to guide users to deal with\ndifferent kinds of clutter and improve their photographic work. Two technical\nnovelties underpin interactions in our system: a clutter distinguishment\nalgorithm with aesthetics evaluations for objects and an iterative image\ninpainting algorithm based on generative adversarial nets that reconstructs\nmissing regions of removed objects for high-resolution images. User studies\ndemonstrate that our system provides flexible interfaces and accurate\nalgorithms that allow users to better identify distractions and take higher\nquality images within less time."}

In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain\nvision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex\nchart reasoning.

Then we develop a two-stage training\nstrategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and\nChart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims\nto decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable\nsubtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for\nimproving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning.

Specifically, we design a Structural Shared Feature\nEncoder (SSFE) to jointly extract cross-modal features and reconstruct\nreference features as priors. Benefiting from a dual-channel control gate in\nthe encoder, relevant structural features in the reference sample are enhanced\nand irrelevant information interference is suppressed. In addition, we propose\na Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Generator (PRAG) that employs a hierarchical\nfeature fusion mechanism to integrate reference prior information with input\nfeatures from global to local.

This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors.

Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS).

We\nintroduce $\\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc, a dual-hierarchical relocalization framework\nthat follows a sparse-to-dense and coarse-to-fine paradigm, fully exploiting\nthe rich semantic information and geometric constraints inherent in Gaussian\nprimitives. To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate\npartitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic\nmemory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse\nstage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy\nand landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation,\nand (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine\ndense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification.\nThrough comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real\nflight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive\nlocalization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while\neffectively filtering unreliable pose estimates. The results confirm the\neffectiveness of our approach for practical remote sensing applications."}

All resources are available at\n  https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/WebGuard", "summary": "The rapid development of autonomous web agents powered by Large Language\nModels (LLMs), while greatly elevating efficiency, exposes the frontier risk of\ntaking unintended or harmful actions. This situation underscores an urgent need\nfor effective safety measures, akin to access controls for human users. To\naddress this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive\ndataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and\nfacilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In\ndoing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of\nstate-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193\nwebsites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail\nwebsites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema:\nSAFE, LOW, and HIGH. The dataset includes designated training and test splits\nto support evaluation under diverse generalization settings. Our initial\nevaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less\nthan 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in\nlagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying\ncurrent-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore\ninvestigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct\ncomprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that\na fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in\nperformance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from\n20% to 76%. Despite these improvements, the performance still falls short of\nthe reliability required for high-stakes deployment, where guardrails must\napproach near-perfect accuracy and recall."}

To address\nthese shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based\nagentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive\nX-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent\npositions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,\ncoordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the\nEvidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect\nregion proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through\nNon-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in\nX-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides\nthe LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating\ncontext assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,\nconfidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the\nSDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using\ntools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,\nenhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate\ndiverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset\ndemonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection\nF1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and\ntrustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of\nagentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks."}

Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning\nand code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their\nadvantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal\ndata type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in\ncomplex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain\nvision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex\nchart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic\ndata synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning\ndata covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of\nreasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training\nstrategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and\nChart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims\nto decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable\nsubtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for\nimproving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the\ntypical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft\nreward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity\nin the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks\nand self-built chart reasoning dataset (\\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental\nresults show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain\nmethods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\\emph{e.g.,\nGPT-4o, Claude-3.5})."}
