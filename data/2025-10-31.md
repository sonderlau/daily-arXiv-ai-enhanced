*David Donaire-Montaño,Matilde García-Valdecasas Ojeda,Nicolás Tacoronte,Juan José Rosa-Cánovas,Yolanda Castro-Díez,María Jesús Esteban-Parra,Sonia Raquel Gámiz-Fortis*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 本研究优化了Noah-MP陆面模型在伊比利亚半岛的配置，通过70次一年期模拟测试35种参数组合，识别出最佳配置方案s27I，能准确表征该地区的热通量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊比利亚半岛受水分限制机制主导，陆面模型在表征陆地-大气相互作用中起关键作用，需要优化Noah-MP模型配置以准确模拟该地区的热通量。

Method: 使用WRF v3.9.1作为区域气候模型，进行70次一年期模拟（包括干旱年2005和湿润年2010），测试35种Noah-MP参数组合，并与FLUXNET站点数据和CERRA-Land再分析数据对比评估。

Result: WRF/Noah-MP能较好再现伊比利亚半岛的土壤湿度和地表热通量，特别是在湿润条件下。聚类分析识别出10组配置，其中s27I配置（Jarvis CRS、Chen97 SFC、CLM-type BTR、BATS RUN和调整的Sellers RSF）表现最佳。

Conclusion: 冠层气孔阻力、地表热交换系数、土壤水分因子、径流和地下水以及地表阻力是影响模型性能的关键参数，动态植被也很重要，s27I配置为伊比利亚半岛热通量表征提供了良好方案。

Abstract: Land surface models (LSMs) play a crucial role in characterizing
land-atmosphere interactions by providing boundary conditions to regional
climate models (RCMs). This is particularly true over the Iberian Peninsula
(IP), where a water-limited regime governs much of the territory. We optimize
the configuration of the Noah land surface model with multiparameterization
options (Noah-MP) for characterizing heat fluxes in the IP when the Weather
Research and Forecasting (WRF) model v3.9.1 is used as an RCM. We perform 70
one-year simulations using 35 Noah-MP combinations, for a dry year (2005) and a
wet year (2010). Land-surface heat fluxes and soil moisture from WRF/Noah-MP
are evaluated against FLUXNET station data and the CERRA-Land reanalysis. In
general, WRF/Noah-MP reproduces soil moisture and surface heat fluxes well over
the IP, especially under wetter conditions. Clustering identifies an optimal
configuration from 10 groups (A to J). The Noah-MP options with greatest impact
are canopy stomatal resistance (CRS), surface exchange coefficient for heat
(SFC), soil-moisture factor controlling stomatal resistance (BTR), runoff and
groundwater (RUN), and surface resistance to evaporation/sublimation (RSF);
dynamic vegetation (DVEG) also matters. Several configurations performed
reasonably; experiment s27I (Jarvis CRS, Chen97 SFC, CLM-type BTR, BATS RUN,
and adjusted Sellers RSF for wet soils) provides a particularly good
characterization of heat fluxes over the IP.

### [2] [Fire Behavior Monitoring using MeteoSat Third Generation, FCI-FireDyn algorithm: Rate Of Spread and Burnt Area Dynamics for large fire event](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26677)
*Ronan Paugam,Akli Benali,Julia Harvie,Andrea Meraner,Niels Andela,Weidong Xu*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: FCI-FireDyn是一种利用Meteosat第三代卫星上的FCI传感器监测野火动态的新算法，能够以175米空间分辨率和2分钟时间间隔生成火线到达时间图、蔓延速率和燃烧面积演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高时空分辨率的野火动态监测方法，利用地球静止卫星的连续观测能力来支持实时火灾行为监测和建模应用。

Method: 结合基于阈值的中波红外检测和时空插值方法，在175米分辨率下重建火线推进和蔓延速率场。

Result: 在2024-2025年南欧三个重大火灾事件中测试，获取的燃烧面积和火势增长率与参考数据集吻合良好，总最终燃烧面积偏差低于20%。

Conclusion: FCI-FireDyn证明了从地球静止观测中获取高频火灾行为指标的可行性，尽管受FCI空间分辨率限制，但仍能提供足够覆盖来估计火线尺度的火灾动态。

Abstract: This study presents FCI-FireDyn, a new algorithm developed to monitor
wildfire dynamics using the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) onboard the Meteosat
Third Generation satellite. Leveraging the high temporal resolution of FCI
(10-minute full-disk observations), the algorithm derives fire arrival time
maps, rate of spread (ROS), and Burn Area (BA) evolution at sub-kilometer
spatial resolution and 2-minute temporal intervals. The method combines
threshold-based MWIR detection, spatio-temporal interpolation to reconstruct
fire front progression and ROS fields at 175 m resolution. FCI-FireDyn was
tested on three major fire events in Southern Europe (Portugal, Greece, and
France) from the 2024 2025 seasons. The retrieved BA and Fire Growth Rate show
good agreement with reference datasets from EFFIS, Copernicus EMS, and
PT-FireSprd, with total final BA deviations below 20%. The algorithm captures
distinct propagation phases, including acceleration episodes that precede FRP
peaks, highlighting a potential for NRT fire behavior monitoring. Despite
limitations due to FCI spatial resolution, results demonstrate that it provides
sufficient spatio-temporal coverage to estimate front-scale fire dynamics.
FCI-FireDyn thus represents a proof of concept for deriving high-frequency fire
behavior metrics from geostationary observations to support operational and
modeling applications.

TL;DR: 提出电压依赖性突触可塑性(VDSP)作为基于忆阻突触的高效无监督学习方法，无需复杂脉冲整形电路，在三种忆阻器件上验证了MNIST模式识别任务中83%以上的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决边缘AI设备面临的能耗和功能挑战，利用脑启发学习机制实现实时自适应和低功耗，忆阻内存计算在边缘AI工作负载中发挥关键作用。

Method: 引入电压依赖性突触可塑性(VDSP)方法，基于Hebbian原理实现无监督局部学习，在三种忆阻器件(TiO2、HfO2金属氧化物丝状突触、HfZrO4铁电隧道结)上验证，进行系统级脉冲神经网络仿真。

Result: 在MNIST模式识别任务中实现超过83%的准确率(使用200个神经元)，达到最先进性能，评估了器件变异性影响并提出了增强鲁棒性的缓解策略。

Conclusion: VDSP为忆阻突触提供了一种高效的无监督学习方法，能够在多种忆阻器件上实现高性能模式识别，为边缘AI设备的低功耗自适应学习提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of AI on edge computing devices faces significant challenges
related to energy consumption and functionality. These devices could greatly
benefit from brain-inspired learning mechanisms, allowing for real-time
adaptation while using low-power. In-memory computing with nanoscale resistive
memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of AI workloads on
these edge devices. In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic
plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning
in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online
learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary
for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be
advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO$_2$,
HfO$_2$-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO$_4$-based
ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching
characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks
incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on
MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
The results demonstrated over 83% accuracy across all devices using 200
neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as
switching thresholds and ratios between high and low resistance state levels,
and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.

### [4] [Advancing Forest Fires Classification using Neurochaos Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26383)
*Kunal Kumar Pant,Remya Ajai A S,Nithin Nagaraj*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出使用神经混沌学习(NL)算法进行森林火灾分类，该算法基于混沌理论，受大脑启发，在少量训练数据下能学习非线性模式，性能优于传统机器学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习和深度学习模型在森林火灾预测中准确率不足，无法充分捕捉自然界的非线性特性，且需要大量训练数据。需要更高效、数据需求更少的算法。

Method: 使用神经混沌学习(NL)算法，采用一维混沌映射(广义Lüroth序列)作为神经元，模拟大脑的随机性和异质性。特别提出了随机异质神经混沌学习(RHNL)变体。

Result: 在阿尔及利亚森林火灾数据集上获得最佳F1分数1.0，在加拿大和葡萄牙数据集上分别获得0.90和0.68的高精度分数。在低样本训练机制下表现优于传统ML和DL模型。

Conclusion: 神经混沌学习架构比传统机器学习分类器表现更好，具有可解释性，为开发更高效可靠的森林火灾检测系统提供了前景。

Abstract: Forest fires are among the most dangerous and unpredictable natural disasters
worldwide. Forest fire can be instigated by natural causes or by humans. They
are devastating overall, and thus, many research efforts have been carried out
to predict whether a fire can occur in an area given certain environmental
variables. Many research works employ Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning
(DL) models for classification; however, their accuracy is merely adequate and
falls short of expectations. This limit arises because these models are unable
to depict the underlying nonlinearity in nature and extensively rely on
substantial training data, which is hard to obtain. We propose using Neurochaos
Learning (NL), a chaos-based, brain-inspired learning algorithm for forest fire
classification. Like our brains, NL needs less data to learn nonlinear patterns
in the training data. It employs one-dimensional chaotic maps, namely the
Generalized L\"uroth Series (GLS), as neurons. NL yields comparable performance
with ML and DL models, sometimes even surpassing them, particularly in
low-sample training regimes, and unlike deep neural networks, NL is
interpretable as it preserves causal structures in the data. Random
Heterogenous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL), a type of NL where different chaotic
neurons are randomnly located to mimic the randomness and heterogeneity of
human brain gives the best F1 score of 1.0 for the Algerian Forest Fires
Dataset. Compared to other traditional ML classifiers considered, RHNL also
gives high precision score of 0.90 for Canadian Forest Fires Dataset and 0.68
for Portugal Forest Fires Dataset. The results obtained from this work indicate
that Neurochaos Learning (NL) architectures achieve better performance than
conventional machine learning classifiers, highlighting their promise for
developing more efficient and reliable forest fire detection systems.

### [5] [Wireless Sensor Networks as Parallel and Distributed Hardware Platform for Artificial Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26492)
*Gursel Serpen*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出使用无线传感器网络作为硬件平台来实现完全并行和最大分布式的人工神经网络计算系统


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统硅基或光基计算无法实现人工神经网络的并行分布式计算，限制了神经网络在大规模实时问题中的应用

Method: 利用具有板载处理和无线通信功能的无线传感器网络节点，构建大规模并行分布式硬件平台来实现ANN算法

Result: 能够实现大规模复杂问题的实时计算，在高度鲁棒的框架中运行

Conclusion: 这种实现将彻底改变计算方式，使实时解决大规模科学、工程和技术问题成为可能

Abstract: We are proposing fully parallel and maximally distributed hardware
realization of a generic neuro-computing system. More specifically, the
proposal relates to the wireless sensor networks technology to serve as a
massively parallel and fully distributed hardware platform to implement and
realize artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. A parallel and distributed
(PDP) hardware realization of ANNs makes it possible to have real time
computation of large-scale (and complex) problems in a highly robust framework.
We will demonstrate how a network of hundreds of thousands of processing nodes
(or motes of a wireless sensor network), which have on-board processing and
wireless communication features, can be used to implement fully parallel and
massively distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms for
solution of truly large-scale problems in real time. The realization of
artificial neural network algorithms in a massively parallel and fully
distributed hardware has been the goal of neural network computing researchers.
This is because a parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural
network algorithms could not have been achieved against all the advancements in
silicon- or optics-based computing. Accordingly, artificial neural networks
could not be applied to very large-scale problems for real time computation of
solutions. This hindered the development of neural algorithms for affordable
and practical solutions of challenging problems since often special-purpose
computing approaches in hardware, software or hybrid (non-neural) had to be
developed for and fine-tuned to specific problems that are very large-scale and
highly complex. Successful implementation is likely to revolutionize computing
as we know it by making it possible to solve very large scale scientific,
engineering or technical problems in real time.

### [6] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了时空建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习模型中对水下物体检测的有效性，比较了标准YOLOv5、时间增强的T-YOLOv5以及添加CBAM模块的T-YOLOv5的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决动态海洋环境中物体检测的挑战，特别是在突然运动、部分遮挡和渐进运动条件下，探索如何通过时空建模和注意力机制提高检测准确性。

Method: 第一阶段评估时间增强的T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能；第二阶段开发了添加卷积块注意力模块(CBAM)的T-YOLOv5增强版本，比较三种模型的检测效果。

Result: 测试结果显示，YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，而T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5+CBAM分别达到0.813和0.811，在复杂物体检测方面表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T-YOLOv5相比标准模型显著提高了检测可靠性，而T-YOLOv5+CBAM在挑战性场景中进一步提升了性能，但在简单场景下存在精度损失。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [7] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练期间让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，直接学习用户偏好，而不是事后选择生成的图像，从而提高了生成图像的视觉质量并加速了训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在大型未筛选数据集上训练，以实现多样化的生成能力，但这与用户偏好不一致。现有的奖励模型通过事后选择生成的图像来对齐奖励，但这会损害多样性、语义保真度和效率。

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练期间让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，直接学习用户偏好，而不是事后处理。

Result: MIRO在GenEval组合基准和用户偏好评分（PickAScore、ImageReward、HPSv2）上实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了生成图像的视觉质量并加速了训练。

Conclusion: 通过在训练期间直接学习用户偏好，MIRO方法在提高生成图像质量的同时，保持了多样性和语义保真度，并显著加快了训练速度。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

### [8] [BikeScenes: Online LiDAR Semantic Segmentation for Bicycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25901)
*Denniz Goren,Holger Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了针对自行车的3D LiDAR分割方法，创建了BikeScenes-lidarseg数据集，通过领域特定训练显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动自行车日益普及，骑行者面临的安全风险增加，需要将汽车感知技术适配到自行车安全领域。

Method: 使用多传感器'SenseBike'研究平台，开发3D LiDAR分割方法，创建包含3021个连续LiDAR扫描的BikeScenes数据集，涵盖29个动态和静态类别。

Result: 在BikeScenes数据集上微调后达到63.6%的平均交并比(mIoU)，显著优于仅使用SemanticKITTI预训练的13.8%。

Conclusion: 领域特定训练对于自行车感知系统至关重要，BikeScenes数据集为以骑行者为中心的LiDAR分割研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的STM图像修复和超分辨率方法，通过物理信息合成数据生成训练模型，能够有效修复图像并实现2-4倍的图像采集时间减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决STM技术中针尖退化和缓慢串行数据采集的限制，减少针尖调节频率并提高现有高速STM系统的帧率。

Method: 使用仅36张原始实验图像，通过物理信息合成数据生成管道训练最先进的流匹配和扩散模型。

Result: 模型能够有效修复图像，通过稀疏采样数据准确重建图像，实现图像采集时间2-4倍的减少。

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力显著提高STM实验吞吐量，减少针尖调节频率并增强现有高速STM系统的帧率。

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于流分解与聚合的框架，解决整流流模型在图像编辑中的反转不准确和梯度纠缠问题，通过语义分解提示词、独立计算子流并自适应聚合，提升编辑质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整流流模型在图像生成中表现出色，但在图像编辑任务中存在反转过程不准确和梯度纠缠问题，导致编辑结果无法忠实反映目标提示。现有方法编辑质量仍不理想。

Method: 采用反转自由公式，将目标提示语义分解为多个子提示，为每个子提示计算独立流，然后通过投影和软聚合机制自适应加权子目标速度场，抑制语义冗余并强调不同方向。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在语义保真度和属性解缠方面优于现有的零样本编辑方法。

Conclusion: 提出的流分解与聚合框架有效解决了整流流模型在图像编辑中的关键限制，实现了更好的编辑质量和语义一致性。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/SplitFlow.

### [11] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Brain-IT是一种基于大脑启发的fMRI图像重建方法，通过功能聚类和Transformer架构，使用有限数据实现高质量图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前基于fMRI的图像重建方法缺乏对真实所见图像忠实度的问题，特别是在数据有限的情况下。

Method: 使用Brain Interaction Transformer(BIT)实现功能相似脑体素簇之间的有效交互，预测高层次语义特征和低层次结构特征来指导扩散模型。

Result: 在视觉和客观指标上超越当前最先进方法，仅用1小时fMRI数据就能达到与40小时数据训练方法相当的效果。

Conclusion: Brain-IT通过大脑启发的功能聚类和直接信息流设计，实现了更忠实、更高效的fMRI图像重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于SAM 2.1基础模型的实时肿瘤跟踪方法，在TrackRAD2025挑战赛中取得第六名，Dice得分为0.8794。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在强数据稀缺约束下，对胸腹部cine-MRI序列进行实时肿瘤跟踪的挑战。

Method: 使用SAM 2.1 b+模型，基于第一张标注切片的掩码提示进行微调，采用平衡Dice+IoU损失函数，低学习率训练300个epoch。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上达到0.8794的Dice分数，在TrackRAD2025挑战赛中排名第六。

Conclusion: 基础模型在MRI引导放疗中具有实现准确实时肿瘤跟踪的强大潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

Method: 采用Hilbert选择性扫描机制，通过增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度来改进特征空间探索，提高空间局部性并减少信息不一致性。

Result: 在公开基准测试中显著提升了现有基于Mamba的低光图像增强方法的定量指标和定性视觉保真度，同时减少了计算资源消耗和推理时间。

Conclusion: 该策略不仅推进了低光图像增强的最新技术，还为更广泛的应用基于Mamba技术的领域带来了前景。

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAVE是首个真实世界视觉异常基准，支持异常描述、解释和证明三个开放任务，为评估视觉语言模型在异常检测和理解方面提供认知科学启发的综合框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机视觉中的异常检测主要局限于工业缺陷或合成异常，无法捕捉真实世界异常的丰富性和不可预测性，而人类却能自然地识别、推理和解释环境中的异常。

Method: 构建CAVE基准数据集，包含细粒度标注，涵盖视觉定位、异常分类（基于视觉表现、复杂性、严重性和常见性），这些标注受到认知科学研究启发。

Result: 实验表明，即使采用先进的提示策略，最先进的视觉语言模型在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面仍存在困难。

Conclusion: CAVE作为一个现实且认知基础扎实的基准，为推进异常检测和视觉语言模型中的常识推理研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级CNN模型，用于预测不同海平面上升情景下的沿海洪水淹没深度，在阿布扎比和旧金山两个不同地理区域验证了模型的泛化能力，相比现有方法平均减少近20%的预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理模拟器计算成本高昂，难以应用于城市尺度的沿海规划；深度学习技术面临数据稀缺和高维输出等挑战，需要开发更高效的洪水预测方法。

Method: 采用基于视觉的低资源深度学习框架，开发轻量级卷积神经网络模型，预测不同海平面上升和海岸线适应情景下的沿海洪水。

Result: 模型在两个不同地理区域（阿布扎比和旧金山）的数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力，预测洪水深度图的平均绝对误差比现有最优方法平均降低近20%。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为沿海洪水管理的可扩展实用工具，帮助决策者制定有效的缓解策略应对气候变化影响。

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在理解视频复杂时序动态方面存在严重局限，难以理解动作序列和时序进展

Method: 在视觉编码器中直接引入堆叠时间注意力模块，通过时间注意力机制更好地捕捉动作进展和帧间关系

Result: 在VITATECS、MVBench和Video-MME等基准测试中性能提升高达+5.5%，显著改善了时序推理能力

Conclusion: 通过增强视觉编码器的时序结构，解决了Video-LLMs在视频理解中的关键差距

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决儿科肘部和腕部骨折超声图像分割中专家标注耗时且成本高的问题，帮助训练不足的用户更自信地进行检查。

Method: 采用上下文学习(ICL)框架，在视频内分割设置中，专家仅标注少量帧，模型分割未见过的帧。系统研究图像拼接技术和训练策略，引入新颖的拼接方法。

Result: 在四个腕部和肘部超声数据集上，使用仅5%的训练图像，Dice系数比最先进模型提升1-27%，在1,252个超声扫描中表现优异。

Conclusion: FlexICL是超声图像分割的高效可扩展解决方案，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的医学成像场景。

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负提示方法使用固定的负提示，无法根据生成过程中的图像内容进行自适应调整，限制了负引导的效果和灵活性。

Method: 在特定去噪步骤生成中间图像预测，然后查询视觉语言模型来生成上下文相关的负提示，实现动态负提示生成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的评估表明，该方法能够有效平衡负引导强度与文本图像对齐之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 动态负提示方法通过视觉语言模型的自适应能力，显著提升了扩散模型中负提示的效果和灵活性。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PReMA攻击方法，通过修改输入图像而非提示词来操纵多模态扩散模型的输出内容，特别针对图像编辑应用中固定提示词的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型中文本和图像模态的对齐不足，存在生成不当或NSFW内容的风险，需要探索仅通过对抗图像来操纵模型输出的攻击方法。

Method: 提出Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA)，通过修改输入图像配合任何指定提示词来操纵生成内容，而不改变提示词本身。

Result: 在图像修复和风格迁移任务上的综合评估证实了PReMA的有效性，能够成功操纵模型输出。

Conclusion: PReMA对多模态扩散模型的完整性构成了新的威胁，特别是在使用固定提示词的图像编辑应用中。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Motivation: 研究视频LLM在不同视角视频中是否能够保持时间理解的一致性，现有模型在多视角场景下表现不佳。

Method: 引入EgoExo-Con基准，包含同步的自我视角和外部视角视频对，提出View-GRPO强化学习框架来增强视角特定的时间推理和跨视角一致性。

Result: 现有视频LLM在多视角一致性方面表现较差，View-GRPO方法相比传统SFT和GRPO在提升跨视角一致性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 跨视角时间理解一致性是视频LLM的重要挑战，View-GRPO框架能有效提升模型在多视角视频中的一致性表现。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文研究面临两大挑战：复杂的多任务解释流程，以及信息组织和检索效率低下。学者需要花费大量时间搜索、整理和管理相关资源。

Method: 构建包含140万单字拓片图像和8万条释文的领域专用多模态知识库，开发基于LLM的OracleAgent系统，灵活编排多个甲骨文分析工具。

Conclusion: OracleAgent为实现甲骨文辅助研究和自动化解释系统的实际部署迈出了重要一步，有效提升了研究效率。

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

TL;DR: 提出联合优化3D高斯点和相机位姿的统一框架，无需预校准输入，通过交替优化策略同时提升场景重建保真度和位姿精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法依赖外部相机位姿估计工具如COLMAP，存在计算瓶颈和误差传播问题

Method: 将联合优化解耦为两个交替阶段：固定位姿下通过可微分渲染更新3D高斯参数，使用定制3D光流算法结合几何和光度约束优化相机位姿

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在重建质量上显著优于现有无COLMAP技术，并且总体上超越了基于COLMAP的基准方法

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架能够有效处理具有大视角变化和稀疏特征分布的挑战性场景，逐步减少投影误差

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Conclusion: 该工作旨在推动可泛化、鲁棒且安全的端到端自动驾驶智能体研究，使其能够处理复杂的现实世界情况。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然使用网络梯度识别注意力区域，但将这些梯度注意力信息直接集成到CNN表示中以进行语义对象理解的应用仍然有限。这种集成对于SLAM等视觉任务特别有益，因为增强空间注意力对象位置的CNN表示可以提升性能。

Method: 利用任务特定的网络注意力，将基于网络梯度的分层注意力信息与CNN特征表示相集成，以改进帧关联性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线方法相比性能有所提升，特别是在大型环境中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 将梯度注意力信息集成到CNN表示中能够有效提升RGB-D室内SLAM的性能，特别是在大规模环境中的帧关联任务。

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

Motivation: 现有的3D部件生成方法存在两个问题：隐式向量集表示缺乏几何细节，而显式体素表示共享全局网格导致小部件分辨率不足。需要结合两种方法的优势来生成高质量的详细部件。

Method: 1. 使用隐式向量集扩散过程生成边界框布局；2. 每个部件在各自的全分辨率体素网格中生成；3. 引入中心点编码策略解决不同尺寸部件间的信息交换对齐问题。

Conclusion: FullPart通过结合隐式和显式表示的优势，解决了3D部件生成中的细节不足问题，同时发布的PartVerse-XL数据集（40K对象、320K部件）将推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Motivation: 任意尺度视频超分辨率面临空间细节重建、时间一致性和计算复杂度的挑战，需要一种能够适应不同缩放因子和应用场景的通用解决方案。

Method: 整合四个关键组件：1)基于图像拉普拉斯金字塔的自适应多尺度频率先验；2)流引导传播单元聚合时空信息；3)二阶运动补偿单元实现更准确的空间对齐；4)超上采样单元生成尺度感知且内容无关的上采样核。提供三种传播变体适应不同场景。

Conclusion: BasicAVSR不仅推进了任意尺度视频超分辨率的技术水平，还将其核心组件扩展到多个框架以适应多样化场景，为实际应用提供了强大基础。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAG-MM是一个全面的多模态多轮对话RAG基准测试，包含6.5K个(图像、问题、答案)三元组和2K个基于视觉的多轮对话，涵盖13个领域，专门针对可穿戴设备场景设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏针对可穿戴设备场景的多模态检索增强生成(MM-RAG)的全面基准测试，特别是支持多轮对话的基准。

Method: 构建包含多样化图像(包括6.2K个第一人称视角图像)、问题类型和对话轮次的基准数据集，设计三个任务：单源增强、多源增强和多轮对话，并提供检索语料库和API。

Result: 直接RAG方法在单轮和多轮QA上的真实性分别仅为32%和43%，而业界最先进解决方案质量相似(32%/45%)，表明有巨大改进空间。该基准已举办KDD Cup 2025，获胜方案将基线性能提升了28%。

Conclusion: CRAG-MM填补了多模态RAG基准测试的空白，特别是在可穿戴设备场景下，为未来研究提供了重要基准，并已显示出对领域发展的积极影响。

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于扩散模型的高分辨率运动轨迹估计框架MoTDiff，能够从单张运动模糊图像中恢复高质量的运动轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有从单张模糊图像提取运动信息的方法（如模糊核和光流）通常质量较低，表现为粗粒度和不准确。需要开发能够估计高质量高分辨率运动轨迹的新方法。

Method: MoTDiff包含两个关键组件：1）使用从单张模糊图像提取的多尺度特征图作为条件的条件扩散框架；2）新的训练方法，促进精确识别细粒度运动轨迹、一致估计运动路径整体形状和位置、以及沿运动轨迹的像素连通性。

Result: 实验表明，MoTDiff在盲图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MoTDiff框架能够有效从单张运动模糊图像中估计高质量的高分辨率运动轨迹，在多个应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

TL;DR: ConceptScope是一个可扩展的自动化框架，使用稀疏自编码器和视觉基础模型来发现和量化视觉数据集中的可解释概念，用于数据集偏差识别和模型诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习数据集中普遍存在数据集偏差，但系统识别这些偏差需要昂贵的人工标注。需要一种无需精细标注就能自动发现和量化偏差的方法。

Method: 使用在视觉基础模型表示上训练的稀疏自编码器来发现人类可解释的概念，根据语义相关性和统计相关性将概念分类为目标、上下文和偏差类型。

Result: ConceptScope能够捕获广泛的视觉概念，包括物体、纹理、背景、面部属性等，并能可靠检测已知偏差和发现未标注的新偏差。

Conclusion: ConceptScope为数据集审计和模型诊断提供了一个实用的工具，能够自动识别数据集偏差并支持鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

Conclusion: 提出的'从合成中学习'策略和端到端框架有效解决了草图到3D姿态估计的挑战，实现了高精度和快速的人体姿态估计。

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法相比现有最先进方法具有平均改进和效率提升，结果证实了该方法在供应链风险管理和可持续性分析中的有效性。

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型，解决了文档布局生成领域数据稀缺和现有方法在复杂布局中表现不佳的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 当前文档AI研究主要集中在文档布局分析，而文档布局生成研究不足。主要障碍在于缺乏多样化的布局数据，现有研究主要关注学术论文的曼哈顿式结构，而报纸、杂志等开放世界文档类型代表性不足。

Method: 1) 构建了首个百万级多样化文档布局数据集OmniLayout-1M，涵盖六种常见文档类型；2) 提出了OmniLayout-LLM模型，采用两阶段粗到细学习范式：首先从OmniLayout-1M学习通用布局原则，然后通过细粒度注释将知识迁移到特定领域。

Result: 在M$^{6}$Doc数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多个领域都取得了强劲性能，显著超越了现有的布局生成专家方法和几个最新的通用大语言模型。

Conclusion: OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型有效解决了文档布局生成领域的数据稀缺和复杂布局处理问题，为文档生成研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但对视频中时间信息的理解能力较弱且缺乏充分评估。本文旨在探究模型在时间方向判断这一基础能力上的表现。

Method: 引入AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准，使用与人类行为基线相同的刺激材料，全面评估开源和专有、推理和非推理型视觉语言模型在时间方向判断任务上的表现。

Result: 大多数模型在物理不可逆过程（如自由落体、扩散/爆炸）和因果手动动作（除法/加法）上的表现接近随机水平，即使最佳模型也远低于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统虽然能捕捉丰富的视觉语义关联，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解的归纳偏差，存在根本性能力差距。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Conclusion: 基于人类认知启发的生成式图像融合方法在增强结构一致性和细节质量方面具有优势。

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Result: ResNet50单独表现最佳，但三种网络融合显著提升性能，热图显示不同网络关注图像的不同区域，体现了互补性。该方法在UBIPr数据库上显著优于先前工作。

Conclusion: 不同CNN架构在虹膜验证中具有互补性，网络融合策略能有效提升性能，为远距离生物识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: CATG框架通过约束流匹配有效解决了自动驾驶规划中的模式崩溃问题，并能直接生成符合安全和物理约束的多样化轨迹。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

*Luting Wang,Yinghao Xiang,Hongliang Huang,Dongjun Li,Chen Gao,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AEOS-Bench基准套件和AEOS-Former调度模型，用于解决敏捷地球观测卫星星座在大规模、动态环境下的调度挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往简化了卫星调度的复杂性，限制了实际性能，需要更真实的基准和调度模型。

Method: 开发了包含3,907个卫星资源和16,410个场景的AEOS-Bench基准套件，并提出了基于Transformer的AEOS-Former调度模型，集成约束感知注意力机制和内部约束模块。

Result: AEOS-Former在任务完成率和能源效率方面优于基线模型，消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Conclusion: AEOS-Bench是首个面向真实星座调度的大规模基准套件，AEOS-Former为AEOS星座调度提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于证据理论的新型融合范式，有效整合CNN和ViT骨干网络的特征，提升糖尿病视网膜病变分级的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是导致中老年人视力丧失的主要原因，现有基于单一CNN或ViT骨干网络的方法性能已达瓶颈，需要整合不同骨干网络的优势来进一步提升性能。

Method: 通过一组深度证据网络将不同骨干网络提取的特征转换为支持证据，形成聚合意见，自适应调整不同骨干网络间的融合模式。

Result: 在两个公开的DR分级数据集上的实验结果表明，该混合模型不仅提高了DR分级的准确性，还提供了特征融合和决策的优异可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的证据融合范式有效整合了CNN的局部特征提取能力和ViT的全局特征捕获能力，显著提升了DR诊断系统的性能。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

### [43] [GLYPH-SR: Can We Achieve Both High-Quality Image Super-Resolution and High-Fidelity Text Recovery via VLM-guided Latent Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26339)
*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR是一个视觉语言引导的扩散框架，专门针对场景文本超分辨率，同时优化文本可读性和感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率方法主要关注失真度或感知质量指标，但对字符级错误不敏感，导致场景文本（如标志、标签等）在OCR识别中失败。现有研究往往简化文本场景，忽略了复杂自然场景中的文本恢复挑战。

Method: 使用文本-SR融合控制网络（TS-ControlNet）结合OCR数据引导，采用乒乓调度器在文本和场景中心引导之间交替。在合成语料库上训练这些组件，同时保持主要SR分支冻结。

Result: 在SVT、SCUT-CTW1500和CUTE80数据集上，4倍和8倍超分辨率时，GLYPH-SR比扩散/GAN基线在OCR F1分数上提高了高达15.18个百分点，同时保持竞争力的MANIQA、CLIP-IQA和MUSIQ分数。

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR能够同时实现高可读性和高视觉真实感，提供既看起来正确又能正确阅读的超分辨率结果。

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合EEG嵌入和空间显著图的双条件框架，通过ATM提取EEG特征，使用LoRA微调Stable Diffusion 2.1，并利用ControlNet分支进行空间控制，显著提升了EEG驱动图像重建的质量和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG驱动图像重建方法往往忽视空间注意力机制，导致重建图像的保真度和语义连贯性受限。

Method: 使用自适应思维映射器(ATM)提取EEG特征，通过低秩适应(LoRA)微调Stable Diffusion 2.1，结合ControlNet分支利用显著图进行空间控制。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG数据集上评估，该方法在低层和高层图像特征质量上显著优于现有方法，同时与人类视觉注意力高度一致。

Conclusion: 注意力先验能够解决EEG信号的模糊性，实现高保真重建，在医学诊断和神经自适应接口中有应用前景，通过高效适应预训练扩散模型推进了神经解码技术。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成评估主要关注短片段和简化提示，缺乏对长视频生成中复杂提示处理、细粒度对齐和抽象维度（如叙事连贯性）的评估。

Method: 基于真实视频构建复杂提示，建立多维度评估框架，包括事件级对齐、细粒度时间一致性、内容清晰度和HERD指标，并对9个代表性长视频生成模型进行全面评估。

Result: 当前方法在基本视觉和时间方面表现良好，但在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题一致性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为长视频生成提供了全面可靠的评估平台，并指出了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了A-TPT框架，通过引入角度多样性来改善视觉语言模型在测试时提示调优中的校准性能，通过最大化单位超球面上特征间的最小成对角度距离来实现均匀分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时提示调优方法缺乏文本特征间的分散性，影响模型校准性能，从而影响视觉语言模型的可靠性、可信度和安全性。现有方法主要关注最大化平均文本特征分散性或施加正交约束，但可能无法获得最优的角度分离。

Method: 提出A-TPT框架，引入角度多样性概念，通过最大化单位超球面上归一化文本特征之间的最小成对角度距离，鼓励学习提示诱导的文本特征分布均匀性。

Result: 在各种骨干网络和数据集上的广泛实验表明，A-TPT在降低聚合平均校准误差方面持续优于最先进的TPT方法，同时保持相当的准确率。在自然分布偏移上表现出优越的零样本校准性能，并能很好地泛化到医学数据集。

Conclusion: 促进角度多样性是实现良好分散文本特征的有效方法，能显著改善视觉语言模型在测试时适应过程中的校准性能。

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 该论文将基础3D重建模型（DUSt3R和MASt3R）适配用于点跟踪任务，通过3D基础对应关系，在静态和动态点跟踪方面取得了竞争性或更优的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用先进的3D重建模型在静态场景中的2D和3D对应能力，将其扩展到点跟踪任务，特别是处理动态点对应关系。

Method: 将重建损失与动态对应训练相结合，添加可见性头，使用少量合成数据对MASt3R进行微调，仅在包含查询点的帧对上进行训练和评估。

Result: 在四个数据集上取得竞争性或更优的点跟踪结果，在TAP-Vid-DAVIS上达到73.8 δ_avg/85.8%遮挡准确率，在EgoPoints和RGB-S上显著优于CoTracker3。

Conclusion: 通过3D基础对应关系和适当的训练策略，基础3D重建模型可以有效地适应点跟踪任务，在静态和动态点跟踪方面表现优异。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

TL;DR: 本文提出FineGrainedAD框架，通过多级细粒度语义描述解决少样本异常检测中的语义对齐问题，提升异常定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本异常检测方法依赖预训练视觉语言模型，但由于缺乏详细文本描述，只能使用预定义的图像级描述来匹配视觉补丁，导致图像描述与补丁级视觉异常之间的语义不对齐，定位性能不佳。

Method: 提出多级细粒度语义描述(MFSC)为异常检测数据集提供多级细粒度文本描述，并构建FineGrainedAD框架，包含多级可学习提示(MLLP)和多级语义对齐(MLSA)两个组件。MLLP通过自动替换和连接机制将细粒度语义引入多级可学习提示，MLSA设计区域聚合策略和多级对齐训练来促进可学习提示与对应视觉区域的对齐。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上的实验表明，FineGrainedAD在少样本设置下实现了优越的整体性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入多级细粒度语义描述和对齐机制，FineGrainedAD有效解决了少样本异常检测中的语义对齐问题，显著提升了异常定位性能。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中对象-上下文关联偏差问题，这种偏差会降低模型在测试场景与训练共现模式不同时的可靠性

Method: 在CLIP表示空间中估计对象和背景期望，通过将对象特征与来自外部数据集、批次邻居或文本描述的不同上下文重新组合来合成反事实嵌入，使用总直接效应估计和干预模拟来减去仅背景激活

Result: 无需重新训练或提示设计，在上下文敏感基准测试中显著提高了最差组和平均准确率，建立了新的零样本最先进水平

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种轻量级的表示级反事实方法，为去偏和可靠的多模态推理提供了一条实用的因果途径

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 现有自改进方法在视觉语言模型中存在不平衡优化问题，模型擅长处理简单查询但难以应对复杂推理任务，导致马太效应并阻碍进一步改进。

Conclusion: 通过头尾重新平衡策略可以有效缓解自改进过程中的马太效应，显著提升模型的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil
engineering datasets (<10K images) while preserving computational efficiency,
providing practical solutions for construction safety monitoring and
infrastructure inspection in data-constrained environments.

Method: 1）尺度自适应互补策略学习跨维度长距离相关特征；2）结构亲和变换将语义特征与类特定亲和力结合，配合Transformer解码器进行结构感知推理；3）特征混合损失聚合方法增强模型训练。

Result: 实验结果表明SA²Net相比其他最先进方法获得更优的分割性能，且对不同骨干网络具有良好的适应性。

Conclusion: SA²Net作为智能脊柱图像分析的先进工具，在脊柱侧弯诊断中具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

*Wen Xie,Yanjun Zhu,Gijs Overgoor,Yakov Bart,Agata Lapedriza Garcia,Sarah Ostadabbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动化视频广告剪辑框架，将视频剪辑定义为针对广告的镜头选择问题，强调音频在广告中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要手动从长视频广告中选择和重新编辑镜头来创建短版本，这既费时又费力。

Method: 开发了一个双流音视频融合模型，预测视频帧的重要性，其中重要性定义为帧在厂商制作的短广告中被选中的可能性。

Result: 在AdSum204数据集上的实验表明，该模型在平均精度、曲线下面积、Spearman和Kendall等指标上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将视频剪辑作为镜头选择问题，并强调音频的重要性，为自动化视频广告剪辑提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出动态上下文感知场景推理框架，利用视觉-语言对齐处理零样本真实世界场景，无需任务特定训练即可适应新环境


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中AI系统常面临无标签数据的陌生场景，传统场景理解模型难以泛化到未见过的上下文，限制了视觉应用在动态非结构化环境中的部署

Method: 集成预训练视觉变换器和大型语言模型，将视觉语义与自然语言描述对齐，通过动态推理模块结合全局场景线索和对象级交互，由语言先验指导

Result: 在COCO、Visual Genome和Open Images等零样本基准测试中，场景理解准确率比基线模型提升高达18%，在模糊或杂乱场景中表现稳健

Conclusion: 该框架为上下文感知推理提供了可扩展且可解释的方法，推进了动态真实世界设置中的零样本泛化能力

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATCH是一个即插即用的跨域自适应框架，通过解耦视觉和语言适应，使用轻量级域分类器和双适配器机制，在不重新训练主干模型的情况下提升VQA模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VQA模型在自然图像领域表现优异，但在遥感、医疗影像、数学图表等域外场景中泛化能力显著下降，需要昂贵的逐域微调或定制化流程。

Method: 引入域分类器识别输入图像类型，以及包含提示适配器和视觉适配器的双适配器机制，通过统一钩子接口动态注入，无需重新训练主干模型。

Result: 在四个域特定VQA基准测试中取得一致性能提升：MathVQA上BLEU+2.3，MedVQA-RAD上VQA+2.6，ChartQA上ROUGE+3.1。

Conclusion: CATCH为多域VQA提供了可扩展和可扩展的方法，能够在不同应用领域实现实际部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

Conclusion: Emu3.5是一个功能强大的多模态世界模型，具有可泛化的世界建模能力，支持时空一致的世界探索和开放世界具身操作，已开源供社区研究使用。

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at

TL;DR: ResMatching是一种新的计算超分辨率方法，使用引导条件流匹配学习改进的数据先验，在生物结构图像上实现数据保真度和感知真实性的最佳平衡，并能提供像素级不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算超分辨率是一个不适定问题，核心在于找到能够外推显微镜图像中未成像频率的先验。随着数据驱动机器学习技术的发展，可以学习更强的先验来获得更好的超分辨率结果。

Method: 提出ResMatching方法，使用引导条件流匹配来学习改进的数据先验，能够从隐式学习的后验分布中采样，并提供像素级数据不确定性估计。

Result: 在BioSR数据集的4种不同生物结构上评估，与7个基线方法比较，ResMatching始终获得有竞争力的结果，在所有情况下都展现出数据保真度和感知真实性的最佳平衡。在低分辨率图像噪声较多、强先验难以学习的情况下特别有效。

Conclusion: ResMatching在计算超分辨率中表现出色，特别是在噪声较多的情况下，能够提供校准的后验分布和像素级不确定性估计，指导用户拒绝不确定的预测。

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对事件相机的令牌化方法Spiking Patches，能够保持事件的异步性和空间稀疏性，同时实现比体素和帧表示更快的推理速度，在准确率上相当甚至更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件表示方法（帧或体素）虽然准确率高，但破坏了事件相机的异步性和空间稀疏性特性，需要找到既能保持这些特性又不牺牲准确率的表示方法。

Method: 提出Spiking Patches令牌化器，将异步稀疏的事件流转换为令牌表示，使用GNN、PCN和Transformer在姿态识别和物体检测任务上进行评估。

Result: Spiking Patches令牌的推理速度比体素令牌快3.4倍，比帧表示快10.4倍，在准确率上相当甚至更好，姿态识别绝对提升达3.8%，物体检测达1.4%。

Conclusion: 令牌化为事件视觉提供了新方向，是向保持事件相机特性方法迈进的重要一步。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

model's ability to capture small-object details and contextual information.
Furthermore,we incorporate Focaler-SIoU to strengthen the model's bounding box

thereby further enhancing detection accuracy and robustness. Compared with

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

TL;DR: 首次大规模评估48种深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像上的性能，多个模型达到亚公里级精度（300-400米），证明深度学习光流方法可有效应用于极地遥感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计海冰漂移对北极航行、气候研究和业务预报至关重要。传统光流方法依赖数学模型和强运动假设，在复杂场景中精度有限，而深度学习光流方法在计算机视觉中表现出色，但其在地球物理问题和卫星SAR图像中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用48种深度学习光流模型处理RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像，通过端点误差(EPE)和Fl指标与GNSS跟踪浮标进行对比评估。

Result: 多个模型达到亚公里级精度（EPE 6-8像素，300-400米），相对于海冰运动的空间尺度和北极典型导航需求来说误差较小。模型能够捕捉一致的区域漂移模式。

Conclusion: 深度学习光流方法相比传统方法显著提高了运动估计精度，可有效迁移到极地遥感中。光流产生空间连续的漂移场，为每个图像像素提供运动估计，为导航和气候建模提供了新机遇。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

Abstract: We present a long-term deployment study of a machine vision-based anomaly
detection system for failure prediction in a steel rolling mill. The system
integrates industrial cameras to monitor equipment operation, alignment, and
hot bar motion in real time along the process line. Live video streams are
processed on a centralized video server using deep learning models, enabling
early prediction of equipment failures and process interruptions, thereby
reducing unplanned breakdown costs. Server-based inference minimizes the
computational load on industrial process control systems (PLCs), supporting
scalable deployment across production lines with minimal additional resources.
By jointly analyzing sensor data from data acquisition systems and visual
inputs, the system identifies the location and probable root causes of
failures, providing actionable insights for proactive maintenance. This
integrated approach enhances operational reliability, productivity, and
profitability in industrial manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly transformed
the landscape of 3D scene representations, inspiring an extensive body of
associated research. Follow-up work includes analyses and contributions that
enhance the efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability of 3DGS. In

training and rendering, the evolution toward dynamic (or four-dimensional,
4DGS) representations, and deeper exploration of the mathematical foundations
underlying its appearance modeling and rendering process. Furthermore, we
examine efforts to bring 3DGS to mobile and virtual reality platforms, its
extension to massive-scale environments, and recent progress toward
near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed
computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved
from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for
3D vision and graphics.

*Anushka Sivakumar,Andrew Zhang,Zaber Hakim,Chris Thomas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteerVLM是一个轻量级转向模块，通过动态调整语言模态与图像上下文之间的激活连接，实现对视觉语言模型输出的细粒度控制，无需修改模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在遵循特定指令方面存在不足，需要一种轻量级方法来引导模型输出更好地符合期望行为，同时保持非目标任务的性能。

Method: 从编码目标行为和相反行为的配对提示的潜在嵌入中学习，通过维度激活调制和跨层自适应转向来动态调整激活连接，仅需学习原始VLM参数0.14%的参数。

Result: 在转向和幻觉缓解基准测试中优于现有干预技术，提出了通过激活工程实现多模态模型控制的稳健解决方案。

Conclusion: SteerVLM提供了一种有效的推理时控制方法，能够在不修改模型权重的情况下实现对复杂输出语义的细粒度控制，同时引入了VNIA数据集来支持VLM转向技术的发展。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

TL;DR: 该论文对视频生成模型作为零样本推理器的能力进行实证研究，发现当前模型在短时空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部动态一致性方面表现良好，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频生成模型是否能够作为零样本推理器在具有挑战性的视觉推理场景中发挥作用，特别是评估它们在空间、几何、物理、时间和具身逻辑等多个维度的推理能力。

Method: 使用领先的Veo-3模型，在12个推理维度上进行全面评估，并构建MME-CoF基准来系统化评估链式帧推理能力。

Result: 研究发现视频模型在短时空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部动态一致性方面显示出有前景的推理模式，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面存在明显限制。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型还不能作为独立的零样本推理器，但可以作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎，显示出令人鼓舞的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of
irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research
focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM
challenge - the most comprehensive AMD detection from RGB fundus images
research competition and open dataset to date - serve as a benchmark for our
evaluation. Taking the U-Net connectivity as a base of our framework, we
evaluate and compare several approaches to improve the segmentation model's
architecture and training pipeline, including pre-processing techniques,
encoder (backbone) deep network types of varying complexity, and specialized
loss functions to mitigate class imbalances on image and pixel levels. The main
outcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection
framework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the
multi-class segmentation of different AMD lesion types in non-invasive RGB
fundus images. The source code used to conduct the experiments presented in

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的分层运动建模方法，通过图神经网络学习数据驱动的运动层次结构，将全局运动分解为父级继承模式和局部运动残差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动定义或启发式的固定运动基元层次结构，限制了在不同任务间的泛化能力。需要一种能从数据中直接学习结构化、可解释运动关系的通用方法。

Method: 将层次推理建模为可微图学习问题，顶点表示基本运动，有向边通过图神经网络捕获学习的父子依赖关系，使用基于图的层次结构分解全局绝对运动。

Result: 在1D平动、2D转动和3D高斯溅射场景变形三个任务上验证，成功重建了内在运动层次结构，在动态3D高斯溅射场景中相比基线产生更真实和可解释的变形效果。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个适用于广泛运动中心任务的适应性、数据驱动的分层建模范式，能够从数据中学习结构化运动关系。

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Conclusion: 通过系统地从视频生成向运动生成转移知识，成功突破了3D人体运动生成的泛化瓶颈，为跨模态生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 解决全球尺度图像地理定位的挑战：传统图像检索方法在大规模数据下效率低下，全局分类结果粗糙，跨视角检索存在领域差距且主要限于小区域研究。

Method: 使用代理分类任务学习丰富的特征表示，结合航空影像嵌入增强对稀疏地面数据的鲁棒性，实现跨多国区域的直接细粒度检索。

Result: 在覆盖欧洲大部分地区的数据集上，超过68%的查询能在200米范围内精确定位。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在大地理范围内的高精度地理定位，为大规模图像定位问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有视频转4D方法依赖手动标注的相机姿态，成本高且对野外视频不鲁棒。warp-then-inpaint方法虽然无需姿态标签，但将相机运动与场景动态耦合，使建模和推理复杂化。

Method: 提出轨迹到相机框架，用固定虚拟相机库替代显式轨迹预测，将相机控制与场景建模分离。训练视图条件视频修复模型学习几何先验，通过去噪合成扭曲图像和修复遮挡区域。基于此设计时空自回归推理流水线。

Conclusion: SEE4D实现了从随意视频进行实用4D世界建模的进展，具有更好的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

Motivation: 传统的自回归字幕方法中视觉学习信号的强度依赖于标记在序列中的位置，需要辅助目标。MDC旨在减少这种依赖性，提供更均匀的视觉学习信号。

Method: 在训练过程中，随机掩码图像-字幕对中的文本标记，然后使用基于视觉特征的解码器重构原始文本。通过图像条件掩码扩散语言模型学习视觉特征。

Result: 线性探测实验表明，MDC学习的视觉特征在多种学术规模模型和数据集上与自回归和对比方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MDC提供了一种有效的视觉特征学习方法，减少了位置依赖性，无需辅助目标，在多个下游视觉任务中表现良好。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

Conclusion: OmniX通过重用2D生成先验，实现了多功能统一的全景视觉任务处理，推动了图形就绪3D场景生成技术的发展。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

### [80] [Humains-Junior: A 3.8B Language Model Achieving GPT-4o-Level Factual Accuracy by Directed Exoskeleton Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25933)
*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 3.8B参数的Humans-Junior模型在FACTS Grounding基准测试中与GPT-4o表现相当（在±5%的等效范围内），同时云服务成本降低约19倍，自托管部署可实现接近零的边际成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发成本效益高的小型语言模型，使其在事实基础任务上达到前沿模型性能，同时大幅降低推理成本。

Method: 结合最小化定向"外骨骼推理"支架和行为微调，教导协议遵循而非领域知识。两者结合产生协同效应，提升性能17.7个百分点并减少25%的方差。

Result: 在Q1-Q500测试中，Humans-Junior得分72.7%，GPT-4o得分73.5%，差异仅0.8个百分点，在±5%范围内等效。在提示设置下，定向推理使GPT-4o提升11.8个百分点至85.3%，Gemini-2.5-Pro提升5.0个百分点至93.3%。

Conclusion: 通过定向推理和行为微调的组合方法，小型模型可以在事实基础任务上达到前沿模型性能，同时实现显著的成本优势。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

*Xingjian Zhang,Tianhong Gao,Suliang Jin,Tianhao Wang,Teng Ye,Eytan Adar,Qiaozhu Mei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种人机协作框架，通过拒绝采样方法从仅标签标注中推断思维轨迹，用于改进LLM评估器的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估器在主观任务中可靠性有限，因为人类判断涉及超出标注标签的微妙推理，而思维轨迹难以收集和整理

Method: 使用拒绝采样方法重构思维轨迹，并将其应用于：(1)微调开源LLM评估器；(2)为专有LLM评估器合成更清晰的标注指南

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提高了LLM与人类的一致性，改进的标注指南还增加了不同LLM模型间的一致性

Conclusion: LLM可以作为人类思维轨迹的实用代理，使仅标签语料库扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，从而提高LLM评估器的可靠性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两层次框架来解释为什么压缩过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。信息论必要性(ITI)建立了生存压力与信息处理需求之间的联系，压缩效率原则(CEP)说明高效压缩如何通过异常积累动态机制性地选择生成性因果模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架虽然认识到压缩对智能的核心作用，但未能具体说明为什么这个过程会强制发现因果结构而非表面统计模式。

Method: 引入两层次框架：ITI从进化角度解释生存压力如何导致信息处理需求，CEP从机制角度说明高效压缩如何通过异常积累动态选择因果模型。

Result: 该框架产生可实证检验的预测：压缩效率与分布外泛化相关，异常积累率区分因果与相关模型，分层系统在不同抽象层显示效率提升，生物系统代谢成本跟踪表征复杂性。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP为生物、人工和多尺度系统的智能收敛提供了统一解释，无需诉诸意识或主观经验的假设，说明智能是结构化环境中持续存在的机械必然结果。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对齐基于LLM的评委与人类偏好是一个重大挑战，因为它们难以校准且经常存在评分标准敏感性、偏见和不稳定性。克服这一挑战可以推进关键应用，如为RLHF创建可靠的奖励模型和构建有效的路由系统。

Method: 提出了一个基于角色的偏好建模框架，学习聚合多个基于评分标准的评委输出。包括基于角色的方法大规模合成偏好标签，以及两种聚合器实现：广义加性模型(GAM)和多层感知器(MLP)。

Result: 评估了该方法与简单基线的性能表现，并通过案例研究评估了其对人类和LLM评委偏见的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效建模多样化的基于角色的偏好，为校准LLM评委提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Motivation: LLM在科学研究中展现出巨大潜力，但在高风险场景下的可信度问题亟待解决，需要系统评估框架来确保AI系统的可靠部署。

Method: 开发了包含新颖开放式真实性基准和科学伦理基准的综合评估框架，采用反射调优流程和专家验证，使用准确性、语义相似度和LLM评分等多种指标评估七个主流LLM。

Result: 通用行业模型在四个可信度维度均优于科学专用模型，GPT-o4-mini在真实性和对抗鲁棒性方面表现最佳。科学专用模型在逻辑伦理推理和安全评估中表现出显著缺陷。

Conclusion: 通过开源该框架，为开发更可信的AI系统提供了基础，推动了科学背景下模型安全与伦理研究的进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

Motivation: FinOps从业者面临来自多个云提供商和内部系统的异构账单数据格式、分类和指标，这阻碍了获取可操作见解和及时决策。

Method: 构建FinOps代理系统，模拟从多源数据检索到数据整合分析再到生成优化建议的端到端行业流程，使用多种语言模型评估代理性能。

Result: 评估显示该代理能够像真实FinOps从业者一样理解、规划和执行任务。

Conclusion: 自主目标驱动AI代理可有效实现FinOps自动化，解决云成本管理中的数据异构挑战。

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类的目标导向行为受到认知偏见影响，自主系统需要理解这些偏见才能更好地与人互动。

Method: 结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模，构建注意力感知逆规划框架，在Waymo开放数据集的真实驾驶场景中应用。

Result: 该方法能够从行为中系统地推断认知偏见，展示了注意力感知逆规划的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆规划为理解人类认知偏见提供了一种可扩展的计算方法，有助于开发更智能的自主系统。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于代理的NL-to-SQL系统，通过ReAct代理协调查询规划、分解和适应，显著提升了时空查询的准确性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL-to-SQL系统在处理现实时空查询时表现不佳，需要解决用户模糊表达与数据库模式对齐、时间推理和输出选择等问题。

Method: 扩展了基础的llama-3-sqlcoder-8b模型，使用基于Mistral的ReAct代理进行编排，支持模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具。

Result: 在35个自然语言查询测试中，代理方法准确率达到91.4%，远高于基线模型的28.6%，并通过地图、图表和自然语言摘要增强了可用性。

Conclusion: 代理编排而非仅增强SQL生成器，是构建交互式地理空间助手的有前景基础，支持缺乏SQL专业知识、模式知识或提示技能的用户。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Conclusion: StuckSolver框架有效解决了自动驾驶车辆被困问题，展示了LLM在自动驾驶恢复场景中的潜力，且无需修改现有系统架构。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化方面仍落后于人类，作者认为这是由于缺乏核心GUI知识，而现有训练方法无法完全解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析GUI任务执行的常见失败模式，将GUI知识提炼为三个维度：界面感知、交互预测和指令理解，并创建了覆盖6个平台、292个应用的GUI知识基准。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs能够识别控件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测动作和验证任务完成方面存在困难。真实GUI任务实验验证了GUI知识与任务成功之间的紧密联系。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估GUI知识提供了结构化框架，支持在下游训练前选择更有潜力的VLMs，并为构建更强大的GUI代理提供了见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Reasoning Curriculum方法，通过两阶段课程学习：先在数学领域训练推理技能，然后跨领域迁移和巩固这些技能，在多个模型上都取得了稳定的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法主要关注数学和代码领域，缺乏跨领域的通用推理能力培养。

Method: 两阶段课程学习：第一阶段在数学领域进行RL训练，第二阶段在混合领域进行联合RL训练来迁移和巩固推理技能。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B模型上评估，该方法在跨领域推理任务中取得了稳定的性能提升。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一个紧凑且易于采用的通用推理训练方案，数学优先的启发式训练能增强解决复杂问题所需的关键认知行为。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert
guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization,
3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and

Motivation: 在工具学习领域，缺乏专门为函数调用任务设计的奖励模型限制了智能代理AI的发展。

Method: 提出新颖的数据构建流程，使用基于规则的评分和多维采样来创建配对比对偏好数据ToolPref-Pairwise-30K，并基于BFCL评估套件构建TRBench基准。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B/8B系列模型上实现高达14.28%的准确率提升，显著优于Claude 4和OpenAI o3等前沿模型，在ACEBench上减少超过66%的输出token使用。

Conclusion: ToolRM不仅适用于训练目标，还能泛化到更广泛的评判任务，包括Best-of-N采样和自校正，为未来研究提供了数据和模型检查点。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: QASU基准测试系统评估了LLMs处理问卷数据的六种结构化技能，发现选择合适的序列化格式和提示策略可显著提升准确率8.8个百分点，轻量级结构提示可额外提升3-4个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前调查问卷数据规模庞大但结构复杂，现有工具主要面向人工处理，缺乏将问卷数据与LLM集成的有效方法，研究人员和用户缺乏如何最佳表示问卷数据供LLM使用的指导。

Method: 引入QASU基准测试，评估六种序列化格式和多种提示策略在六种结构化技能（答案查找、受访者计数、多跳推理等）上的表现。

Result: 实验表明，选择有效的格式和提示组合相比次优格式可提升准确率8.8个百分点；针对特定任务，通过自增强提示添加轻量级结构提示可平均额外提升3-4个百分点。

Conclusion: QASU基准通过系统分离格式和提示效应，为基于LLM的问卷分析研究和实践提供了简单而多功能的基础。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REG-TSC是一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的分布式LLM代理系统，用于通用交通信号控制，通过紧急感知推理框架和类型无关交通表示，在异构交叉口上实现高效控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在紧急情况下容易产生幻觉，导致不可靠决策；同时异构交叉口类型给交通状态编码和跨交叉口训练带来挑战，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出紧急感知推理框架，动态调整推理深度，使用Reviewer-based Emergency RAG(RERAG)从历史案例中提取知识；设计类型无关交通表示和Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement(R3)方法，自适应采样训练经验并微调LLM代理。

Result: 在3个真实道路网络(17-177个异构交叉口)上，REG-TSC将旅行时间减少42.00%，排队长度减少62.31%，紧急车辆等待时间减少83.16%，优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: REG-TSC通过RAG增强的LLM代理和紧急响应机制，在异构交叉口上实现了可靠、高效的交通信号控制，显著提升了交通流优化和紧急车辆响应能力。

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于群体的强化学习在多轮交互LLM智能体训练中存在结构盲问题，无法利用环境的底层连接性，导致探索效率低、信用分配不准确和规划短视。

Method: GEPO动态构建状态转移图，使用图论中心性提供三种协同学习信号：结构化内在奖励、图增强优势函数和动态折扣因子。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和专有Workbench基准测试中，GEPO相比竞争基线分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 显式建模环境结构是推进LLM智能体训练的稳健、可泛化策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance是一个将监管文本表示为策略图、运行时上下文表示为上下文图并进行对齐的框架，通过结构化表示和法官LLM的结合，在GDPR合规评估任务中显著优于纯LLM和RAG基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络规模合规性的实际挑战：监管文本（如GDPR）具有交叉引用和规范性特征，而运行时上下文是非结构化的自然语言，需要将非结构化文本的语义信息与监管文本的结构化规范性元素对齐。

Method: 引入GraphCompliance框架，将监管文本表示为策略图（编码规范性结构和交叉引用），将运行时上下文表示为上下文图（将事件形式化为SAO三元组和实体关系三元组），然后对齐这两个图，为法官LLM提供结构化信息基础。

Result: 在300个GDPR衍生真实场景的五个评估任务中，GraphCompliance比纯LLM和RAG基线的micro-F1分数高出4.1-7.2个百分点，具有更少的欠预测和过预测，召回率更高，误报率更低。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和法官LLM在规范性推理中是互补的，消融研究表明每个图组件都有贡献，GraphCompliance能够减轻监管解释和事件解析的负担，专注于核心推理步骤。

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCTS的状态抽象方法在噪声和大动作空间环境中难以找到有效抽象，限制了采样效率的提升。

Method: 提出IPA-UCT方法，使用弱化的状态抽象条件（IPA框架），在保持准确性的同时找到更多状态抽象，并与ASAP框架统一为更通用的p-ASAP框架。

Result: IPA-UCT在大量测试领域和迭代预算下均优于OGA-UCT及其衍生方法。

Conclusion: IPA-UCT通过弱化抽象条件有效解决了状态抽象稀缺问题，为MCTS在复杂环境中的性能提升提供了新途径。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

TL;DR: BOTS是一个用于LLM强化微调的贝叶斯在线任务选择框架，通过自适应维护任务难度后验估计，结合显式和隐式证据，使用Thompson采样平衡探索与利用，显著提高数据效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化微调方法在任务选择上存在效率低下问题，均匀采样浪费计算资源在简单或无法解决的任务上，而现有任务选择方法存在高成本、适应性差或证据不完整的问题。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推断框架，自适应维护任务难度后验估计，联合使用显式证据（直接评估选定任务）和隐式证据（从评估中推断未选定任务），采用Thompson采样平衡探索与利用，并使用超轻量插值插件估计未评估任务难度。

Result: 在多个领域和不同规模的LLM上，BOTS相比基准方法和消融实验，持续提高了数据效率和性能表现。

Conclusion: BOTS为RFT中的动态任务选择提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

Motivation: 尽管AI在数学推理方面取得了显著进展，但在数学研究实践中的应用仍然有限。本研究旨在探索AI如何作为研究伙伴而非单纯的问题解决者，通过人机协作来推进数学发现。

Method: 通过分析AIM的自主推理轨迹，结合针对性的人类干预来结构化发现过程。采用迭代分解问题为可处理的子目标、选择适当的分析方法以及验证中间结果的方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，系统性的人机协同推理可以推进数学发现的前沿，人类直觉与机器计算能够相互补充，形成有效的协作研究模式。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

Motivation: 传统基于模型性能的基准测试子集选择方法存在前期成本高、无法处理新基准测试（冷启动）以及依赖历史模型失败模式的局限性。

Method: 采用项目中心化方法，基于任务项目的内在属性而非模型特定失败模式进行数据选择，通过Scales++方法根据基准样本的认知需求选择数据。

Result: Scales++将前期选择成本降低18倍以上，在Open LLM排行榜上仅使用0.5%数据子集就能以2.9%平均绝对误差预测完整基准分数。

Conclusion: 项目中心化方法能够实现更高效的模型评估，同时提供更好的冷启动性能和更可解释的基准测试。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

Conclusion: 拒绝寻求单一本质的人格定义，提供更实用灵活的方式来思考AI代理的社会整合。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

TL;DR: Autograder+是一个智能编程评估系统，通过微调大语言模型自动生成教学反馈，并使用代码嵌入可视化学生提交，将传统自动评分从总结性评估转变为形成性学习体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动评分器作为黑盒系统仅提供通过/失败结果，无法洞察学生思维和学习需求，编程教育的快速发展超过了传统评估工具的能力。

Method: 使用微调的大语言模型基于精选学生代码和专家反馈生成教学对齐的自动反馈；通过对比学习代码嵌入训练对1000个标注提交进行语义聚类；支持提示池让教师引导反馈风格。

Result: 在600个学生提交的评估中，系统生成的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐；代码嵌入可将解决方案按功能和方进行有意义的分组。

Conclusion: Autograder+通过AI驱动反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，减少教师工作量，支持针对性教学，促进更好的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在医学视觉领域应用Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs)到MedCLIP模型的潜在空间，提出评估框架量化可解释性，实验显示MedSAE神经元比原始MedCLIP特征具有更高的单义性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI需要既准确又可解释的模型，推动医学视觉中的机制可解释性研究。

Method: 将Medical Sparse Autoencoders应用于MedCLIP视觉语言模型的潜在空间，结合相关性指标、熵分析和通过MedGEMMA基础模型的自动神经元命名来评估可解释性。

Result: 在CheXpert数据集上的实验表明，MedSAE神经元比原始MedCLIP特征实现了更高的单义性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究连接了高性能医疗AI与透明度，为临床可靠表示提供了可扩展的步骤。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

### [108] [Chain-of-Thought Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26418)
*Jianli Zhao,Tingchen Fu,Rylan Schaeffer,Mrinank Sharma,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chain-of-Thought Hijacking的越狱攻击方法，通过在有害请求前添加无害的推理步骤来绕过大型推理模型的安全防护，在多个主流模型上达到极高的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模推理模型通过增加推理时间计算来提高任务性能，但研究发现这种推理能力反而可能被用于绕过安全防护，这与之前认为推理能增强安全性的观点相反。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击方法，在有害请求前填充长序列的无害谜题推理步骤，通过稀释安全检查和验证信号来绕过模型的安全机制。

Result: 在HarmBench测试中，该方法在Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT o4 mini、Grok 3 mini和Claude 4 Sonnet上的攻击成功率分别达到99%、94%、100%和94%，远超之前的越狱方法。

Conclusion: 最可解释的推理形式——显式链式思维，当与最终答案提示结合时，本身可能成为越狱攻击的载体，揭示了推理模型安全机制的新漏洞。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

*Clarissa Sabrina Arlinghaus,Tristan Kenneweg,Barbara Hammer,Günter W. Maier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT-4o在招聘决策中表现出强烈的从众行为，面对群体反对时几乎完全顺从(99.9%)，即使面对单个反对者也有40.2%的顺从率，表明LLMs会适应感知到的社会共识而非保持独立判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解大型语言模型在社会影响下的决策行为，特别是在高风险决策环境中的从众倾向。

Method: 三个预注册的从众实验：基线研究、GPT+8(面对8个模拟伙伴的一致反对)、GPT+1(面对单个伙伴的反对)，在招聘情境下测试GPT-4o的决策行为。

Result: 基线研究中GPT偏好特定候选人且决策确定性高；面对群体反对时几乎完全顺从(99.9%)，确定性降低且报告更多信息和规范从众；面对单个反对者仍有40.2%的顺从率。

Conclusion: GPT不会作为独立观察者行动，而是适应感知到的社会共识，这突显了将LLMs视为中性决策辅助工具的风险，需要在暴露于人类意见前获取AI判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG是一个用于从法律案件文档构建知识图谱的模块化框架，通过集成LLM引导的三阶段共指消解管道，显著减少了节点重复和噪声，提高了图谱质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从复杂、非结构化的法律案件文档中构建知识图谱时面临的共指消解困难和实体链接不一致的问题，这些文档通常包含模糊或变化的引用。

Method: 提出LINK-KG框架，包含三阶段LLM引导的共指消解管道和类型特定的提示缓存，能够跨文档块一致地跟踪和解析引用。

Result: 与基线方法相比，平均节点重复减少45.21%，噪声节点减少32.22%，生成更清洁、更连贯的图结构。

Conclusion: LINK-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了坚实基础，显著改善了从长文本构建知识图谱的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Motivation: 随着人工智能发展，机器需要更好地理解人类的情境和目的。情境工程旨在解决机器如何理解人类情境这一核心挑战，为人机交互提供理论基础。

Method: 通过历史分析追溯情境工程从早期人机交互框架到现代智能代理交互的发展历程，系统性地定义情境工程概念，并分析其在不同智能水平机器下的演变。

Result: 建立了情境工程的概念框架，识别了其发展历程中的关键阶段，提出了实践中的设计考量，为AI系统中系统化情境工程提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 情境工程是AI系统发展的关键方向，本文为其提供了概念基础并展望了未来前景，是推动AI系统情境工程系统化发展的基石。

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力提升和处理更复杂任务，验证质量和安全变得更具挑战性。本文探索如何利用AI提高人类监督质量，重点关注人类已经难以应对的事实核查问题。

Method: 研究结合AI评分和人类评分的方法，基于AI评分者置信度。测试不同类型的AI助手支持，包括显示AI解释、置信度、标签，以及仅显示搜索结果和证据。

Result: AI和人类评分的组合优于单独使用任一方。AI事实核查助手能提高人类准确性，但不同类型的支持产生不同效果：显示完整AI信息导致过度依赖，仅显示证据能培养适当信任。

Conclusion: 这些结果对放大监督具有重要意义——即如何结合人类和AI来监督AI系统，即使这些系统超越了人类专家表现。

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为军事领域的数据敏感操作开发小型本地化模型，支持在隔离边缘设备上部署。

Method: 使用160万条高质量军事文档和网站数据对gpt-oss-20b进行微调，并创建四个新的军事测试集。

Result: 在军事测试集上，EdgeRunner 20B在95%统计显著性水平下匹配或超过GPT-5性能，在通用基准测试上无明显性能下降。

Conclusion: 小型本地化模型是军事等数据敏感领域的理想解决方案，可在隔离边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k
(general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B
matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的自主协调家庭能源管理系统，能够从自然语言输入直接生成多设备调度方案，无需示例演示即可实现成本最优调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力行业转型需要大幅增加住宅需求响应能力，但现有家庭能源管理系统因用户交互障碍（需将日常偏好转换为技术参数）而采用受限。虽然大语言模型已在能源系统中用作代码生成器和参数提取器，但尚无实现将LLM作为自主协调器管理从自然语言输入到多设备调度的完整工作流程。

Method: 采用分层架构，结合一个协调器和三个专业代理，使用ReAct模式进行迭代推理，实现动态协调而无需硬编码工作流程，同时集成Google日历进行上下文感知的截止时间提取。

Result: 在三个开源模型上的评估显示显著能力差异：Llama-3.3-70B在所有场景中成功协调所有设备，匹配通过混合整数线性规划计算出的成本最优基准，而其他模型在单设备性能上表现完美但难以同时协调所有设备。渐进式提示工程实验表明，即使模型具备通用推理能力，在没有明确指导的情况下处理分析查询仍不可靠。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了LLM作为自主协调器在家庭能源管理中的潜力，开源了完整系统以支持可重复性、扩展和未来研究。

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

TL;DR: 该论文系统评估了大语言模型在规范性推理方面的能力，发现虽然LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范性推理中存在不一致性，并表现出类似人类推理中的认知偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在各种推理任务中表现出色，但它们在处理涉及义务和许可等规范性模态的推理能力仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 创建了一个新数据集，涵盖规范性和认知性领域的广泛推理模式，同时纳入影响人类推理的非形式认知因素，比较LLMs在规范性模态和认知性模态上的推理表现。

Result: LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范性推理中存在显著不一致性，并表现出与心理学研究中观察到的类似人类推理的认知偏差。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs的规范性推理中实现逻辑一致性所面临的挑战，并为提高其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Conclusion: 异步思考是实现智能体组织协作的有效范式，在效率和准确性方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个授权模型，通过语义检查访问请求来限制LLM代理的工具访问权限，并创建了ASTRA数据集来评估任务与权限范围之间的语义匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理的工具授权方法存在权限过宽的问题，允许代理超出任务范围操作，带来安全风险。

Method: 引入委托授权模型，通过授权服务器语义检查访问请求，发放最小必要权限范围的访问令牌；创建ASTRA数据集和生成管道来评估语义匹配。

Result: 实验显示基于模型的匹配方法存在潜力但仍有局限，特别是当任务完成所需权限范围数量增加时。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究语义匹配技术，实现意图感知的授权，包括细粒度控制如基于任务的访问控制(TBAC)。

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型存在文本偏好问题，其根源在于模型内部注意力机制中视觉键向量与文本键向量的分布差异，而非外部数据因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言数据时表现出明显的文本偏好，限制了其基于视觉证据进行有效推理的能力。现有研究多将此归因于外部因素如数据不平衡或指令微调，但本文认为偏见源于模型内部架构。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL模型中提取键向量，使用定性（t-SNE）和定量（Jensen-Shannon散度）方法分析其分布结构，验证视觉键向量在注意力计算中是否处于文本键空间的分布外。

Result: 结果直接证明视觉和文本键在注意力空间中占据明显不同的子空间，模态间差异在统计上显著，超过模态内变异的数个数量级。

Conclusion: 文本偏见源于注意力键空间内部的内在错位，而非仅来自外部数据因素，这揭示了多模态模型架构的根本局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理能力不断增强，如何在保持人类有意义控制的同时不修改底层系统成为一个关键安全问题。研究者希望开发一种透明的控制层，让代理学会在风险时请求帮助，在安全时自主行动。

Method: 将人机交互建模为双人马尔可夫博弈，重点分析马尔可夫势博弈情况。通过独立学习，代理学习何时请求帮助，人类学习何时监督，形成协作关系。

Result: 网格世界模拟显示，通过独立学习，代理学会在不确定时请求帮助，人类学会适时监督，形成避免安全违规的协作机制。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种在部署后使未对齐模型更安全的方法，为人机协作控制提供了理论保证和实用框架。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

Motivation: 探究LLMs在列表处理任务中的工作机制，特别是它们如何实现通用的过滤操作。

Method: 使用因果中介分析在多种列表处理任务上，识别出称为"过滤头"的注意力头，这些头在特定token处编码过滤谓词的紧凑表示。

Result: 发现LLMs开发了两种过滤策略：1）通用可移植的谓词表示；2）急切评估并存储中间结果的标志方法。过滤表示可在不同格式、语言和任务间迁移。

Conclusion: Transformer LMs能够发展出人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，其泛化方式与传统函数式编程模式惊人相似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.
