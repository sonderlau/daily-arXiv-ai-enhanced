We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher\nKnowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal\nfeature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to\ndeliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method\nbegins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative\nfeatures from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters\nand further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge\ndistillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple\nmodalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the\nteacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student\noutputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we\ndesign an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher\ndistillation as a multi-objective optimization problem.

Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is\nmodel-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed\nglobal-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners\ncan harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving\nvisual fidelity in high-resolution environments."}

A\nmature climate OSSE framework should be able to quantitatively compare the\nability of proposed observing system architectures to answer a climate-related\nquestion, thus offering added value throughout the mission design process,\nwhich is subject to increasingly rapid advances in instrument and satellite\ntechnology. Technical considerations include selection of observational\nbenchmarks and climate projection metrics, approaches to pinpoint the sources\nof model physics uncertainty that dominate uncertainty in projections, and the\nuse of instrument simulators.

Agents are visually\nrepresented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of\nthree classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)\ndatasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving\nneighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with\nmovement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative\nemotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,\nemotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of\nexperiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and\nscenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy\nclassifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,\nemotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By\ncontrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional\nclusters and resilience to emotional disruptions.

In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an\neffective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video\nunderstanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.\nSpecifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise\nSurgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video\nencoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video\nReconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate\nsurgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware\nMultimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved\nmultimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of\nsurgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble\nto efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.\nExtensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,\nincluding captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness\nof our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding.

To address\nthis modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment\nfor LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting\nframework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw\ntime series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive\nstatistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,\nproducing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context\nalignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling\nstrategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual\nembeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings.

This paper, therefore, attempts to directly\nleverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any\nmodality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive\nPoint-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a\nmodest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without\nheterogeneous mappings.

We address the first challenge\nwith the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a\nmean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization\nand the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when\nthe risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the\nsecond challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V\noptimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We\niteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that\nis used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V\nproblems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is\nmonotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both\naverage and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure\nand prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted\nfor validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that\nsolves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type\nalgorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving\nMDPs with other fractional objectives."}

Through our AI-assisted data\npipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated\nsamples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times\nthe number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a\ntriplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected\nresponse. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal\nreward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and\nsemi-scalar.

Additionally, they\ntend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training\ndata, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this\nstudy, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named\nMV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the\njoint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from\nmulti-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State\nSpace (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial\narrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's\ntraditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning\n(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate\nthat MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU\nPanoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP\n(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations.

In this article, we trace the historical development of\nscientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for\nscientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from\ndata-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic\nreasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns\nand propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on\nrigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone\nof AI-assisted discovery."}

However, concerns remain about potential biases related\nto skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is\nchallenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational\ndemands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that\novercomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across\nvarying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the\nconvolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches\nand the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary\nchannels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This\napproach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on\nconventional statistical methods.

On the other hand, the brain\nencoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with\nsufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this\nproblem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as\nexisting approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses\nto validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our\nframework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP\nvisual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,\nand a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct\nbiologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike\nconventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for\nconditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between\nvisual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained\nalignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two\nmultimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its\neffectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we\nvisualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both\ndatasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and\ninter-subject variations in M/EEG signals."}

While\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their\napplication has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within\nhuman-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open\nquestion. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver\nfor the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved\nfragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint\nscaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative\nself-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a\nviable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy\nprocess, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the\nscoring function.

Few-step\ndiffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on\nlarge, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often\ntoo costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These\nrequirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely\non full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for\npost-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather\nthan model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched\nachieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn\nquantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,\nwhich combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for\nfine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of\ncalibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.\nQ-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16\n4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step\nPhased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation\nare complementary for high-fidelity generation.

However, the labeling process, especially for\nordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is\nprone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the\nperformance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses\nthe problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image\nclassification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal\nAdaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy\nlabels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution\nLearning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in\nordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and\nstandard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than\ndiscarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and\nmake optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)\nand disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric\nGaussian noise scenarios.

With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem\nfrom a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer\nmodel that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given\nsequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures\nlong-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive\nfield for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and\ndecoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head\nemploys the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation.

By\nintroducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method\neffectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On\nthis basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark\ndataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale\narchitectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image\nreconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating\noverfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super\nresolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale\narchitectures under complex conditions.

In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as\norgans, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often\nanisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In\nthis study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),\narguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific\nchallenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have\nproven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean\ndistances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional\nEncodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,\nbut they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),\na generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and\ndomain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against\ncommonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ\nclassification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in\nechocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can\nsignificantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on\nthe shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data.

In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI\nimage segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves\nmultiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL).

Empirical evaluation demonstrates that\nUI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.\nOn GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on\nWindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines\nsuch as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean\nnormalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level\nperformance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,\nOpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to\nlong-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,\nhighlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of\ntraining dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and\nefficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's\npotential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization\nto real-world interactive scenarios."}
