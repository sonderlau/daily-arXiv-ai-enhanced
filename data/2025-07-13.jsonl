To mitigate these issues, we propose a\nMulti-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL.

To this end, many architectures for accelerating\nand simulating SNNs have been developed, including Loihi, TrueNorth, and\nSpiNNaker.

This\nadaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in\nresponse to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding\nframework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple\nconstraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit\ntied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. A key feature of our\ncontribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP) use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework\nthat generalizes existing optimal population codes.

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction.

Adverse weather significantly degrades\nimage quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face\nimage restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)\nand diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due\nto the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced\ndegradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework\nthat integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature\nTransformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The\nlocal SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the\nlocal statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those\nof high-quality (HQ) counterparts.

To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first\ninvestigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation\nby deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use\nprimarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly\napplying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,\nlimited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable\nExamples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on\nlarge-scale video datasets.

Traditional prognostic models, which\nrely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,\noften fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in\nsuboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations\nby proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,\nincluding CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and\ngenomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance\nclinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive\ndataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,\nand CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are\nemployed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while\nMeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For\nstructured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.\nThese models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each\nmodality, which are then fused through an early and late integration\narchitecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary\ninformation from multiple sources.

In\ncontrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length\nrepresentations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or\nfamiliarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating\nvariable-length representations but typically require test-time search over\nmultiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov\nComplexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which\npredicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward\npass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a\nproxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely\nresembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to\nconditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.\nKARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a\nsingle pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of\nencoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.\nAdditionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive\nImage Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted\nimage complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.\nout-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition."}

However, no\nbenchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this\ngap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a\ndiagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception\nof subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box\nevaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and\nspatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization.

However,\nthe role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional\ngeneralization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when\na common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this\npaper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining\ndataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM\nperformance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from\nsingle-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual\ninformation (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words\nco-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using\nsynthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a\nstrong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot\naccuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap\nbetween images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even\naccuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the\nimage. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by\nediting them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of\nr=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs\nbuilt on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings\nhighlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional\ngeneralization in multimodal models without scaling the training data\ncombinatorially.
