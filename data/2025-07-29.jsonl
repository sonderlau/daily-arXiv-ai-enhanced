Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of\nimages, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This\npaper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive\ngamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of\nthe low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive\ngamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively\nat different illumination levels suitable for the image without human\nintervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative\nevaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved\nlow-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color\ndistribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a\nmore efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple\napplications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical\nimages, and photography in low-light environments."}

While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)\nand data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to\nenhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,\nincreasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can\ninduce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model\nperformance, a phenomenon known as the \"Data Addition Dilemma\". While the\ntraditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming\nexchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data\npooling.

This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for evaluating\nthe ability of SRE to provide historical rainfall information for agricultural\napplications, primarily through comparison with ground based measurements. The\nmethodology comprises four main steps: spatial consistency checks, main\ncomparisons, bias correction, and application specific summaries. The\nmethodology makes use of graphical summaries, standard comparison metrics, and\nMarkov chain models. We describe how users can apply this methodology to\nevaluate rainfall estimates for specific applications, complementing existing\nvalidation studies. Evaluation cases are presented to demonstrate the\nmethodology using five widely used satellite and reanalysis rainfall products\nand ground-based measurements from 12 stations in Africa and the Caribbean. The\ncase studies demonstrate how the methodology can be applied to examine multiple\naspects of the rainfall estimates.

Materials and Methods: We curated a\ntraining dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134\npatients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct\nfeatures. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated\nCoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline\nbased on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out\nhuman-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently\nreviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact\nmatch accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and\nradiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning\nimproved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%\nto 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved\n(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no\nstatistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was\nhigh (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference\nwith the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT\n(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels\non par with radiologists.

Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery\ntrajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and\nresilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral\ncontrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and\nhighly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional\nflood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides\nthe temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a\nhierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this\nchallenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial\nmulti-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and\nbare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between\nspectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early\nchecking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a\nlightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the\nflagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines\nboundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.\nWe validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and\npost-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average\nF1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably\nsharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional\nsingle-stage U-Net baselines."}

Through detailed visualizations of linear\nsubspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various\nmodel scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations\nuniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that\nprojecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace\ncan preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear\nstructures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction\nsignificantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation\nengineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical\ninsights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden\ndimensions.

The key challenge\nlies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches\nrely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they\ninherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this\nwork, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token\ntransitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations\nprovides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we\npropose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.\nSpecifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their\nimportance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which\nmeasures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token\nrepresentations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how\nstrongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal\nperformance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight\nbenchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half.

Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale\nprediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on\nhigh-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing\nlightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving\nthe fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled\nanchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while\nmaintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable\nacceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to\na 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B."}

To bridge this\ngap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for\nsequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,\nwhich seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of\nboth channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the\ninherent \"temporal-like\" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally,\nwe define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential\n(TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across\nsequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach\nleverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual\ninformation while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions,\nthereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential\nsegmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets\ndemonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics,\nestablishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor\nsegmentation."}

Additionally, it demonstrated consistent\nimprovements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction\nimage parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction.\nThis work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction\ninto structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical\nresearch."}

However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal\nknowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses\nchallenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity\nrepresentation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or\ngate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in\nmulti-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of\nComplementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a\nComplementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an\nEntropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits\nboth intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and\nmulti-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we\nintroduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically\nprioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training\neffectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nsurpassing existing approaches."}

Compared with binary spike outputs, their\ninherent floating-point dynamics are more worthy of attention. The threshold\nlevel and reset mode of neurons play a crucial role in determining the number\nand timing of spikes. The existing hard reset method causes information loss,\nwhile the improved soft reset method adopts a uniform treatment for neurons. In\nresponse to this, this paper designs an adaptive reset neuron, establishing the\ncorrelation between input, output and reset, and integrating a simple yet\neffective threshold adjustment strategy. It achieves excellent performance on\nvarious datasets while maintaining the advantage of low energy consumption."}
