### [1] [From Propagator to Oscillator: The Dual Role of Symmetric Differential Equations in Neural Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22916)
*Kun Jiang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于对称微分方程的新型神经元模型，深入研究了其功能多样性，揭示了系统的功能二元性，并通过模拟验证了参数调整对功能模式转换的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于先前提出的神经元模型，进一步探索其内在动力学和功能多样性，为神经形态工程提供理论支持。

Method: 通过系统探索参数空间和数学分析工具，理论揭示了模型的功能二元性，并引入中间状态度量进行模拟验证。

Result: 模型表现出两种轨迹行为：稳定信号传播器和自激振荡信号发生器，通过参数调整可实现功能模式转换。

Conclusion: 研究为神经元模型在神经形态工程中的广泛应用提供了理论基础和功能路线图。

Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric
differential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal
propagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into
the intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By
systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of
mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core
property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct
trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable
signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained
self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable
effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we
introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation
results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be
induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection
structure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by
introducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the
dual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm
generation, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear
functional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic
engineering.

### [2] [Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization for Fast and Reliable Parameter Extraction in Thermoreflectance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22960)
*Bingjia Xiao,Tao Chen,Wenbin Zhang,Xin Qian,Puqing Jiang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种AI驱动的混合优化框架，结合全局和局部优化方法，显著提高了FDTR测量中参数提取的收敛速度和准确性，其中HPSO表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDTR测量中的参数提取是一个高维、非线性的逆问题，现有全局优化算法难以在短时间内可靠收敛。

Method: 提出四种混合优化算法（HGA、HQGA、HPSO、HFWA），结合全局算法和局部细化方法，并在GaN/Si异质结构的FDTR测量中测试其性能。

Result: HPSO在60秒内80%的试验达到目标精度，表现最优；而HGA、HQGA和HFWA分别只有30%、30%和20%。在1000秒的测试中，仅HPSO、PSO和HGA能稳定达到目标精度，且HPSO收敛速度最快。

Conclusion: HPSO为热计量中的逆问题提供了一种通用解决方案，并可扩展到其他模型拟合技术。

Abstract: Frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) is a widely used technique for
characterizing thermal properties of multilayer thin films. However, extracting
multiple parameters from FDTR measurements presents a nonlinear inverse problem
due to its high dimensionality and multimodal, non-convex solution space. This
study evaluates four popular global optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithm
(GA), Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and
Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), for extracting parameters from FDTR measurements of
a GaN/Si heterostructure. However, none achieve reliable convergence within 60
seconds. To improve convergence speed and accuracy, we propose an AI-driven
hybrid optimization framework that combines each global algorithm with a
Quasi-Newton local refinement method, resulting in four hybrid variants: HGA,
HQGA, HPSO, and HFWA. Among these, HPSO outperforms all other methods, with 80%
of trials reaching the target fitness value within 60 seconds, showing greater
robustness and a lower risk of premature convergence. In contrast, only 30% of
HGA and HQGA trials and 20% of HFWA trials achieve this threshold. We then
evaluate the worst-case performance across 100 independent trials for each
algorithm when the time is extended to 1000 seconds. Only HPSO, PSO, and HGA
consistently reach the target accuracy, with HPSO converging five times faster
than the others. HPSO provides a general-purpose solution for inverse problems
in thermal metrology and can be readily extended to other model-fitting
techniques.

### [3] [Finger Force Decoding from Motor Units Activity on Neuromorphic Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23474)
*Farah Baracat,Giacomo Indiveri,Elisa Donati*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于运动神经元尖峰信号的低功耗实时手指力量估计方法，利用神经形态处理器实现嵌入式解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于EMG的解码方法需要大量数据和计算资源，限制了实时嵌入式系统的应用。

Method: 从高密度EMG提取运动神经元尖峰信号，驱动神经形态处理器上的脉冲神经网络进行实时推理。

Result: 实现了精确的手指力量预测，且能耗极低。

Conclusion: 为假肢和可穿戴神经技术的嵌入式解码提供了新可能。

Abstract: Accurate finger force estimation is critical for next-generation
human-machine interfaces. Traditional electromyography (EMG)-based decoding
methods using deep learning require large datasets and high computational
resources, limiting their use in real-time, embedded systems. Here, we propose
a novel approach that performs finger force regression using spike trains from
individual motor neurons, extracted from high-density EMG. These biologically
grounded signals drive a spiking neural network implemented on a mixed-signal
neuromorphic processor. Unlike prior work that encodes EMG into events, our
method exploits spike timing on motor units to perform low-power, real-time
inference. This is the first demonstration of motor neuron-based continuous
regression computed directly on neuromorphic hardware. Our results confirm
accurate finger-specific force prediction with minimal energy use, opening new
possibilities for embedded decoding in prosthetics and wearable
neurotechnology.

### [4] [Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033)
*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络的动态时间步长训练策略（PATA），用于优化NeRF模型的资源消耗，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF模型在3D重建和渲染中表现优异，但计算资源消耗大，限制了其在资源受限场景的应用。脉冲神经网络（SNNs）因其高效能特性成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 提出PATA框架，结合动态时间步长训练策略，自动平衡渲染质量和时间步长，实现场景自适应推理。

Result: 实验表明，PATA在保持渲染质量的同时，减少了64%的推理时间步长和61.55%的运行功耗。

Conclusion: PATA为NeRF模型在资源受限场景中的应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark, EGE-Math Solutions Assessment
Benchmark, for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on their ability to
assess hand-written mathematical solutions. Unlike existing benchmarks that

solutions, identifying mistakes, and assigning grades according to fixed
criteria. We compile 122 scanned solutions from the Russian Unified State Exam
(EGE) together with official expert grades, and evaluate seven modern VLMs from
Google, OpenAI, Arcee AI, and Alibaba Cloud in three inference modes. The
results reveal current limitations in mathematical reasoning and human-rubric
alignment, opening new research avenues in AI-assisted assessment. You can find

### [6] [Robust and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting for Urban Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23006)
*Zhensheng Yuan,Haozhi Huang,Zhen Xiong,Di Wang,Guanghua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速重建和实时渲染城市规模场景的框架，通过并行训练和可控细节策略优化效率与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视角捕获中外观变化对重建和渲染的负面影响，同时提升城市规模场景处理的效率与质量。

Method: 采用场景分区并行训练、基于可见性的图像选择、可控细节策略和外观变换模块，结合增强模块（如深度正则化）提高重建质量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在城市规模场景重建中效率和视觉质量均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了城市规模场景重建的挑战，并在效率和视觉保真度上表现优异。

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

### [7] [Modeling Human Gaze Behavior with Diffusion Models for Unified Scanpath Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23021)
*Giuseppe Cartella,Vittorio Cuculo,Alessandro D'Amelio,Marcella Cornia,Giuseppe Boccignone,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScanDiff结合扩散模型与Vision Transformers，生成多样且真实的注视扫描路径，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型生成平均行为，无法捕捉人类视觉探索的变异性。

Method: 结合扩散模型与Vision Transformers，利用扩散模型的随机性生成多样扫描路径，并引入文本条件实现任务驱动生成。

Result: 在基准数据集上，ScanDiff在自由观看和任务驱动场景中均优于现有方法，生成更多样且准确的扫描路径。

Conclusion: ScanDiff能更好地捕捉人类视觉行为的复杂性，推动注视预测研究。

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

### [8] [Recovering Diagnostic Value: Super-Resolution-Aided Echocardiographic Classification in Resource-Constrained Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23027)
*Krishan Agyakari Raja Babu,Om Prabhu,Annu,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习超分辨率技术在低质量超声心动图上的应用，显著提升了分类准确性，尤其是SRResNet模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限环境下超声心动图质量差，影响诊断模型效果，超分辨率技术有望提升图像质量。

Method: 使用SRGAN和SRResNet模型增强低质量图像，并在CAMUS数据集上评估2CH vs. 4CH和ED vs. ES分类任务。

Result: SRResNet显著提升性能指标，同时计算高效。

Conclusion: 超分辨率技术可有效恢复低质量超声心动图的诊断价值，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

### [9] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive是一种单分支视觉语言架构，通过处理前摄像头图像、高清地图、LiDAR深度和文本路径点，结合新颖的平滑损失和两阶段交叉注意力块，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要在毫秒内做出反应，同时理解道路几何和交通意图以应对复杂情况。NovaDrive旨在通过简化架构和优化注意力机制，提高实时推理能力。

Method: 采用单分支架构处理多模态输入，使用两阶段交叉注意力块对齐路径点与高清地图，并通过平滑损失减少突变控制。基于LLaMA-3.2视觉语言模型微调。

Result: 在nuScenes/Waymo子集上，成功率提升至84%（+4%），路径效率（SPL）达0.66（+0.11），碰撞频率降至1.2%（-1.4%）。

Conclusion: NovaDrive通过简化架构和优化注意力机制，显著提升了自动驾驶性能，同时缩短路径和减少能耗，适用于其他具身AI领域。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

### [10] [Reference-Guided Diffusion Inpainting For Multimodal Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23058)
*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了两种新颖的合成数据生成方法MObI和AnydoorMed，分别用于自动驾驶和医学图像分析，通过扩散模型实现高真实感和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实数据采集成本高且复杂，合成数据方法在安全关键应用中变得重要，但需要高真实感和可控性。

Method: MObI利用扩散模型实现多模态对象修复，支持3D边界框条件；AnydoorMed扩展至医学图像，实现参考引导的异常修复。

Result: 两种方法展示了在多模态场景中生成高真实感、可控的合成数据的能力。

Conclusion: 基础模型可适应不同感知模态，为构建高度真实和可控的多模态反事实场景铺平道路。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive是一个结合视觉和语言的单一模型，通过融合摄像头、地图和路径点数据实现自动驾驶，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要几何精度和语义理解，但现有方法通常分开处理这些需求。XYZ-Drive旨在通过单一模型实现高效、透明的驾驶。

Method: XYZ-Drive使用轻量级目标中心交叉注意力层融合摄像头、地图和路径点数据，并通过部分微调的LLaMA-3.2 11B模型输出控制指令。

Result: 在MD-NEX基准测试中，XYZ-Drive达到95%成功率和0.80 SPL，性能提升15%，碰撞率减半，同时效率显著提高。

Conclusion: 早期、令牌级别的意图和地图布局融合能够实现准确、透明且实时的自动驾驶。

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的细粒度图像分类方法E-FineR，结合大语言模型和视觉语言模型，实现了开放集识别，并在零样本和少样本分类中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统细粒度图像分类方法依赖固定词汇和封闭集分类，难以适应新类别频繁出现的现实场景。现有方法未能充分利用大语言模型的潜力，且依赖猜测的类别名称。

Method: 提出E-FineR方法，无需训练，结合大语言模型和视觉语言模型，通过语言驱动的理解实现细粒度分类。

Result: E-FineR在细粒度视觉识别中达到SOTA效果，并在零样本和少样本分类中表现优异，无需人工干预。

Conclusion: E-FineR支持从固定标签预测转向灵活的语言驱动理解，具有可扩展性和通用性，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多种互补概念的新方法，用于开放词汇3D实例分割（OV-3DIS），通过两阶段方案（3D提案生成和实例分类）实现最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇3D实例分割方法中的概念虽互补但未有效结合，需设计新方案以整合并优化这些概念。

Method: 采用两阶段方案：1）基于3D跟踪的提案生成与迭代合并/移除；2）使用Alpha-CLIP（带对象掩码）和标准化最大相似度（SMS）评分进行分类。

Result: 在ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上实现了所有AP和AR指标的SOTA性能，甚至超过封闭词汇方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合互补概念并优化关键挑战，提出的方法显著提升了开放词汇3D实例分割的性能。

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

TL;DR: X-NeMo是一种基于扩散模型的零样本肖像动画方法，通过驱动视频生成静态肖像的动画，解决了身份泄漏和表情捕捉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中的身份泄漏和难以捕捉细微及极端表情的问题。

Method: 提出端到端训练框架，提取1D身份无关运动描述符，通过交叉注意力控制生成过程，并使用双GAN解码器和数据增强优化。

Result: X-NeMo超越现有方法，生成高表现力动画且身份相似度高。

Conclusion: X-NeMo通过创新设计有效解决了身份泄漏和表情捕捉问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要光照校准或中间线索（如每视角法线图），而该方法直接从原始图像单阶段优化所有场景参数。

Method: 使用神经隐式场表示几何和反射率，结合阴影感知体积渲染；空间网络预测有符号距离和反射率潜在码，反射率网络基于潜在码和角度编码的方向估计反射率。

Result: 在形状和光照估计精度上优于现有方法，能处理视角未对齐的多光照图像和复杂几何反射率物体。

Conclusion: 该方法无需中间步骤，直接优化场景参数，表现出优越性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

Result: 在Rain100L和Rain100H数据集上分别达到33.29 dB和26.16 dB的PSNR。

Conclusion: 该方法在去雨任务中表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

Conclusion: 四模态框架显著优于三模态版本，展示了多模态运动检索在运动获取中的潜力。

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击通常在高频段嵌入扰动，容易被防御方法过滤。AGD旨在通过全频谱噪声嵌入对抗信号，提高攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用对抗引导的扩散（AGD）方法，将目标语义注入噪声而非直接修改图像，利用扩散模型的全频谱特性增强攻击效果。

Result: 实验表明，AGD在攻击效果和对防御的鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGD通过噪声嵌入对抗信号，有效规避防御，为对抗攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品晶体团聚现象影响产品质量，但手动标注2D显微图像中的团聚因水的透明性和视角限制而困难。

Method: 首先提出基线模型生成分割伪标签，再训练同时执行分割的实例分类模型，结合两者优势，并加入后处理模块保留晶体特性。

Result: 相比现有方法，提高了团聚分类的准确性和尺寸分布预测。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同置信度下成功分类潜在团聚实例，解决了手动标注的变异性问题。

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路损伤检测对交通安全和基础设施维护至关重要，但现有深度学习方法在多尺度特征提取和计算效率方面存在不足。

Method: 设计了双向多尺度空间金字塔池化模块（BMS-SPPF）以增强多尺度特征提取，并采用分层通道压缩策略降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在RDD2022_China_Drone数据集上，YOLO-ROC的mAP50达到67.6%，优于基线模型YOLOv8n 2.11%，小目标检测性能提升16.8%，模型大小仅2.0 MB。

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC在精度和效率上均表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督少样本类增量学习（Semi-FSCIL）方法假设未标记数据仅来自当前会话的新类，与实际场景不符。为此，论文重新定义了GSemi-FSCIL，以更贴近现实。

Method: 提出Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration（ALDC）策略，动态利用基类样本校正少样本新类的特征分布偏差。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，ALDC优于现有方法，达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: GSemi-FSCIL和ALDC策略有效解决了未标记数据来源多样化的挑战，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: RL-QR为RAG系统提供了一种可扩展且无需标注的查询优化方案，但在语义检索领域仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的时间序列评估指标TGSI和训练损失函数SATL，以更好地捕捉时间序列的几何结构，实验证明其优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值指标（如MSE）无法评估时间序列的几何结构，而几何结构对理解时间动态至关重要。

Method: 提出TGSI指标将时间序列转化为图像以评估几何结构，并设计SATL损失函数（包含一阶差分损失、频域损失和感知特征损失）以增强结构建模。

Result: 实验表明，使用SATL训练的模型在MSE和TGSI指标上均优于基线方法，且推理时无额外计算成本。

Conclusion: TGSI和SATL有效提升了时间序列预测的几何结构建模能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用预设阈值生成伪标签，忽略了不同类别分数分布的差异，导致伪标签不准确，影响模型性能。

Method: 引入SATL算法，动态计算每类正负样本的分数分布，并基于此学习类别特定阈值；同时采用差分排序损失增强阈值区分度。

Result: 在Microsoft COCO和VG-200等大规模数据集上，SATL显著提升了部分标签场景下的性能。

Conclusion: SATL通过动态学习和类别特定阈值，有效解决了多标签图像识别中部分标签的挑战，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散变换器依赖预训练的VAE压缩潜在空间，导致累积错误和解码伪影，而现有解决方案又引入了复杂的级联流程和增加的标记复杂性。

Method: 使用神经场建模解码，提出PixelNerd框架，实现高效的单尺度和单阶段训练。

Result: 在ImageNet上直接达到2.15 FID（256×256）和2.84 FID（512×512），并在文本生成图像任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: PixelNerd提供了一种高效且无需复杂级联或VAE的解决方案，在图像生成任务中表现突出。

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

*Solha Kang,Eugene Kim,Joris Vankerschaver,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何利用Segment Anything Model 2（SAM2）进行低成本、最小输入的3D乳腺MRI肿瘤分割，发现中心向外传播策略效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺MRI的人工解读耗时且主观，商业AI工具在低收入国家因成本高难以普及，需寻找低成本替代方案。

Method: 使用单个边界框标注，通过三种切片追踪策略（从上到下、从下到上、中心向外）在3D体积中传播分割预测。

Result: 中心向外传播策略表现最一致且准确，SAM2在零样本情况下表现良好，但存在与肿瘤大小、位置和形状相关的失败模式。

Conclusion: 通用基础模型如SAM2可在最小监督下支持3D医学图像分析，为资源有限环境提供可行替代方案。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: iLRM是一种迭代式大规模3D重建模型，通过解耦场景表示、两阶段注意力机制和高分辨率信息注入，显著提升了重建质量和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于transformer的方法因计算成本高而难以扩展，iLRM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用迭代细化机制，结合解耦表示、两阶段注意力和高分辨率信息注入。

Result: 在RE10K和DL3DV数据集上表现优于现有方法，重建质量和速度均有提升。

Conclusion: iLRM通过高效利用多视图输入，实现了高质量且可扩展的3D重建。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

TL;DR: UniLIP扩展了CLIP的能力，通过两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略，实现了图像重建、生成和编辑的统一，同时保持了原始理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP统一方法在重建和生成任务中需要额外解码器或量化，导致性能下降的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略，结合双条件架构连接MLLM和扩散变换器。

Result: 在生成和编辑任务中表现优异，超越同类统一模型。

Conclusion: UniLIP扩展了CLIP的应用范围，使其在理解和生成任务中均具备竞争力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

Motivation: 研究轻量级卷积和基于Transformer的模型在资源受限应用（如嵌入式系统和边缘设备）中的实时图像分类性能。

Method: 在一致的训练设置下，对七种模型进行训练，并通过消融研究分析关键超参数（如学习率、批量大小、输入分辨率等）的影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建适用于实时图像处理的高效深度学习模型提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

TL;DR: BLiM框架通过双向似然估计和候选先验归一化（CPN）解决文本-视频检索中的候选先验偏差问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在应用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）时，因候选似然引入先验偏差，导致检索结果偏向高先验而非高相关性的候选。

Method: 提出BLiM框架，结合双向似然估计（文本生成视频特征和视频生成文本）和训练无关的CPN模块，校准分数以减少偏差。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，BLiM+CPN平均R@1提升6.4%，有效缓解偏差并增强查询-候选相关性。

Conclusion: BLiM和CPN不仅提升检索性能，还适用于其他多模态任务，减少对文本先验的依赖。

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

TL;DR: FastDriveVLA是一种基于重建的视觉令牌剪枝框架，专为自动驾驶设计，通过保留前景信息提升决策效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉令牌剪枝方法在自动驾驶场景中表现不佳，而人类驾驶员主要关注前景区域，因此保留含前景信息的视觉令牌对决策至关重要。

Method: 提出FastDriveVLA框架，包含ReconPruner剪枝器，通过MAE风格像素重建和对抗性前景-背景重建策略训练，无需重新训练即可应用于不同VLA模型。

Result: 在nuScenes闭环规划基准测试中，不同剪枝比例下均取得最优结果。

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA通过前景信息保留显著提升自动驾驶场景下的视觉令牌剪枝效果。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标（如IoU和mAP）无法有效检测文档布局分析中的结构性错误（如区域合并、分割和内容缺失）。

Method: 提出LED基准，包含错误存在检测、错误类型分类和元素级错误类型分类三项任务，并构建合成数据集LED-Dataset。

Result: 实验表明，LED能有效区分不同模型的结构理解能力，揭示传统指标无法发现的模态偏差和性能权衡。

Conclusion: LED为文档布局分析提供了更全面的评估框架，有助于改进模型的结构鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

*Wei Li,Xun Gong,Jiao Li,Xiaobin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为自适应分组对齐（AGA）的新框架，用于从医学图像和报告中捕获结构化语义，解决了现有方法忽略报告结构和依赖大量负样本的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学领域的视觉-语言预训练方法通常将临床报告简化为单一实体或碎片化标记，忽略了其固有结构，且对比学习框架依赖大量负样本，这在小型医学数据集中不实用。

Method: AGA通过双向分组机制和稀疏相似性矩阵，动态学习分组阈值，计算细粒度相似性，并使用实例感知组对齐损失和双向跨模态分组对齐模块增强对齐。

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上的实验表明，AGA在图像-文本检索和分类任务中表现出色，适用于微调和零样本设置。

Conclusion: AGA通过自适应分组和对齐机制，有效解决了医学视觉表示学习中的结构化和负样本依赖问题，取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 解决现有扩散方法在复杂或大范围变换时难以保持场景一致性的问题。

Method: 采用训练无关的扩散方法FreeFine，分步处理对象变换、修复和细化。

Result: 在GeoBench基准测试中，FreeFine在图像保真度和编辑精度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeFine为几何图像编辑提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of

machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray

Motivation: 现有基于教师-学生框架的半监督伪装目标检测方法存在预测偏差和计算开销大的问题，ST-SAM旨在通过简洁的框架解决这些限制。

Method: ST-SAM采用自训练策略，动态筛选和扩展高置信度伪标签，并利用Segment Anything Model的潜力，避免多网络架构的复杂性。

Result: 在仅使用1%标注数据的情况下，ST-SAM在COD基准数据集上达到最先进性能，甚至媲美全监督方法。

Conclusion: ST-SAM为高效标注的半监督伪装目标检测提供了新范式，仅需训练单一网络，且不依赖特定模型或损失函数。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

Motivation: 联邦学习在分类任务中已取得成功，但在非分类任务（如人体姿态估计）中因分辨率漂移问题性能显著下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出分辨率自适应联邦学习（RAF），利用基于热图的多分辨率知识蒸馏，通过高分辨率输出（教师）与低分辨率输出（学生）之间的交互增强分辨率鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RAF不仅适用于人体姿态估计，其通用性还支持其他依赖空间细节的任务，揭示了分类任务与高分辨率表示任务之间的差异。

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

Result: 在大规模数据集上验证，显著提升感知准确性，尤其在挑战性条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: PriorFusion通过整合多类先验，生成更准确、规则且连贯的道路元素预测。

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Result: 发现ConvNext和EVA模型与其他模型在集中度上差异显著，且误分类图像需要更大的像素集。

Conclusion: 最小充分像素集是理解模型决策过程的有效工具，不同架构模型的集中度差异为模型选择提供了新视角。

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

Motivation: 传统视觉关系检测模型泛化能力有限，难以处理新或复杂关系，而指令调优提供了更有效的解决方案。

Method: 将视觉关系检测数据集转换为指令调优格式，采用自适应采样算法，优化模型对信息丰富关系的关注。

Result: ART在多个数据集上显著优于基线方法，并能推理未见过的关系概念。

Conclusion: ART不仅提升了关系检测性能，还能用于复杂场景分割，展示了实际应用价值。

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

<details>

Motivation: 研究动机是理解扩散模型在没有明确指导的情况下如何内部表示内容和风格概念。

Method: 方法包括利用交叉注意力热图将生成图像的像素归因于特定提示词，从而分离内容和风格描述词影响的区域。

Result: 结果显示，内容词主要影响对象相关区域，而风格词影响背景和纹理区域，表明模型对内容-风格区分有自发理解。

Conclusion: 结论是扩散模型在没有明确监督的情况下能够内部表示复杂的艺术概念，研究提供了代码和工具以可视化注意力图。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前少样本分类和分割方法在小物体上表现不佳，且评估设置未充分利用昂贵标注数据。

Method: EMAT引入内存高效掩码注意力机制、可学习降采样策略和参数效率增强。

Result: 在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上表现优于所有现有方法，参数减少四倍。

Conclusion: EMAT显著提升小物体处理能力，并提出了更实用的评估设置。

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出FlowGaussian-VR，一种基于流增强速度场建模的3D高斯视频重建方法，解决了复杂运动和尺度变化下的视觉质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真3D视频重建对VR/AR至关重要，但现有方法在复杂运动和尺度变化下表现不佳，导致视觉质量下降。

Method: FlowGaussian-VR包含两个核心组件：基于光流优化的速度场渲染（VFR）管道和流辅助自适应稠密化（FAD）策略。

Result: 在多视角动态重建和新视图合成任务中，模型在PSNR上提升了2.5 dB以上，减少了动态纹理的模糊伪影，并规范化了高斯轨迹。

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR在复杂运动场景中显著提升了视频重建的视觉质量和轨迹跟踪能力。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Motivation: 当前端到端grounding模型在挑战性基准测试中准确率不足65%，远未达到部署要求，需改进训练方法。

Method: 通过实证研究，从数据收集到模型训练优化细节，开发了Phi-Ground模型家族。

Conclusion: 论文提出的训练细节和Phi-Ground模型不仅改进了grounding任务，也对其他感知任务有借鉴意义。

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other
perception tasks. Project homepage:

Motivation: 现有车道拓扑推理方法在利用时间信息提升检测和推理性能方面表现不足，且易受姿态估计失败影响。

Method: 提出FASTopoWM框架，结合历史和新初始化查询的并行监督，并引入潜在查询和BEV世界模型以传播状态表示。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2基准测试中，车道段检测（37.4% mAP）和中心线感知（46.3% OLS）性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FASTopoWM通过改进时间感知和减少姿态估计依赖，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

Motivation: 尽管CBMs在可解释性方面表现良好，但在分布偏移下难以可靠识别正确概念，因此需要更严格的评估方法。

Method: 通过SUB数据集（基于CUB数据集生成的38,400张合成图像）和TDG方法（通过共享噪声控制生成图像），评估CBMs的鲁棒性。

Result: SUB数据集和TDG方法为CBMs的评估提供了新工具，有助于开发更鲁棒的可解释模型。

Conclusion: SUB和TDG为概念模型的鲁棒性评估提供了重要贡献，推动了可解释AI的发展。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床中至关重要，但领域偏移导致模型性能下降，限制了实际应用。

Result: 在两个公共多中心基准测试中表现优于现有领域泛化方法，实现了跨领域的稳健分割性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过特征扰动和一致性约束，显著提升了医学图像分割的领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

Motivation: 交通标志识别是自动驾驶感知系统的核心，但现有技术面临长尾分布和小目标多尺度两大挑战，影响识别性能。

Method: 提出NanoVerse YOLO模型（含RepVL-PAN和SPD-Conv模块）用于检测，以及TSR-MCL模型（基于视觉-语义对比学习）用于分类。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂开放场景中表现出优异的准确性和泛化能力，有效解决了数据不平衡和特征提取问题。

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

Result: 在城市规模数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉一致性和几何保真度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂城市环境中实现了鲁棒且高质量的道路表面重建。

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Conclusion: THQA-10K数据集和提出的评估方法为AGTH质量研究提供了重要工具，揭示了现有AGTHs的失真问题。

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

Conclusion: 计算机视觉领域的设计模式不断演进，从深度网络到注意力机制和自监督学习，推动了图像识别和生成技术的发展。

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Short-LVLM框架，通过利用重要视觉语言（VL）令牌和减少层间特征差距，解决了大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）层剪枝的挑战，实现了性能与效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）因参数庞大和计算成本高而应用受限，现有自然语言处理（NLP）的层剪枝方法在LVLM中效果不佳。

Method: 提出Short-LVLM（SVL）框架，通过筛选重要VL令牌和减少层间特征差距，实现训练无关、模型无关且兼容性高的层剪枝。

Result: Short-LVLM在性能与效率间取得优越平衡，并具备训练无关、模型无关和高兼容性等优势。

Conclusion: Short-LVLM为LVLM的层剪枝提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的特征匹配方法依赖Transformer的注意力机制，计算成本高。Mamba的线性复杂度提供了效率优势，但需要结合Transformer以保持性能。

Method: 提出VMatcher，混合Mamba的选择性状态空间模型（SSM）和Transformer的注意力机制，采用分层架构。

Result: VMatcher在效率和性能上均表现优异，为实时应用提供了快速推理能力。

Conclusion: VMatcher通过混合架构在特征匹配中实现了高效与高性能的平衡，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

Motivation: 情感理解与生成任务通常分开处理，但它们是互补的，可以相互增强。本文旨在通过统一框架解决这一问题。

Method: 提出层次化情感理解链提取多尺度情感特征，并融合专家查询与情感表示指导扩散模型生成情感图像。引入情感相关系数和条件损失增强生成多样性。

Result: 实验表明UniEmo在情感理解与生成任务上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniEmo通过双向反馈机制提升了模型的情感理解能力，同时实现了高质量的情感图像生成。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种渐进式对齐策略MP^2A，用于改进CLIP模型在无监督域适应中的性能，通过逐步引入高置信度样本减少噪声影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无监督域适应中一次性对齐所有伪标签数据，容易受到噪声和难分类样本的影响，导致误差传播和次优特征学习。

Method: 提出MP^2A方法，先从高置信度目标样本开始训练，逐步引入更具挑战性的样本，以减少初始标签噪声的影响。

Result: 在ImageCLEF、Office-Home和DomainNet三个基准测试中，MP^2A表现优于现有CLIP-based MS-UDA方法。

Conclusion: 渐进式对齐策略能有效减少确认偏差，提升模型鲁棒性，学习到真正的域不变特征。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 解决3DGS对高斯初始化敏感、空间感知有限和缺乏高斯间关联的问题。

Method: 通过共享3D空间信息对齐NeRF和3DGS的空间特征，优化残差向量增强3DGS能力。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: NeRF和3DGS互补，为高效3D场景表示提供新思路。

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Stein分数的去噪扩散模型（SBDDM）的无监督OOD检测方法，显著提高了检测效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有生成方法在计算成本、可靠性和适应性上的不足，特别是在医学影像中低发病率病理案例的检测。

Method: 利用SBDDM的前向扩散轨迹，通过Stein分数捕捉轨迹曲率，仅需五步扩散即可实现异常评分。

Result: 在Near-OOD和Far-OOD检测中分别相对提升10.43%和18.10%，计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: SBDDM是一种高效、可靠的实时计算机辅助诊断工具。

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该系统可作为化学检测方法的有效替代方案。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

Motivation: 艺术风格分类因缺乏专家标注数据集和风格元素间复杂的非线性关系而具有挑战性。现有双教师自监督框架的线性投影层和局部关注难以建模全局构图和复杂风格特征交互。

Method: 改进双教师知识蒸馏框架，用KANs替代MLP投影和预测头，利用其基于样条的激活函数精确建模非线性特征相关性。

Result: 在WikiArt和Pandora18k数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Top-1准确率上优于基础双教师架构，且KANs在解耦复杂风格流形方面表现更优。

Conclusion: KANs能有效建模非线性特征交互，提升艺术风格分类性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

Result: 在两个HSI基准数据集上的实验表明，HyCASS优于现有基于学习的压缩模型，并提供了不同压缩比下的优化指南。

Conclusion: HyCASS为HSI压缩提供了有效的可调整解决方案，并建立了光谱和空间压缩平衡的实用指南。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Method: 提出了CST Anti-UAV数据集，包含220个视频序列和24万个高质量标注框，并首次引入完整的手动帧级属性标注。

Result: 在CST Anti-UAV数据集上评估了20种现有SOT方法，最优方法仅达到35.92%的准确率，远低于其他数据集。

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV的发布将促进更鲁棒的SOT方法发展，并推动抗无人机系统的创新。

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data

propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters

Conclusion: Stable-Sim2Real为3D数据模拟提供了一种高效的数据驱动方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于双路径循环对齐框架的双曲循环对齐网络（Hy-CycleAlign），用于解决跨模态图像配准问题，并通过双曲层次对比对齐模块（H²CA）提升配准效果。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于欧几里得空间的配准方法难以有效处理跨模态图像的对齐问题，导致配准和融合质量不佳。

Method: 提出Hy-CycleAlign，采用双路径循环配准框架和H²CA模块，将图像映射到双曲空间以减少模态差异干扰。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在跨模态图像对齐和融合任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 双曲空间能更敏感且有效地实现多模态图像配准，Hy-CycleAlign为跨模态图像处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

Conclusion: GSFFs为视觉定位提供了一种高效且隐私保护的新方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

Conclusion: BeyondGloss框架有效提升了手语翻译性能，代码将公开。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Motivation: 传统手动校准方法耗时费力且可能需封路，亟需自动化解决方案。

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib在V2X场景下实现了更优且稳定的校准性能，参数更少。

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

Conclusion: MoGA通过结合生成模型和3D约束，成功实现了高保真3D化身重建，并展示了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在3D占用预测中常牺牲实时性以追求高精度，而自动驾驶系统需要同时满足两者。

Method: 通过切片3D体素特征保留垂直几何信息，结合方向性注意力机制提取多方向几何特征。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes上达到39.3% mIoU和27.7 FPS，边缘设备上14.8 FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度与效率间取得平衡，适用于资源受限的实时自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时空频率运动感知的视觉伪装Mamba（Vcamba），通过整合频率和空间特征，提高了视频伪装物体检测的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖空间外观特征，但前景与背景的高相似性限制了检测效果。频率特征和Mamba模型的长序列建模能力为改进提供了可能。

Method: 设计了RFVSS模块提取多尺度空间特征，AFE模块增强频率学习，SLMP和FLMP模块分别建模时空和频率时序序列，SFMF模块整合双域特征。

Result: 在2个数据集上的6项评价指标中表现优于现有方法，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Vcamba通过整合空间和频率特征，显著提升了视频伪装物体检测的性能。

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

Motivation: 确保医疗图像共享时保护患者隐私（PHI/PII），同时保留非隐私元数据以支持AI研究。

Method: 采用三阶段挑战（训练、验证、测试），使用含合成PHI/PII的真实DICOM图像，评估多种去标识工具和方法。

Result: 10支团队完成测试，准确率在97.91%到99.93%之间。

Conclusion: MIDI-B挑战展示了规则化去标识方法的可行性，为未来研究提供了宝贵经验。

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像到图像生成中存在泛化能力差和适应成本高的问题，需要一种更高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: DivControl通过SVD分解ControlNet，利用动态门进行知识转移，并引入表示对齐损失提升条件保真度和训练效率。

Conclusion: DivControl展示了卓越的可扩展性、模块化和迁移能力，为统一可控生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Conclusion: 该方法为SNNs提供了一种高效、低复杂度的训练方案，适用于边缘设备。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

Motivation: 现有预训练模型在迁移到时间动态不同的新数据集时性能下降，需微调，限制了其可扩展性和实用性。

Method: 提出OmniTraj，基于Transformer，通过显式条件化帧率等时间元数据，预训练于大规模异构数据集。

Result: OmniTraj在零样本迁移中减少预测误差超70%，微调后在四个数据集上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 显式条件化时间元数据是解决时间动态迁移问题的有效方法，OmniTraj展示了其优越性。

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical
imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and
hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a
neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative
porcine hyperspectral dataset. Experimental results demonstrate SAMSA's
effectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal
training examples. Our approach enables seamless integration of datasets with
different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for
hyperspectral medical image analysis.

TL;DR: I2V-GS是一种基于高斯散射的框架，将基础设施视图转换为车辆视图，用于生成自动驾驶数据，显著提升了合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶数据主要依赖车辆采集，成本高且效率低，而通过合成数据可以解决这一问题。

Method: 采用自适应深度扭曲生成密集训练视图，结合级联策略修复扭曲图像，并利用跨视图信息进行置信度优化。

Result: I2V-GS在NTA-Iou、NTL-Iou和FID指标上分别提升了45.7%、34.2%和14.9%，优于StreetGaussian。

Conclusion: I2V-GS是首个实现基础设施-车辆视图转换的框架，为自动驾驶数据生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has emerged as a promising yet
challenging research direction. To address its core challenges, we propose a
novel unified image restoration framework based on latent diffusion models
(LDMs). Our approach structurally integrates low-quality visual priors into the
diffusion process, unlocking the powerful generative capacity of diffusion
models for diverse degradations. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware
Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to enable adaptive handling of diverse degradation
types. Furthermore, to mitigate detail loss caused by the high compression and
iterative sampling of LDMs, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in
the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive
experiments across multi-task and mixed degradation settings demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code
will be released.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code

Motivation: 解决Slot Attention中冗余槽竞争和信息监督不足的问题。

Method: 引入槽重新初始化和自蒸馏机制，优化注意力图。

Result: 在对象发现和识别等任务上达到SOTA，并提升视觉预测和推理能力。

Conclusion: DIAS有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了性能。

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

Motivation: 现有基于3D高斯泼溅的方法局限于单对象、单步交互，无法满足复杂现实任务的需求。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在SeqAffordSplat基准上取得了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将功能区域推理从单步扩展到复杂场景中的长时程任务。

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

Motivation: 现有3D人体模型（如SMPL-X）缺乏物理交互能力，导致交互模型存在穿透和不真实动态问题。

Method: 采用“半物理”机制，将3D运动转换为物理模拟，保持对SMPL-X姿态的动力学控制，同时实现物理交互。

Result: 方法无需学习，实时运行，适用于任意体型和动作，且保持原始运动保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有模型的物理交互问题，提升了交互的真实性和实用性。

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

Motivation: 传统方法依赖密集多视角捕捉（如数百个校准相机），成本高昂且难以应用于多样化场景。本文旨在从少量稀疏视角相机重建动态场景。

Method: 通过独立单目重建的精心对齐，生成时间和视角一致的动态场景重建。

Result: 在PanopticStudio和Ego-Exo4D数据集上，该方法优于现有技术，尤其在渲染新视角时表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法为稀疏视角动态场景重建提供了高效解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

Conclusion: 该框架为生成高质量动画3D内容开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful

Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在推理能力提升与偏见缓解之间的平衡关系。

Method: 比较三种偏见缓解策略（SFT、KD、RL），并通过调整样本比例分析推理与偏见的权衡。

Result: 强化学习训练的1:4混合样本比例效果最佳，偏见降低10%，推理准确性保留88%。

Conclusion: 为平衡MLLMs的公平性与能力提供了具体指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness

Conclusion: 需整合选择性注意力、基于物理的音频理解和上下文感知的新方法，以缩小人机听觉差距。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

### [103] [Argumentatively Coherent Judgmental Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23163)
*Deniz Gorur,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

TL;DR: 论文探讨了判断性预测中的论证连贯性，提出并验证了连贯性对提高预测准确性的作用，同时发现用户并未普遍遵循这一特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究判断性预测中论证连贯性的重要性，以提升预测准确性。

Method: 提出论证连贯性的正式定义，并通过人类和LLM预测者评估其影响，同时进行用户实验。

Result: 过滤不连贯预测显著提高了准确性，但用户未普遍遵循连贯性。

Conclusion: 论证连贯性对预测准确性有实际价值，需在群体预测中整合机制过滤不连贯意见。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化查询答案中事实的贡献是重要问题，但现有方法在基于本体的查询回答中的复杂性尚未充分研究。

Method: 利用数据库设置的结果，分析WSMS在不同查询类别和本体语言中的计算复杂性。

Result: 对于可一阶重写的查询类别，WSMS具有多项式数据复杂度；而在某些情况下（如支持可达性查询的本体语言），问题变得困难。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了WSMS计算的复杂性边界，并为DL-Lite方言中的特定查询类别提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分治策略的混合MILP方法，通过新型的ReLU评分机制（SAS）显著减少二进制变量数量，提升验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决复杂实例验证中的效率问题，作者重新审视了分治策略，旨在减少复杂BaB调用的需求。

Method: 提出了一种解决方案感知的ReLU评分（SAS），并改进了BaB-SR和BaB-FSB分支函数作为全局ReLU评分（GS）。通过混合MILP方法，结合α,β-CROWN和部分MILP调用。

Result: SAS将二进制变量数量减少约6倍，同时保持相同精度。混合MILP方法将未决实例数量降低至8-15%，平均运行时间为46-417秒。

Conclusion: SAS和混合MILP方法显著提升了验证效率，适用于大规模CNN模型。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25
dataset.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多样性和难度上的有效性。

Conclusion: Self-Foveate显著提升了指令合成的质量，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

Result: 新方法在Corr2Cause基准上表现显著优于传统方法，性能提升近三倍。

Conclusion: 先进推理模型结合结构化上下文框架能显著提升因果发现能力，并为跨领域应用提供通用方案。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Result: 实验表明不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性上有不同表现，算法高效且完全黑盒。

Conclusion: 因果解释兼具形式严谨性和实用性，适用于图像分类器，且计算高效。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to

we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TextQuests是一个基于交互式小说的基准测试，旨在评估AI代理在长上下文推理和自主问题解决中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能充分评估AI代理在探索性环境中的自主推理能力，需要一种更全面的评估工具。

Method: 利用Infocom的交互式小说游戏作为基准，要求代理在无外部工具的情况下进行长时间的状态化任务解决。

Result: TextQuests提供了一个评估AI代理内在长上下文推理能力的有效平台。

Conclusion: 该基准测试推动了AI代理在复杂探索性环境中自主推理能力的发展。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

TL;DR: Seed-Prover 是一种基于 Lean 反馈的定理证明模型，通过迭代优化证明，显著提升了数学推理能力，特别是在 IMO 级别的问题上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学推理中表现良好，但在定理证明上因缺乏明确的监督信号而受限。Seed-Prover 旨在通过形式化验证解决这一问题。

Method: Seed-Prover 利用 Lean 的形式化反馈、已证明的引理和自我总结，迭代优化证明。此外，设计了三种测试时推理策略以支持深度和广度推理。

Result: Seed-Prover 在 IMO 级别问题上表现优异，证明了 78.1% 的形式化 IMO 问题，并在 MiniF2F 和 PutnamBench 上大幅超越先前最佳结果。

Conclusion: Seed-Prover 和 Seed-Geometry 的结合显著提升了自动数学推理能力，展示了形式化验证与长链推理的有效性。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

TL;DR: CoT-Self-Instruct是一种合成数据生成方法，通过Chain-of-Thought引导LLMs生成高质量合成提示，显著优于现有数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升LLM训练数据的质量和复杂性，以增强模型在可验证推理和非可验证指令任务中的表现。

Method: 基于Chain-of-Thought引导LLMs生成合成提示，并通过自动指标过滤高质量数据。

Result: 在可验证推理任务中显著优于现有数据集（如s1k和OpenMathReasoning），在非可验证任务中优于人类或标准自提示方法。

Conclusion: CoT-Self-Instruct生成的合成数据在多种任务中表现优异，为LLM训练提供了更高质量的数据源。

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that
instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the
given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar
quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for
high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our
synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as
s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For
non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the
performance of human or standard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0
and Arena-Hard.

TL;DR: SimuRA是一种基于LLM的通用AI代理架构，通过世界模型模拟克服自回归推理的局限性，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理局限于单一任务，缺乏通用性和可扩展性，而人类通过模拟行动结果进行推理，SimuRA旨在实现更通用的智能代理。

Method: SimuRA引入世界模型进行规划，利用LLM的潜在语言空间灵活模拟环境，优化代理行为。

Result: 在网页浏览任务中，SimuRA将航班搜索成功率从0%提升至32.2%，世界模型规划比自回归规划优势高达124%。

Conclusion: SimuRA展示了世界模型模拟作为推理范式的优势，为训练通用LLM代理奠定了基础。

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

TL;DR: PancreasDG是一个多中心3D MRI胰腺分割数据集，旨在研究医学影像中的领域泛化问题，填补了胰腺分割在跨中心和跨序列变化研究中的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺分割在腹部影像中具有挑战性，且现有基准测试忽视了跨序列变化这一主要变异性来源。胰腺在临床早期癌症检测、手术和糖尿病研究中具有重要意义。

Method: 提出了PancreasDG数据集，包含563个MRI扫描，来自六个机构，涵盖静脉期和非同期序列，采用双盲双次协议生成像素级胰腺掩模。

Result: 研究发现：(i)有限采样引入显著方差，(ii)跨中心性能与源域性能相关，(iii)跨序列变化需专门解决方案。提出的半监督方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: PancreasDG为医学影像领域泛化设定了新基准，数据集、代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at
https://pancreasdg.netlify.app.

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.
