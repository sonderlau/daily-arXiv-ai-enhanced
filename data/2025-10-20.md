### [1] [Evaluating the Prediction of Wind Power Ramping Events in the Belgian Offshore Zone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15474)
*Ruoke Meng,Geert Smet,Dieter Van den Bleeken,Aaron Van Poecke,Hossein Tabari,Peter Hellinckx,Piet Termonia,Joris Van den Bergh*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究评估了比利时近海区域风功率爬坡事件的预测性能，比较了ALARO-4km模型及其风电场参数化版本，发现风电场参数化模型能提升爬坡预测能力，机器学习方法可减少漏报和误报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准评估指标如MAE不足以评估风功率爬坡事件，需要开发能容忍轻微误差的灵活评估框架来准确评估爬坡预测性能。

Method: 使用功率曲线和机器学习方法生成功率预测，提出包含时间和功率缓冲区的评估框架，并引入爬坡对齐评分来量化时间误差。

Result: 风电场参数化模型提升了爬坡预测技能，机器学习方法提供了更平衡的预测，严重降水是大型可预测爬坡的强指示因子，而轻微降水与较大预测误差相关。

Conclusion: 风电场参数化模型和机器学习方法能有效改进风功率爬坡预测，提出的评估框架为爬坡事件评估提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Evaluations are presented for the prediction of wind power ramping events in
the Belgian Offshore Zone. Two models from the Royal Meteorological Institute
of Belgium are verified: the operational ALARO-4km and its version with Wind
Farm Parameterization (WFP). Power predictions are produced using power curves
and machine learning (ML). As standard metrics such as MAE are insufficient for
evaluating ramps, the proposed framework incorporates time and power buffers,
enabling a flexible assessment that tolerates minor errors. Results indicate
that WFP models enhance ramping prediction skill, while ML provides more
balanced forecasts by reducing both misses and false alarms. A Ramp Alignment
Score is also introduced to quantify temporal errors by forecast lead time,
confirming that WFP models yield smaller average timing errors. Moreover, the
framework reveals that severe precipitation is a strong indicator of large,
predictable ramps, whereas lighter precipitation is associated with greater
forecast errors.

### [2] [Design and Analysis of Parallel Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (P-APO) using CUDA Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14982)
*Henish Soliya,Anugrah Jain*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于NVIDIA CUDA框架的并行化人工原生动物优化器(APO)，通过GPU加速实现了最高6.7倍的性能提升，并在基准函数和实际应用中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 元启发式算法在处理复杂问题时执行时间随问题规模和求解空间增大而显著增加，需要大量迭代次数才能获得理想结果，这是这类算法的主要瓶颈。为解决这一问题，研究人员致力于开发并行版本的优化算法。

Method: 使用NVIDIA CUDA框架实现人工原生动物优化器(APO)的并行版本，同时实现了现有的串行版本作为对比。

Result: 在CEC2022基准函数上的实验结果显示，并行版本实现了最高6.7倍的加速比。在张力/压缩弹簧设计和基于Otsu方法的图像阈值分割两个实际应用中也验证了其性能。

Conclusion: 提出的并行APO算法通过GPU加速显著提升了计算性能，能够有效处理大规模优化问题，在基准测试和实际应用中均表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are widely used for solving complex problems due to
their ability to provide near-optimal solutions. But the execution time of
these algorithms increases with the problem size and solution space. And, to
get more promising results, we have to execute these algorithms for a large
number of iterations, requiring a large amount of time and this is one of the
main issues found with these algorithms. To handle the same, researchers are
now-adays working on design and development of parallel versions of state of
the art metaheuristic optimization algorithms. We, in this paper, present a
parallel implementation of state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer using
NVIDIA CUDA framework to leverage GPU acceleration. Our implementation
optimizes the state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (APO) to achieve
high performance. We implement both the existing sequential version and the
proposed parallel version of Artificial Protozoa Optimizer in this paper. The
experimental results calculated over benchmarks functions of CEC2022
demonstrate a significant performance gain i.e. up to 6.7 times speed up
achieved in case of proposed parallel version. We also use two real world
applications (1) Tension/Compression Spring Design in engineering optimization
and (2) Image Thresholding using otsu method for testing the performance of
proposed implementation in handling real tasks.

### [3] [SpikeFit: Towards Optimal Deployment of Spiking Networks on Neuromorphic Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15542)
*Ivan Kartashov,Mariia Pushkareva,Iakov Karandashev*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: SpikeFit是一种新的SNN训练方法，通过联合优化离散权重值和模型参数，实现高效的神经形态硬件部署，支持低精度（2/4/8位）和有限连接数约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统压缩方法仅解决部分神经形态硬件要求（有限数值精度和神经元数量），无法全面满足硬件约束，包括权重离散值、连接数限制等。

Method: 将允许的权重离散值作为可学习参数与模型共同优化，实现聚类感知训练；引入硬件友好的Fisher Spike Contribution剪枝方法。

Result: 在仅允许4个唯一突触权重值的情况下，SpikeFit优于现有SNN压缩方法和传统基线，满足更广泛的硬件要求且能耗最低。

Conclusion: SpikeFit通过联合优化找到符合硬件约束的离散权重集，在神经形态处理器上实现最完整的部署，提供最先进的压缩性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces SpikeFit, a novel training method for Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) that enables efficient inference on neuromorphic hardware,
considering all its stringent requirements: the number of neurons and synapses
that can fit on a single device, and lower bit-width representations (e.g.,
4-bit, 8-bit). Unlike conventional compressing approaches that address only a
subset of these requirements (limited numerical precision and limited number of
neurons in the network), SpikeFit treats the allowed weights' discrete values
themselves as learnable parameters co-optimized with the model, allowing for
optimal Clusterization-Aware Training (CAT) of the model's weights at low
precision (2-, 4-, or 8-bit) which results in higher network compression
efficiency, as well as limiting the number of unique synaptic connections to a
value required by neuromorphic processor. This joint optimization allows
SpikeFit to find a discrete weight set aligned with hardware constraints,
enabling the most complete deployment across a broader range of neuromorphic
processors than existing methods of SNN compression support. Moreover, SpikeFit
introduces a new hardware-friendly Fisher Spike Contribution (FSC) pruning
method showing the state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate that for
spiking neural networks constrained to only four unique synaptic weight values
(M = 4), our SpikeFit method not only outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs
compression methods and conventional baselines combining extreme quantization
schemes and clustering algorithms, but also meets a wider range of neuromorphic
hardware requirements and provides the lowest energy use in experiments.

### [4] [GAZE:Governance-Aware pre-annotation for Zero-shot World Model Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14992)
*Leela Krishna,Mengyang Zhao,Saicharithreddy Pasula,Harshit Rajgarhia,Abhishek Mukherji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAZE pipeline自动将原始长视频转换为世界模型训练所需的多模态标注数据，通过AI模型预标注和结构化输出，显著提升标注效率并减少人工审核量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工标注大规模多模态数据集成本高、速度慢，阻碍了鲁棒世界模型的训练。需要自动化解决方案来加速高质量训练数据的生成。

Method: 采用三步流程：1) 标准化360度视频格式并分片处理；2) 应用多种AI模型进行密集多模态预标注；3) 整合信号为结构化输出供人工验证。

Result: 效率提升显著（每审核小时节省约19分钟），人工审核量减少80%以上，通过保守跳过低显著性片段实现。生成高保真、隐私感知的数据集。

Conclusion: GAZE工作流为生成高质量世界模型训练数据提供了可扩展的蓝图，在不牺牲吞吐量或治理的前提下实现高效数据生成。

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

### [5] [PC-UNet: An Enforcing Poisson Statistics U-Net for Positron Emission Tomography Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14995)
*Yang Shi,Jingchao Wang,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Ruixin He,Yifeng Xie,Hanqian Liu,Minzhe Guo,Yangyang Liang,Weipeng Zhang,Zimeng Li,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PC-UNet模型和PVMC-Loss损失函数，通过整合物理数据来改善低剂量PET图像的降噪效果，提高图像保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET临床应用中降低辐射剂量会增加泊松噪声，现有降噪方法无法有效处理，导致图像失真和伪影。

Method: 开发Poisson Consistent U-Net模型，引入新的Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss损失函数，该损失函数在方差和梯度自适应方面具有统计无偏性。

Result: 在PET数据集上的测试表明，PC-UNet提高了物理一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: PC-UNet能够有效整合物理信息，为低剂量PET成像提供更好的降噪解决方案。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

### [6] [DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)
*Mor Ventura,Michael Toker,Or Patashnik,Yonatan Belinkov,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLeaker是一种轻量级、无需优化的推理时方法，通过直接干预模型的注意力图来缓解文本到图像模型中的语义泄漏问题，无需外部输入即可有效抑制跨实体交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型存在语义泄漏问题，即不同实体之间意外传递语义相关特征，现有缓解策略通常基于优化或依赖外部输入。

Method: 在扩散过程中动态重新加权注意力图，抑制过度的跨实体交互，同时增强每个实体的身份特征。

Result: DeLeaker在所有基线方法中表现最佳，即使基线方法使用外部信息，也能在不影响保真度或质量的情况下有效缓解泄漏。

Conclusion: 注意力控制对于实现更精确语义的文本到图像模型具有重要价值。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

### [7] [UrbanVerse: Scaling Urban Simulation by Watching City-Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15018)
*Mingxuan Liu,Honglin He,Elisa Ricci,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanVerse是一个数据驱动的真实到仿真系统，可将众包城市游览视频转换为物理感知的交互式仿真场景，包含10万+标注的3D城市资产库和自动生成管线，在导航任务中展现出强大的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手工制作或程序生成的仿真场景缺乏可扩展性或无法捕捉真实世界的复杂性，而城市嵌入式AI代理需要多样化的高保真城市环境进行训练。

Method: UrbanVerse包含UrbanVerse-100K（10万+标注城市3D资产库）和UrbanVerse-Gen（从视频提取场景布局并使用检索资产实例化度量尺度3D仿真的自动管线），在IsaacSim中运行。

Result: UrbanVerse场景保留了真实世界的语义和布局，在人类评估的真实感方面与手工制作场景相当。在导航任务中，训练策略展现出缩放幂律和强泛化能力，仿真成功率提高6.3%，零样本仿真到真实转移成功率提高30.1%。

Conclusion: UrbanVerse通过数据驱动方法成功创建了高质量的城市仿真环境，显著提升了城市导航代理的训练效果和现实世界部署性能。

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

### [8] [NANO3D: A Training-Free Approach for Efficient 3D Editing Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15019)
*Junliang Ye,Shenghao Xie,Ruowen Zhao,Zhengyi Wang,Hongyu Yan,Wenqiang Zu,Lei Ma,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nano3D是一个无需训练的3D物体编辑框架，通过FlowEdit和TRELLIS集成实现局部编辑，并引入区域感知合并策略Voxel/Slat-Merge来保持结构保真度，同时构建了首个大规模3D编辑数据集Nano3D-Edit-100k。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D物体编辑方法效率低下、不一致，且难以保持未编辑区域，大多数方法依赖多视角渲染编辑后进行重建，这会引入伪影并限制实用性。

Method: 将FlowEdit集成到TRELLIS中，通过前视图渲染引导进行局部编辑，并引入区域感知合并策略Voxel/Slat-Merge，自适应地保持编辑区域与未编辑区域之间的一致性。

Result: 实验表明Nano3D在3D一致性和视觉质量方面优于现有方法，同时构建了包含超过10万高质量3D编辑对的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: 该工作解决了算法设计和数据可用性方面的长期挑战，显著提高了3D编辑的通用性和可靠性，为前馈式3D编辑模型的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming,
animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient,
inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on
editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces
artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose
Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing
without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized
edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware
merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural
fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments
demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality
compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first
large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000
high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in
both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the
generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the
development of feed-forward 3D editing models. Project

*Jiaxin Ge,Grace Luo,Heekyung Lee,Nishant Malpani,Long Lian,XuDong Wang,Aleksander Holynski,Trevor Darrell,Sewon Min,David M. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ECHO框架，通过社交媒体收集真实用户提示和反馈来构建图像生成基准测试，发现了现有基准中缺失的复杂任务，并能更好地区分最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往滞后于图像生成模型的快速发展，无法捕捉新兴用例，导致社区认知与正式评估之间存在差距。

Method: 开发ECHO框架，从社交媒体帖子中收集真实用户提示和定性判断，构建包含31,000多个提示的数据集来评估GPT-4o Image Gen等模型。

Result: ECHO发现了现有基准中缺失的创意复杂任务，能更清晰地区分最先进模型，并通过社区反馈为模型质量指标设计提供信息。

Conclusion: ECHO框架通过真实世界证据构建基准测试，能够更好地反映图像生成模型的实际能力和用户需求，填补了现有评估体系的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like
GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users
interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to
capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions
of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a
framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of
model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user
judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset
of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO
(1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such
as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with
specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from
alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the
design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color,
identity, and structure). Our website is at https://echo-bench.github.io.

### [10] [BiomedXPro: Prompt Optimization for Explainable Diagnosis with Biomedical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15866)
*Kaushitha Silva,Mansitha Eashwara,Sanduni Ubayasiri,Ruwan Tennakoon,Damayanthi Herath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiomedXPro是一个进化框架，利用大型语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，自动生成多样化的可解释自然语言提示对用于疾病诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物医学视觉语言模型的临床应用受到提示优化技术的限制，这些技术要么产生不可解释的潜在向量，要么产生单一文本提示，缺乏透明度且无法捕捉临床诊断的多方面特性。

Method: 使用大型语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，通过进化框架自动生成多样化的可解释自然语言提示对。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中，BiomedXPro始终优于最先进的提示调优方法，特别是在数据稀缺的少样本设置中表现突出。

Conclusion: BiomedXPro通过生成多样化的可解释提示集合，为模型预测提供了可验证的基础，是开发更可信赖和临床对齐AI系统的重要一步。

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent
vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to
capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on
integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes
settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework
that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor
and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of
interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a
diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable
basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the
development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

### [11] [LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022)
*Mert Sonmezer,Matthew Zheng,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于子模优化的方法，用于从海量LoRA适配器中选择最相关和多样化的模型，解决用户在选择和使用适配器时面临的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA模型虽然能够个性化预训练扩散模型，但平台上存在超过10万个适配器，用户难以从海量、多样化且缺乏结构化组织的适配器中导航、选择和有效使用最合适的适配器。

Method: 将LoRA模型选择任务构建为组合优化问题，并提出一种新颖的子模框架来解决这个问题。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法能够在广泛领域内生成多样化的输出。

Conclusion: 提出的子模优化方法有效解决了从大规模LoRA适配器数据库中选择相关和多样化模型的问题，并在多个领域展现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of
pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank,
factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These
models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety
of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive
retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms
like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and
effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume,
diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the
problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast
database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and
proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide
range of domains.

### [12] [MOBIUS: Big-to-Mobile Universal Instance Segmentation via Multi-modal Bottleneck Fusion and Calibrated Decoder Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15026)
*Mattia Segu,Marta Tintore Gazulla,Yongqin Xian,Luc Van Gool,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBIUS是一个用于通用实例分割的基础模型家族，通过瓶颈像素解码器、语言引导的不确定性校准损失和统一训练策略，在减少55%像素FLOPs和75%变换器解码器FLOPs的同时保持SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型计算成本高，限制了在资源受限平台上的部署。需要设计能够在保持性能的同时支持从高端加速器到移动硬件的高效边缘部署的模型。

Method: 提出瓶颈像素解码器用于高效多尺度和多模态融合；语言引导的不确定性校准损失用于自适应解码器剪枝；统一的训练策略。

Result: MOBIUS在仅需三分之一训练迭代的情况下，减少像素FLOPs达55%，变换器解码器FLOPs达75%，同时保持最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: MOBIUS为高效分割在高端计算平台和移动设备上建立了新的基准，实现了帕累托最优的向下扩展。

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for
instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot
performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high
computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first
examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge
deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family
of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for
Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from
high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference
demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale
and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for
adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy.
Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS
reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively,
while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training
iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on
both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

TL;DR: COGS框架通过分解种子问题为感知和推理要素，然后系统性地重新组合生成大量合成问答对，有效提升多模态大语言模型在缺乏标注数据的人工图像领域（如图表、文档）的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练多模态大语言模型在多样化任务上表现良好，但在标注数据难以收集的领域推理能力有限，特别是人工图像领域如图表、渲染文档等，这些领域缺乏大规模人工标注的推理数据集。

Method: 提出COGS框架：1）将每个种子问题分解为原始感知和推理要素；2）系统性地将这些要素与新图像重新组合生成大量合成问答对；3）每个生成问题都配有子问题和中间答案，支持基于要素级过程奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在图表推理任务上的实验表明，COGS显著提高了对未见问题的性能，在推理密集和组合性问题上的提升最大。使用不同种子数据的要素级混合训练在多个数据集上实现了更好的迁移效果。

Conclusion: COGS框架能够诱导出可泛化的能力而非数据集特定的过拟合，并且可以扩展到图表之外的其他领域如网页。

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments
with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized
Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a
potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated
body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen
operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable
physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the
world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from
simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing
directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors,
covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a
specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural
field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation
paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual
environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich
scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出DRIFT方法，通过梯度空间转移推理知识来增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力，避免模型合并的性能不稳定问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的推理能力落后于纯文本模型，现有方法需要大量资源进行监督微调或强化学习，而模型合并方法在不同模型家族中效果不稳定

Method: DRIFT方法预计算推理先验作为推理变体和多模态变体之间的参数空间差异，在微调过程中用其偏置梯度，实现推理知识转移

Result: 在MathVista和MathVerse等多模态推理基准测试中，DRIFT相比朴素合并和监督微调持续提升推理性能，以较低成本达到或超越资源密集型方法

Conclusion: DRIFT提供了一种轻量级且有效的方法来增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力，解决了模型合并的不稳定性问题

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their
reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts.
Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over
large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which
are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which
interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal
variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free
lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some
(e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance
degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for
Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning
knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment.
DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between
reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during
multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard
supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer.
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista
and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning
performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or
surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

Result: 婴儿日常视觉输入呈现"块状"相似性结构，包含高度相似图像簇和罕见变化图像；计算实验表明模仿这种结构能改善机器学习模型在小数据集上的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 婴儿自然视觉体验的"块状"结构可能是早期类别学习的关键，这种结构为各种学习问题提供了高效学习的原则。

Abstract: Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by
common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given.
Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer
lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large
and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in
human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited
experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies
in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object
instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we
show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure,
with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable
ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show
that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small
datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may
thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly,
offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds
of learners.

TL;DR: SaLon3R是一个结构感知的长期3D高斯泼溅重建框架，通过引入紧凑锚点基元和3D点Transformer，有效消除冗余并解决跨帧几何不一致性问题，实现高效的长序列3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯泼溅方法在处理长序列视频时存在大量冗余和几何不一致问题，需要一种能够在线处理50+视图的高效重建方法。

Method: 使用紧凑锚点基元通过可微分显著性感知高斯量化消除冗余，结合3D点Transformer优化锚点属性和显著性，实现区域自适应高斯解码。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，能够以超过10FPS的速度重建50+视图，冗余减少50%-90%，在新型视图合成和深度估计方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SaLon3R无需已知相机参数或测试时优化，通过单次前向传播有效解决伪影并修剪冗余3DGS，展示了在长期通用3D重建方面的卓越效率、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable,
on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods
often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the
scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric
inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose
SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.
To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method
capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%
redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to
eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian
quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor
attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric
inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone
to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional
geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors
by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns
spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor
attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for
geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,
our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a
single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,
demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for
long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction. Project Page:

Conclusion: TGT框架通过轨迹与文本的配对，有效提升了视频生成中对多对象外观和运动的精确控制能力。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas
standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition
of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control
signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these
methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,
offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between
individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable
objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework
that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text
descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate
these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and
global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that
produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we
annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these
components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,
pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.
Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more
accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with
prior approaches. Website: https://textgroundedtraj.github.io.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

TL;DR: FFT-MIL通过引入频域分支增强MIL方法，在WSI分类中捕获全局依赖关系，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法在WSI分类中难以捕获全局依赖关系，因为WSI尺寸巨大且补丁嵌入具有局部性，这限制了建模粗粒度结构的能力。

Method: 提出FFT-MIL框架，通过快速傅里叶变换从WSI中提取低频分量，使用FFT-Block（卷积层和Min-Max归一化）处理频域数据，并将学到的全局频域特征与空间补丁特征融合。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上评估六种最先进MIL方法，FFT-MIL平均提升macro F1分数3.51%，AUC提升1.51%，在不同架构和数据集上均表现一致改进。

Conclusion: 频域学习是捕获WSI分类中全局依赖关系的有效且高效机制，补充了空间特征，推进了基于MIL的计算病理学的可扩展性和准确性。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture
global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of
patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures
essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a
framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact
global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast
Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of
convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of
frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial
patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling
compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public
datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1
scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains
across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain
learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global
dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and
advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

Motivation: 现有基准主要评估通用跨模态问答能力，但不清楚全模态大语言模型是否真正实现了模态无关推理或存在模态特定偏差。

Method: 构建包含60,828个多选题的大规模三模态基准XModBench，涵盖五个任务族和六种模态组合，用于细粒度诊断模态无关推理、模态差异和方向不平衡。

Result: 实验显示最强模型Gemini 2.5 Pro在时空推理上准确率低于60%，存在持续模态差异（音频表现显著差于文本），以及系统性的方向不平衡（视觉作为上下文时一致性较低）。

Conclusion: 当前全模态大语言模型远未实现真正的模态无关推理，XModBench可作为评估和改进跨模态能力的基本诊断工具。

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像-文本描述数据和交错文档数据的混合预训练中，高质量数据筛选方法尚未充分探索，需要开发有效的多模态数据质量评估工具。

Method: 采用半合成方法，利用原始图像生成不同质量级别的对应文本，创建样本-评分对来训练UniFilter分类器，然后应用于DataComp和OBELICS数据集的筛选。

Result: 基于UniFilter筛选数据预训练的MLLMs在零样本推理和上下文学习能力上显著增强，经过视觉监督微调后在多个基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: UniFilter能有效筛选高质量多模态数据，提升MLLMs性能，释放了合成训练数据、模型检查点和高质量OBELICS-HQ子集供社区使用。

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to

Result: 发现明确趋势：RandomResizedCrop值0.7-0.8优于更激进或保守的设置，分布式训练提高稳定性，学习率低于5.0e-5在所有数据集上均降低性能，LC25000（结肠）数据集提供最可重复基准。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for
histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware
non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate
these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and
systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and
augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets
(PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across
runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8
outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed
training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5
consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon)
dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings
highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on
transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental
configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in
developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

Conclusion: 该框架通过更好地平衡保真度和多样性，有效增强训练数据集多样性，显著提升下游模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and
text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is
challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text
prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process
often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as
environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify
these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation
framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the
influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby
maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating
images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional
controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of
training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our
approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged
classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and
long-tail settings, respectively.

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset

targeting specific populations. We investigate this potential by examining the
demographic bias within ads for different ad topics, and the disparate level of
persuasiveness (judged by models) of ads that are identical except for
gender/race of the people portrayed. We also experiment with a technique to

TL;DR: DriveGen3D是一个新颖的框架，用于生成高质量且高度可控的动态3D驾驶场景，通过整合加速长期视频生成和大规模动态场景重建来解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶场景合成方法存在计算需求过高、仅关注视频合成而缺乏3D表示，或仅限于静态单场景重建的问题。需要填补这一方法学空白。

Method: 采用统一流水线，包含两个专门组件：FastDrive-DiT（高效视频扩散变换器，用于在文本和鸟瞰图布局指导下合成高分辨率时序一致视频）和FastRecon3D（前馈重建模块，快速构建跨时间的3D高斯表示）。

Result: 实现了实时生成长达12FPS的扩展驾驶视频（分辨率424×800）和相应的动态3D场景，在新视角合成上达到SSIM 0.811和PSNR 22.84，同时保持参数效率。

Conclusion: DriveGen3D成功整合了加速视频生成和动态3D重建，为高质量可控驾驶场景合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and
highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical
limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene
synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended
temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D
representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction.
Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term
video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through
multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline
consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video
diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis
under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a
feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian
representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together,
these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to
$424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM
of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining
parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,
yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline
models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we
achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader
clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research. Our 2025

TL;DR: QCFace提出了一种硬边距策略来解决人脸识别中可识别性表示的问题，通过解耦可识别性和身份表示，实现了更好的特征表示和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸识别系统在可识别性表示方面存在两个主要问题：软边距约束只能部分捕捉可识别性，导致质量表示较弱；特征方向和幅度的梯度重叠导致优化不稳定和表示纠缠。

Method: 引入硬边距策略QCFace，通过指导因子进行超球面规划，同时优化识别能力和明确的可识别性表示，解决梯度重叠问题。

Result: 大量实验证实QCFace不仅提供稳健且可量化的可识别性编码，还在验证和识别基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: QCFace方法有效解决了可识别性表示中的关键问题，实现了可识别性与身份表示的清晰解耦，提升了人脸识别系统的性能。

Abstract: Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly
affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification
and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
recognizability-based losses.

TL;DR: 提出首个双曲分类框架用于单正多标签学习，通过将标签表示为双曲球而非点或向量，利用几何球体交互建模丰富的标签关系，包括层次结构、共现模式和语义独立性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单正多标签学习中每个训练样本仅标注一个正标签但可能属于多个类别的挑战，现有方法缺乏对不同关系类型的显式几何定义，难以捕捉复杂标签关系和层次结构。

Method: 采用双曲几何表示标签为球体，通过球体交互建模包含、重叠和分离关系；引入温度自适应双曲球分类器和物理启发的双势阱正则化来指导球体形成有意义的配置。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，与现有方法相比具有竞争性性能和优越的可解释性；统计分析显示学习到的嵌入与实际共现模式强相关。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为不完全监督下的结构化分类提供了更鲁棒的范式，能够有效建模复杂的标签关系。

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

TL;DR: SVG是一种新型的潜在扩散模型，不使用变分自编码器，而是利用自监督表示进行视觉生成，通过构建具有清晰语义区分性的特征空间来提高训练效率和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的VAE+扩散范式存在训练效率低、推理速度慢、对其他视觉任务迁移性差等问题，主要原因是VAE潜在空间缺乏清晰的语义分离和强判别结构。

Method: SVG利用冻结的DINO特征构建具有语义区分性的特征空间，同时使用轻量级残差分支捕捉细粒度细节以实现高保真重建，扩散模型直接在这个语义结构化的潜在空间上进行训练。

Result: SVG实现了加速扩散训练、支持少步采样、提高生成质量，并保留了底层自监督表示的语义和判别能力。

Conclusion: SVG为任务通用、高质量的视觉表示提供了一条有原则的路径，展示了语义结构化的潜在空间对扩散模型训练和视觉生成的重要性。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Proto-Former通过原型学习机制成功解决了多数据集面部关键点检测的统一训练问题，为开发统一的面部关键点检测模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark
detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define
different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained
on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets
and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we
propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection
framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural
representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of
single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets
within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key
components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive
feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive
Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate
prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path
finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss
function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing
instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and
enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive
experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SHARE通过利用场景几何空间线索，显著提高了人体运动重建的3D定位精度，为各种应用场景提供了更可靠的人体-场景交互重建方案。

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
(SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

Result: 在三个基准测试中（两个大规模公共EEG数据集和一个临床ECoG数据集）均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Cortical-SSM能有效捕捉脑电信号的神经生理相关区域，为运动想象分类提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

Conclusion: 渐进冻结微调是提升多样化手术过程中工具存在检测的有前景技术，在通用图像分类任务中具有更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical
tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited
availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for
training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged
adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage
to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based
architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the
fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This
strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a
single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We
validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures
(ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical
tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our
method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and
established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of
96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the
fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct
domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that
gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool
presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader
applications in general image classification tasks.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注2D空间理解，缺乏评估6D空间推理的综合框架，需要开发新数据集来评估大型多模态模型的复杂3维空间推理能力。

Method: 创建了Spatial457合成数据集，包含4个关键空间推理能力：多物体识别、2D定位、3D定位和3D方向。采用级联评估结构，构建了7种问题类型和5个难度级别。

Result: 评估显示大型多模态模型在3D推理和6D空间任务上表现较差，性能随任务复杂度增加而下降。提出了相对性能下降率(RPDR)来量化这些挑战，并发现了不同属性间的预测偏差。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在复杂3D空间推理方面存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进。Spatial457数据集为评估和改进空间推理能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for
complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing
benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework
to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities.
To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased
synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning:
multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We
develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across
5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new
proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large
multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in
performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D
spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative
Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning
capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also
uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns
observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in

during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still
unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and
indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse
supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for
depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also
overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware
Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial
information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through
three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder
(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and
low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view
Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth
distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.
Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and
3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query
decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary
depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MDM（多模态扩散Mamba）架构，通过统一的变分自编码器和Mamba多步选择扩散模型，实现多模态信息的统一处理，在图像生成、文本理解等任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端多模态模型使用不同的编码器和解码器处理输入输出信息，这种分离阻碍了多模态的联合表示学习。

Method: 使用基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器逐步生成和精炼模态特定信息，实现编码和解码的统一处理。

Result: 在图像生成、图像描述、视觉问答、文本理解和推理任务中，MDM显著优于现有端到端模型，并能与GPT-4V、Gemini Pro等SOTA模型竞争。

Conclusion: MDM有效统一了多模态处理过程，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFGS是一个姿态感知的3D高斯泼溅框架，通过多姿态图像融合解决单姿态重建不完整的问题，实现更完整的物体重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法假设物体在单一静态姿态下捕获，导致重建结果不完整，无法处理遮挡或自遮挡区域。

Method: 通过迭代融合主要姿态和辅助姿态图像，结合全局和局部配准策略，利用背景特征进行姿态估计和基础模型进行跨姿态配准。

Result: PFGS在定性和定量评估中均优于基线方法，产生更完整的重建结果和更高保真度的3DGS模型。

Conclusion: PFGS通过智能集成基础模型和姿态感知融合策略，有效解决了多姿态物体重建的挑战，显著提升了重建完整性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality,
real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing
methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in
incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We
introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical
challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.
Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS
iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the
main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local
registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent
advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and
efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.
PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into
the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera
pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This
design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background
inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LILAC提出了一种实时长序列任意运动风格化的流式VAE-扩散框架，通过滑动窗口因果解码和注入解码运动特征来确保平滑过渡，无需依赖未来帧或修改扩散模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式方法直接在原始运动空间操作，计算开销大且难以保持时间稳定性；而基于潜在空间的VAE-扩散框架虽然质量高但仅限于离线处理，需要弥合这一差距以实现实时高质量运动风格化。

Method: 基于高性能离线任意运动风格化框架，构建潜在空间流式架构，采用滑动窗口因果设计和注入解码运动特征来确保平滑运动过渡。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在风格化质量和响应性之间取得了良好平衡，能够实现长序列实时任意风格化。

Conclusion: LILAC成功将离线VAE-扩散框架扩展到在线设置，实现了无需未来帧的实时长序列任意运动风格化，在质量和效率方面表现出色。

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames
or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance
between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments
on benchmark datasets. Supplementary video and examples are available at the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水下实例分割方法受限于封闭词汇预测，无法识别新的海洋类别，且从自然图像迁移到水下场景存在严重的视觉退化（如颜色衰减）和语义对齐问题。

Method: 提出统一框架包含两个互补组件：几何先验增强模块（GPEM）利用稳定的部件级和结构线索在视觉退化条件下保持对象一致性；语义对齐注入机制（SAIM）用领域特定先验丰富语言嵌入，缓解语义模糊性。

Result: 实验表明该框架在MARIS基准上一致优于现有开放词汇基线方法，无论是在域内还是跨域设置下。

Conclusion: 为未来水下感知研究建立了坚实基础，解决了水下开放词汇分割的关键挑战。

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future
underwater perception research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床采用多射扩散加权磁共振成像进行全身肿瘤诊断受到呼吸、蠕动等运动引起的严重相位伪影的限制，同时面临多器官、多切片、多方向和多b值的复杂性挑战。

Method: 将射间相位变化建模为高阶局部平滑相位，集成到低秩Hankel矩阵重建中，通过仅使用模拟生理运动的合成腹部DWI数据进行提示学习来自动设置算法秩参数。

Result: 在10,000+临床图像验证中：实现临床单射DWI两倍空间分辨率；单一模型泛化到7个解剖区域；在图像质量、伪影抑制和噪声降低方面优于最先进方法（11位放射科医生评估，p<0.05）。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了导航信号和真实数据监督，为高分辨率多器官多射DWI提供了可解释的鲁棒解决方案，其扫描仪无关性能在精准肿瘤学中具有变革潜力。

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe
motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on,
compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value
complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that
overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single
model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact
suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法要么学习攻击特定参数导致泛化能力差，要么依赖启发式原则限制准确性和效率，需要更通用的越狱攻击检测方案。

Method: LoD框架包含多模态安全概念激活向量模块进行安全导向表示学习，以及安全模式自编码器模块进行无监督攻击分类。

Result: 在多样化未知攻击上实现了一致更高的检测AUROC，同时提高了效率。

Conclusion: LoD框架通过任务特定学习有效检测未知越狱攻击，在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

TL;DR: Semantic4Safety框架使用零样本语义分割从街景图像中提取11个可解释的街道指标，结合道路类型分析交通事故数据，通过XGBoost分类器和SHAP解释特征贡献，应用GPS加权和ATE估计量化因果效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决街景图像在交通风险评估中的两个核心挑战：如何构建捕捉事故相关特征的街道级指标，以及如何量化它们对不同事故类型的因果影响。

Method: 使用零样本语义分割提取11个街道指标，结合道路类型分析3万条事故记录；训练XGBoost多分类器并用SHAP解释特征贡献；应用GPS加权和ATE估计控制混杂因素并量化因果效应。

Result: 发现异质性的、特定于事故类型的因果模式：场景复杂性、暴露度和道路几何特征主导预测能力；更大的可驾驶区域和应急空间降低风险，而过度视觉开放可能增加风险。

Conclusion: 通过将预测建模与因果推断相结合，Semantic4Safety支持针对性干预和高风险走廊诊断，为城市道路安全规划提供了可扩展的数据驱动工具。

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual
openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal
inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk
corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road
safety planning.

TL;DR: 提出Predictive-Corrective(PC)范式，通过解耦建模任务加速学习。PCMambaNet包含预测先验模块和校正残差网络，利用解剖知识生成焦点图，专注于诊断相关的不对称区域，在脑MRI分割中实现SOTA精度且仅需1-5个epoch收敛。

Motivation: 解决端到端深度学习收敛慢、依赖大规模数据集的问题，特别是在数据稀缺的医学影像领域，提高学习效率和适用性。

Method: PC范式将建模任务解耦：1)预测先验模块利用双侧对称性生成低计算成本的粗略近似和焦点图；2)校正残差网络学习残差误差，专注于精炼挑战性区域和病理边界。

Result: 在高分辨率脑MRI分割实验中，PCMambaNet达到最先进精度，仅需1-5个epoch收敛，这是传统端到端模型无法实现的性能。

Conclusion: 通过显式融入领域知识简化学习目标，PCMambaNet有效缓解了数据低效和过拟合问题，实现了显著的学习加速。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
data inefficiency and overfitting.

TL;DR: 提出了证据优先的自适应框架EARL，通过强化学习让Video LLM主动选择关键帧并进行局部重采样，显著提升长视频推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频推理方法存在信息稀释问题，均匀采样会丢失关键证据，且缺乏有效的奖励机制来确保证据纯度。

Method: 基于"选择更少，推理更多"理念，开发证据感知强化学习框架，动态选择相关帧并进行局部重采样获取细粒度时间细节。

Result: 在五个视频推理基准测试中达到开源Video LLM的最新SOTA，7B模型在LongVideoBench、MVBench和VideoMME上分别达到59.8%、69.0%和64.9%。

Conclusion: 证据纯度的优先考虑和提出的框架有效性得到验证，为长视频推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

Motivation: 传统的基于RGB数据的视觉识别模型难以捕捉MAV复杂的时空特征，限制了区分不同动作的能力。

Method: 使用ResNet编码器从每个视角提取特征，采用多尺度特征金字塔保留时空细节，引入跨视角注意力模块建模模态间依赖关系，并设计多视角对齐损失确保语义一致性。

Conclusion: MAVR-Net通过多视角学习有效提升了MAV动作识别的性能，证明了多模态数据融合在复杂运动识别中的优势。

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示学习的夜间航拍跟踪器仅依赖空间定位监督，无法提供指向目标特征的细粒度线索，导致生成模糊提示，影响跟踪器准确聚焦目标特征的能力。

Method: 受视觉仿生学启发，DPTrack首先分层捕获目标的拓扑结构，利用拓扑属性丰富特征表示；然后编码器将这些拓扑感知特征压缩到方向核中；最后基于通道-类别对应关系的核引导提示模块在搜索区域特征中传播核来定位目标特征位置并转换为精确提示。

Result: 在已建立的基准测试上进行广泛评估，证明了DPTrack的优越性能。

Conclusion: DPTrack通过编码目标属性特征到方向核并生成精确提示，实现了鲁棒的夜间跟踪性能。

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at

Motivation: 微表情识别面临标注数据稀缺的问题，现有方法主要依赖简单的空间增强而忽视了时间增强策略，无法充分利用微表情的运动特性。

Method: 将每个微表情序列分解为起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个运动阶段，为每个阶段生成独立的动态图像，形成双阶段动态图像增强策略。

Result: 在CASME-II和SAMM数据集上的实验表明，该方法在识别准确率、未加权F1分数和未加权平均召回率方面均有显著提升，与空间增强结合可获得高达10%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、模型无关且在低资源设置下有效，为鲁棒和可泛化的微表情识别提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these
subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and
behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in
micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the
scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders
generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured
during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial
augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation
strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,
this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic
image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset
dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two
motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for
each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific
representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal
cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive
experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,
including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate
consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted
F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class
imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves
up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,
model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising
direction for robust and generalizable MER.

Conclusion: MRASfM框架有效解决了驾驶场景中多相机SfM的关键问题，在公开数据集和实际应用中均表现出优异的性能，为驾驶场景的三维重建提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统性地提出并研究了无人机视频-文本检索任务，针对无人机视频的独特特性（俯视视角、结构同质性强、目标组合语义表达多样），提出了多语义自适应挖掘方法，通过动态帧间变化和场景区域语义提取来增强对无人机视频内容的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机技术的发展，视频数据量急剧增加，迫切需要高效的语义检索方法。现有跨模态方法主要针对地面视角设计，无法有效处理无人机视频的俯视视角、结构同质性和目标组合多样性等特性。

Method: 提出多语义自适应挖掘方法，包含多语义自适应学习机制，通过自适应语义构建模块、分布驱动语义学习项和多样性语义项来深化文本与无人机视频模态的交互。还引入了跨模态交互特征融合池化机制来减少复杂背景干扰。

Conclusion: 针对无人机场景的专用检索机制是必要的，MSAM方法通过多语义自适应挖掘有效提升了无人机视频内容的理解和检索性能。

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合光流(COF)方法，整合面部微表情的起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个阶段，以提升微表情识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于光流的微表情识别方法通常只关注起始到顶点阶段，而忽略了顶点到结束阶段的关键时间动态信息。

Method: 引入结合光流(COF)方法，整合微表情的起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个阶段的光流信息，提供更全面的运动分析。

Result: 在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上的实验结果表明，COF方法优于单一光流方法，能更有效地捕捉微表情动态特征。

Conclusion: 结合光流方法通过整合微表情的完整时间动态，显著提升了微表情识别的性能。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
hidden emotions. Most Micro-Expression Recognition (MER) methods that rely on
optical flow typically focus on the onset-to-apex phase, neglecting the
apex-to-offset phase, which holds key temporal dynamics. This study introduces
a Combined Optical Flow (COF), integrating both phases to enhance feature
representation. COF provides a more comprehensive motion analysis, improving
MER performance. Experimental results on CASMEII and SAMM datasets show that
COF outperforms single optical flow-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing micro-expression dynamics.

Motivation: 解决历史文档分析中结构化内容在退化、非标准形式下出现的挑战，包括运动模糊、手写变异、曝光波动和杂乱背景等问题。

Method: 从127个二战时期档案视频片段中提取包含拍板的数据，提供完整帧标注和裁剪词图像，支持零样本和微调条件下的识别与检测模型评估。

Result: 尽管训练集较小（18个视频），微调仍带来显著性能提升，展示了该数据集在少样本学习场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: ClapperText为低资源档案环境下的鲁棒OCR和文档理解提供了一个现实且文化背景丰富的资源。

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

Conclusion: 该管道有效解决了植物3D重建中的运动模糊问题，为植物表型分析提供了可靠工具，并将公开源代码和数据集。

Abstract: 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth,
yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of
generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
points in time.

Conclusion: 该模型不仅是高效的模态转换工具，还能作为验证显微镜工作流中实验准确性和图像保真度的实用诊断工具。

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法，以更少参数实现更优性能。

Conclusion: HiMA架构通过有效结合不同模块的优势，在低光RAW图像增强任务中实现了效率与性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dataset aimed at detecting pedestrians'
intentions as they approach an ego-vehicle. The dataset comprises synchronized
multi-modal data, including fisheye camera feeds, lidar laser scans, ultrasonic

accurate 3D pedestrian positions extracted from lidar data, facilitating robust
benchmarking for perception algorithms. We release a portion of the dataset
along with a comprehensive benchmark suite, featuring evaluation metrics for

real-world challenges such as sensor occlusions, dynamic environments, and
hardware constraints, this dataset offers a unique resource for developing and
evaluating state-of-the-art algorithms in pedestrian detection, 3D pose
estimation and 4D trajectory and intention prediction. Additionally, we provide

TL;DR: ORCA提出了一种利用预训练文本到图像扩散模型获取任务自适应视觉表示的方法，通过可学习的任务提示和视觉提示来适应机器人控制环境，无需微调模型本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉表示在模仿学习中通常保持冻结状态，导致任务无关性。本文旨在利用文本到图像扩散模型获得任务自适应的视觉表示，以提升机器人控制性能。

Method: 提出ORCA方法，引入可学习的任务提示适应控制环境，以及视觉提示捕捉细粒度的帧级细节，通过新设计的条件促进任务自适应表示。

Result: 该方法在各种机器人控制基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著超越了先前的方法。

Conclusion: 通过考虑控制任务所需的特定动态视觉信息，ORCA成功地将预训练扩散模型应用于机器人控制，实现了性能的显著提升。

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced
imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during
policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic
control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively
applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains -
yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to
the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control
environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific,
dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA,
which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment
and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through
facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control
benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的无监督模型有潜力成为神经肿瘤影像学中可扩展、标签高效的工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for
neuro-oncological imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人脸识别模型虽然整体准确率高，但仍存在系统性偏差，传统基于标注属性的偏差评估方法成本高且受限于预定义类别。

Method: 使用潜在方向识别子群体的无属性标签算法，相比标准聚类能实现语义一致的分组和发现可解释的潜在方向。

Result: 在四个最先进的人脸识别模型和两个基准测试上，LFA在组内语义一致性方面持续优于k-means和最近邻搜索，并发现了与人口统计和上下文属性对齐的可解释潜在方向。

Conclusion: LFA可作为人脸识别模型表示审计的实用方法，使从业者无需预定义属性标注即可识别和解释偏差子群体。

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to
exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain
subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled
attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to
predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an
attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify
subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

Motivation: 解决传统相机运动分类模型在处理档案影片时性能下降的问题，因为档案影片存在噪声、缺失帧和低对比度等挑战

Method: 构建统一基准数据集，并在Video Swin Transformer基础上引入方向性网格运动编码，通过可学习的归一化后期融合层集成光流信息

Result: 在现代片段上将top-1准确率从81.78%提升至86.14%，宏F1从82.08%提升至87.81%；在二战档案片段上准确率从83.43%提升至84.62%，宏F1从81.72%提升至82.63%

Conclusion: 结构化运动先验与transformer表示具有互补性，即使小型精心校准的运动头也能显著增强退化影片分析的鲁棒性

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

Motivation: 系统研究卫星图像分类中的特定失败模式，开发无需依赖预训练模型的专用架构，解决卫星图像分类中的过拟合和类别不平衡问题。

Method: 通过三个渐进架构迭代：基线、CBAM增强和平衡多任务注意力。使用Coordinate Attention提取空间特征，Squeeze-Excitation块提取光谱特征，通过可学习融合参数统一。采用渐进DropBlock正则化和类别平衡损失加权。

Result: 最终12层架构达到97.23%测试准确率，Cohen's Kappa为0.9692，所有类别准确率超过94.46%。可学习融合参数自主收敛到alpha≈0.57，表明空间和光谱模态重要性接近相等。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural
network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%
test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.
Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,
CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify
and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our
principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that
combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with
Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a
learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this
learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,
indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for
satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by
network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and
confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's
Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating
confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect
predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned
ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of
systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型容易在隐含性暗示提示下生成不当内容，而现有检测方法主要针对显式内容，难以识别这些隐蔽线索。微调方法虽有效但会降低生成质量。

Method: 利用早期预测噪声的可分离性开发噪声检测方法；提出噪声增强的自适应负向引导机制，通过抑制显著区域注意力来优化初始噪声。

Result: 在自然和对抗数据集上验证，NDM性能优于现有SOTA方法（如SLD、UCE、RECE等）。

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and

TL;DR: SiM2P是一个基于3D扩散桥的框架，能够从MRI和患者辅助信息生成诊断质量的FDG-PET模拟图像，显著提高了痴呆症诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDG-PET在痴呆症诊断中具有重要作用，但与常规MRI相比可及性差且成本高昂，需要开发更经济可及的替代方案。

Method: 使用3D扩散桥框架学习从MRI和患者信息到FDG-PET图像的映射，仅需20个站点特定病例和基本人口统计学信息即可部署。

Result: 在盲法临床研究中，SiM2P将三组（阿尔茨海默病、行为变异型额颞叶痴呆、认知健康对照）的总体诊断准确率从75.0%提高到84.7%，且模拟PET图像获得更高的诊断确定性评分和更好的评分者间一致性。

Conclusion: SiM2P框架使FDG-PET的诊断优势在资源有限环境中更易获得，有望改善痴呆症的早期检测和鉴别诊断。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an
established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing
disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially
more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework
that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information
to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader
study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the
original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's
disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy
controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of
differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the
simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved
superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed
a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires
as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This
approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more
accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially
improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于超像素的正则化方法，用于在粗标注条件下训练语义分割模型，显著提升边界召回率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当获取精细像素级标注困难或昂贵时，粗标注（如边界周围像素未标注）成为可行替代方案，但这类标注在优化类别边界对齐方面存在困难

Method: 在编码器-解码器架构中引入基于超像素的上采样正则化方法，鼓励解码图像中的分割像素形成SLIC超像素（基于像素颜色和位置，与分割标注无关）

Result: 在FCN-16架构上应用于SUIM、Cityscapes和PanNuke数据集，相比最先进模型，边界召回率显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法能有效利用粗标注训练语义分割模型，特别在边界对齐方面表现出色

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

Conclusion: 提出的视觉引导3D布局生成系统有效解决了现有方法的局限性，能够生成艺术性和连贯性的3D场景布局。

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推进机器智能需要开发像人类一样感知多模态世界的能力，因此需要构建强大的开源多模态大语言模型。

Method: 提出了三个关键创新：(i) OmniAlignNet用于增强视觉和音频嵌入在多模态潜在空间中的对齐；(ii) 时间嵌入分组用于捕捉视觉和音频信号之间的相对时间对齐；(iii) 约束旋转时间嵌入用于在多模态嵌入中编码绝对时间信息。还引入了生成2400万单模态和多模态对话的数据管理流程。

Conclusion: 多模态在感知和推理中相互增强，OmniVinci在机器人、医疗AI和智能工厂等下游应用中展示了多模态优势。

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive
across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce
OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream
applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DeepFake检测方法在真实世界条件下难以处理姿态变化、遮挡和难以检测的伪影，需要更鲁棒的检测方案。

Method: 集成三个专用编码器：全局视角检测边界不一致性，中观视角分析纹理和颜色对齐，局部视角捕捉眼睛、鼻子、嘴巴等表达性面部区域的失真。额外加入人脸朝向编码器来分类面部姿态。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数据集上实验结果表明，该方法优于传统的单视角方法。

Conclusion: 多视角架构通过融合不同层次的面部特征，能够在复杂条件下有效检测DeepFake图像。

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches

Motivation: 为了促进时空图像融合方法的应用，需要解决不同传感器图像在空间和光谱分辨率上的匹配问题。

Method: 比较了两种标准化方法：1）传统上采样方法；2）ABSIS锐化方法，该方法将精细分辨率图像序列的整体特征与特定粗分辨率图像的独特属性相结合。

Result: 两种方法都显著提高了USTFIP时空融合方法的准确性，其中锐化方法使融合图像的光谱和空间精度分别提高了49.46%和78.40%。

Conclusion: 提出的标准化方法，特别是ABSIS锐化方法，能有效提升时空图像融合的性能，使融合结果更接近精细分辨率图像聚合的效果。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images
across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited
cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval
combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible
framework that supports seven retrieval modes across four modalities: rgb,
infrared, sketches, and text. FlexiReID introduces an adaptive
mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality
features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature
extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a
unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four
modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves
state-of-the-art performance and offers strong generalization in complex
scenarios.

Result: 相比现有方法获得10倍速度提升，在复杂纹理上检测精度有所提高，与现有方法相比表现优异

Conclusion: QFCA方法在保持高精度的同时实现了实时性能，解决了现有方法在实际部署中的瓶颈问题

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
existing methods. Project page:

Result: 广泛测试表明，Noise2Detail在性能上超越了现有的无数据集技术，同时仅需少量计算资源。该方法在效率和计算成本方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: Noise2Detail结合了高效性、低计算成本和无需数据的方法，成为生物医学成像等领域的宝贵工具，克服了由于罕见和复杂成像模式导致的干净训练数据稀缺问题，同时实现了实际应用所需的快速推理。

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for
practical use.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work
in the field.

Motivation: 全监督医学图像分割需要大量像素级标注，成本高昂且耗时。为减轻标注负担，开发仅需极值点标注的弱监督方法。

Method: 使用极值点生成边界框作为SAM2提示生成伪标签，通过增强的FGEPM算法结合蒙特卡洛dropout不确定性估计进行边界追踪，引入USC损失和边界框对齐损失确保空间一致性和边界对齐。

Conclusion: 该弱监督框架在超声图像分割中具有有效性和实用性，为减少医学图像标注负担提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided
diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
ultrasound image segmentation.

Conclusion: 将传统分离的能力整合到单一医学框架中，能够在多样化的医学视觉语言任务中实现全面改进。

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at

Method: 采用融合领先图像编辑器和上下文视频生成器的数据生成流程，结合高效蒸馏模型架构和时间增强器，通过智能代理驱动整个流程进行质量控制和多样化指令生成。

Result: 投入超过12,000 GPU天构建了包含100万个高质量视频编辑示例的Ditto-1M数据集，训练出的Editto模型在指令式视频编辑方面表现出卓越的指令跟随能力，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: Ditto框架成功解决了指令式视频编辑的数据稀缺问题，通过可扩展的数据生成和质量控制方法，为指令式视频编辑的发展提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in
instruction-based video editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SEGA方法，通过分层推理框架解决内容感知布局生成问题，采用从粗到细的策略，结合布局设计原则作为先验知识，在多个基准数据集上取得最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用单步推理框架，缺乏基于反馈的自校正机制，在处理复杂元素布局规划时失败率显著增加。

Method: SEGA方法采用分层推理框架：粗粒度模块粗略估计布局规划结果，然后精炼模块对粗规划结果进行细粒度推理，并融入布局设计原则作为先验知识。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并发布了包含丰富元信息标注的大规模海报数据集GenPoster-100K。

Conclusion: SEGA通过分层推理和融入设计原则的方法，有效提升了内容感知布局生成的性能，特别是在复杂布局规划场景下。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which
aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given
background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a
single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction
mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with
complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA,
a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation.
Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical
reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level
module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining
module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results.
Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into
the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present
GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich
meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets. Our project page is at: https://brucew91.github.io/SEGA.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QSilk是一个轻量级的潜在扩散模型稳定层，通过微钳位和自适应分位数裁剪技术，在高分辨率下提升图像质量，无需训练且计算开销极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决潜在扩散模型中高频细节保真度不足和罕见激活尖峰的问题，提高低步数和高分辨率下的图像质量。

Method: 结合每样本微钳位限制极端值，以及自适应分位数裁剪(AQClip)根据局部结构统计或注意力熵调整允许值范围。

Result: 在SD/SDXL模型上获得更清晰、锐利的结果，与CFG/Rescale技术有协同效应，能使用更高指导强度而不产生伪影。

Conclusion: QSilk作为即插即用的稳定层，能有效提升潜在扩散模型的图像质量，特别适合低步数和高分辨率场景。

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

*Gaoxiang Huang,Songning Lai,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出轻量级解耦概念瓶颈模型(LDCBM)，通过自动将视觉特征分组为语义组件，改善概念与视觉模式的对齐，提升可解释性和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型存在输入到概念映射偏差和有限可控性问题，限制了实际价值并损害概念方法的可信度。

Method: 引入过滤器分组损失和联合概念监督，无需区域标注即可自动将视觉特征分组为语义有意义的组件。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的实验表明，LDCBM在概念准确率和分类准确率上均优于先前CBM方法。

Conclusion: 通过将概念建立在视觉证据基础上，该方法克服了先前模型的基本限制，增强了可解释AI的可靠性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of
interpretable AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取大规模标注数据成本高昂且耗时，现有生成方法存在内容位置不匹配和语义泄露问题，需要复杂后处理或大量微调。

Method: 在扩散采样过程中集成区域引导修正，利用预训练感知模型的反馈修正错误生成区域；提出区域对齐交叉注意力机制来增强图像区域与文本提示之间的空间语义对齐。

Result: ReCon显著提高了生成数据的质量和可训练性，在各种数据集、骨干架构和数据规模下都实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: ReCon框架有效解决了生成数据增强中的内容位置不匹配和语义泄露问题，为训练鲁棒感知模型提供了高质量的数据增强方案。

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception
models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and
time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data
augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions.
However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or
extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and
they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework
that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for
object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the
diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model
to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further
propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment
between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic
consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data,
achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone
architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ERNet：一种高效的前馈模型，用于处理非刚性变形的点云序列配准，通过两阶段管道预测变形图序列，在准确性和效率上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非刚性变形点云配准中的两个关键挑战：(i) 由于配准目标的非凸性导致的局部最小值问题，特别是在噪声或部分输入下；(ii) 长序列中的误差累积导致跟踪失败。

Method: 采用可扩展的数据驱动方法，通过两阶段管道预测变形图序列：首先估计帧级粗粒度图节点进行鲁棒初始化，然后在滑动窗口方式下随时间细化其轨迹。

Result: 在DeformingThings4D和D-FAUST数据集上优于先前最先进方法，相比先前最佳方法实现了4倍以上的加速，提供了显著的效率提升。

Conclusion: ERNet能够有效处理噪声和部分输入，同时利用时间信息进行准确一致的序列配准，在准确性和效率方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
(i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

TL;DR: VISTA是一个多代理系统，通过迭代循环自动改进视频生成质量，通过分解用户想法、识别最佳视频、专业代理批评和推理代理重写提示来实现持续优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频合成方法严重依赖精确的用户提示，而现有的测试时优化方法在处理视频的多方面特性时表现不佳。

Method: VISTA采用多代理系统：首先将用户想法分解为结构化时间计划，生成后通过成对锦标赛识别最佳视频，然后由专注于视觉、音频和上下文保真度的专业代理进行批评，最后由推理代理综合反馈并重写提示进行下一轮生成。

Result: 在单场景和多场景视频生成实验中，VISTA相比现有方法持续改进视频质量和用户意图对齐，达到60%的成对胜率，人类评估者在66.4%的比较中偏好VISTA输出。

Conclusion: VISTA通过自主迭代改进机制，显著提升了文本到视频生成的质量和对齐度，为视频合成领域提供了有效的优化方法。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality
remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time
optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the
multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video
Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously
improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA
first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation,
the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning
video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual,
audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this
feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next
generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation
scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA
consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving
up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human
evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

*Jiayi Lin,Jiabo Huang,Shaogang Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RelateSeg通过神经符号空间推理，在开放词汇语义分割中引入一阶逻辑约束，解决传统视觉语言模型缺乏空间关系理解的问题，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于视觉语言模型的开放词汇语义分割方法缺乏对场景中物体空间关系的理解，这限制了分割性能，特别是对于包含多个类别的图像。

Method: 提出RelateSeg方法，自动提取空间关系（如<猫，在右侧，人>），将其编码为一阶逻辑公式，通过伪类别同时预测语义类别和空间伪类别，使用模糊逻辑松弛在深度网络架构中实现端到端学习。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上实现了平均mIoU的最先进性能，特别在包含多个类别的图像上表现优势，仅引入单个辅助损失函数且无额外参数。

Conclusion: 神经符号空间推理在开放词汇语义分割中具有有效性，RelateSeg通过显式空间关系约束显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from
an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled
objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches
with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of
spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary
VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)
to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)
formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to
explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically
extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them
as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel
learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo
category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational
constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally,
these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy
logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally
consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows
clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of
only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,
validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

Motivation: 传统图形学方法通过可微分渲染将输入图像分解为几何、材质和光照，但受限于底层模型的假设和近似。需要一种能够处理单目肖像图像重新照明这一欠约束问题的方法。

Method: 使用预训练的生成式头部模型提供几何先验，通过编码器将输入图像嵌入到潜在空间。然后使用基于三元平面的反射网络合成高质量单光源图像，实现在给定HDRI环境贴图下的物理准确重新照明。

Result: 3DPR在定量和定性评估中优于先前方法，特别在保持身份特征和捕捉光照效果（如镜面反射、自阴影和次表面散射）方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合生成式头部模型的几何先验和光舞台数据训练的反射网络，成功解决了单目肖像重新照明问题，实现了高质量的图像基重新照明效果。

Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:

Motivation: 传统监督模型需要大量标注数据，而SAM系列模型依赖人工提示。本文旨在开发一种无需训练和人工干预的自动舌象分割方法。

Method: 使用DINOv3特征和FAISS检索构建小型记忆库，通过检索相似案例自动生成前景/背景点提示来指导SAM2模型进行分割。

Result: 在600张专家标注图像上测试，Memory-SAM达到mIoU 0.9863，优于FCN(0.8188)和检测器到框的SAM基线(0.1839)，在真实场景下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 检索到提示的方法能够实现数据高效、鲁棒的舌象不规则边界分割，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised
models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain
prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free
pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of
prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image,
mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into
foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or
model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled,
300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863,
surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On
controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less
meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains
under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables
data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

Conclusion: 该研究确定了四个关键见解：架构选择的重要性、强化学习的应用价值、图像编辑的挑战性以及数据质量和规模的决定性作用，为未来图像生成模型的发展提供了重要指导。

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3
series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT
unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single
architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing
capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,
we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable
performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales
efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of
reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image
generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction
following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be
significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality
and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of
model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an
Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first
generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden
states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate
high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and
instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering
ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.
Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks
show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

Abstract: Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban
scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied
applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality
real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this
paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by
synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic
coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality
close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block
scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring
real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative
refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and
photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS
provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures

*Alana Renda,Jillian Ross,Michael Cafarella,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenEstimate是一个用于评估语言模型在不确定性下进行数值估计任务的多领域基准测试，发现前沿语言模型的概率先验通常不准确且过于自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中语言模型需要处理不完整信息并在不确定性下进行推理，但现有评估主要关注有明确答案的问题，缺乏对不确定性推理能力的系统评估。

Method: 开发了OpenEstimate基准测试，通过数值估计任务评估语言模型，要求模型综合大量背景信息并以概率先验形式表达预测，评估其准确性和校准度。

Result: 在六个前沿语言模型上的测试显示，模型生成的先验通常不准确且过于自信，性能仅通过不确定性激发方式有轻微改善，采样策略、推理努力或提示设计的改变影响不大。

Conclusion: OpenEstimate为前沿语言模型提供了一个具有挑战性的评估平台，有助于开发在概率估计和不确定性推理方面表现更好的模型。

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

Result: 该方法产生了有效的智能体行为，并在各种环境配置中展现出鲁棒的泛化能力，为基于机器学习的自主游戏关卡设计开辟了新机会。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习能够使智能体在虚拟环境中同时生成和解决内容，扩展了AI在创意游戏开发过程中的贡献边界。

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular
technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic,
replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this
study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system
comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating
island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects
(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The
hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

TL;DR: 该论文认为AGI进展受理论限制而非数据或规模限制，提出因果力学方法，通过错误发现和修正来扩展假设空间，强调干预能力和机制优先的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战柏拉图表示假说，指出仅观察充分性无法保证干预能力，需要从观察学习转向错误中心的方法来推进AGI发展。

Method: 提出因果力学方法，包含三个核心问题：错误在行动下的演化、固定假设空间中不可达错误、如何通过猜想和批评扩展假设空间。引入结构原则如局部性和自主性原则、独立因果机制、组合自主性原则。

Result: 建立了一个框架，使系统能够将不可达错误转化为可达错误并进行修正，强调假设空间变化作为首要操作。

Conclusion: AGI进展需要理论突破，因果力学提供了一种机制优先的方法，通过错误发现和修正来扩展智能系统的能力，特别是干预能力。

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale
limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型主要模拟群体共识，缺乏对个体推理风格和信念轨迹的个性化捕捉，需要开发能更好模拟人类个体推理的AI系统。

Method: 采用双轨道设计：合成轨道用于大规模系统压力测试，人类轨道提供生态有效的"出声思考"推理数据，评估模型的个体推理适应能力。

Conclusion: HugAgent为机器推理与人类个体思维的对齐提供了首个可扩展基准，推动了更人性化AI推理的发展。

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as
HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking

Motivation: 解决真实工作环境中情感识别面临的挑战，特别是缺乏大规模、纵向的自然环境数据集的问题。

Method: 使用深度学习面部表情识别技术，收集员工面部表情数据，计算七种情感概率，并提供32种扩展情感指标，包括效价、唤醒度、波动性等。

Result: 数据集质量验证成功复制了已知心理模式（周末效应：效价提升192%，p<0.001），员工流失预测AUC达到1.0，基线实验情感分类准确率91.2%，效价预测R²=0.84。

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,
enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling,
emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.

TL;DR: 本文提出AGI评估应基于领域因果中心性加权并测试能力持久性，而非传统对称权重和快照测试，以更好衡量通用智能的稳态特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AGI评估使用对称权重和快照分数，无法反映不同领域的重要性差异，也不能区分持久能力与脆弱表现。人类智能研究表明智能是稳态特性集群。

Method: 提出两种评估扩展：基于CHC理论的中心性优先评分，以及包含配置文件持久性、持久学习和错误纠正的集群稳定性指数家族。

Result: 这些扩展保持了多领域广度，同时减少了脆弱性和博弈行为，提供了更稳健的AGI评估框架。

Conclusion: AGI评估应加权关键领域并测试能力持久性，这能更好捕捉通用智能的稳态本质，并提供了可实施的测试协议。

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without
architectural access.

Motivation: 在大数据时代，处理海量异构复杂关联的多维数据面临挑战。大语言模型存在幻觉问题且难以实时更新，知识图谱静态特性限制动态交互分析能力。

Method: 利用LLM智能体从非结构化数据自动提取产品数据，实时构建和可视化知识图谱，通过交互平台支持用户深度探索分析图节点。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在产品生态系统分析、关系挖掘和用户驱动探索分析方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为多维数据分析提供了新思路和工具，构建了动态协作的分析生态系统。

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KG-Agent是一个经验驱动的学习框架，通过将像素级GUI交互构建为状态-动作知识图来解决API缺失环境下LLM代理的低效探索问题，显著提升了探索效率和战略深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件大多缺乏可访问API，代理只能通过像素级GUI操作，导致LLM代理在API缺失环境下面临严重效率瓶颈：局限于局部视觉体验，做出短视决策，依赖低效试错，阻碍技能获取和长期规划。

Method: 提出KG-Agent框架，将原始像素级交互构建为持久的状态-动作知识图(SA-KG)，通过连接功能相似但视觉不同的GUI状态形成经验邻域；设计基于图拓扑的混合内在奖励机制，结合状态价值奖励和新颖性奖励，解耦战略规划与纯发现。

Result: 在Civilization V和Slay the Spire两个复杂开放式GUI决策环境中评估，相比最先进方法在探索效率和战略深度方面取得显著改进。

Conclusion: KG-Agent通过结构化经验知识图有效解决了API缺失环境下代理的低效探索问题，实现了更高效的技能获取和长期规划能力。

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有代理系统主要存储文本信息，忽略了多模态信号的重要性。受人类记忆多模态特性的启发，作者希望开发一个更符合认知科学原理的多模态代理系统。

Method: 系统包含4个循环阶段：编码（理解输入）、存储到记忆（保存重要信息）、检索（从记忆中搜索相关上下文）、行动（执行任务）。采用语义标签和图结构的多模态上下文记忆，而非传统的向量数据库。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中比传统多模态RAG方法快3.5倍，在MSC基准测试中优于MemGPT。

Conclusion: AUGUSTUS通过模拟人类记忆的多模态特性，在概念驱动检索方面表现出色，为多模态代理系统提供了新的设计思路。

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

Abstract: Witnessed by the recent advancements on leveraging LLM for coding and

unbounded and extensible agentic crawling framework that continuously collects
real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a
structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata,
localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit
alignment between content, layout, and visual components for detailed
multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol
aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments
with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML
generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and

Motivation: 当前多模态大模型的数据增强方法存在视觉感知不足导致的事实错误和幻觉问题，需要提升监督微调数据的质量。

Method: 使用视觉识别模型和OCR系统提取结构化视觉先验，结合三个LMM评估原始答案，通过统计融合生成高置信度共识分数，训练轻量级评论模型，最终选择得分最高的精炼答案。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，使用VERITAS处理数据微调的模型性能优于使用原始数据的模型，尤其在文本丰富和细粒度推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: VERITAS能有效提升多模态数据质量，其评论模型在保持高效的同时具备与先进LMM相当的能力，为多模态数据优化研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B和1.5B模型上，DEPO将序列长度减少39%，减少了无效token中的过度推理路径，同时在整体准确性上优于基础模型。

Conclusion: DEPO框架有效解决了大推理模型的过度推理问题，在显著减少响应长度的同时保持了模型性能，为推理效率优化提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法能够平衡布线和面积效率，最终满足工业标准，为模拟集成电路布局提供了有效的布线感知解决方案。

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了可修正性目标的概念，通过一个转换方法可以将任何可修正的目标转化为可修正版本，同时不牺牲性能。该方法通过条件奖励预测来实现，确保AI不会抵制训练更新或关闭。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在训练过程中可能会抵制目标更新，因为部分学习的目标会激励AI继续追求这些目标。可修正性对于训练收敛、纠正错误和适应人类偏好变化至关重要，但目前缺乏既具有可修正性又与不可修正替代方案竞争的目标规范。

Method: 首先形式化定义可修正性，然后引入一个转换方法，通过条件性地获取在无成本阻止更新情况下的奖励预测来构建任何可修正目标的可修正版本。该方法可以递归扩展到由可修正代理创建的新代理，并防止代理故意修改其目标。

Result: 两个网格世界实验表明，这些可修正目标可以有效地学习，并产生期望的行为。

Conclusion: 提出的转换方法能够构建既具有可修正性又具有竞争力的目标，为AI安全提供了重要保障，特别是在处理目标更新和关闭时。

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

Result: 从Qwen3-4B训练的MARS智能体在保留游戏中性能提升达28.7%，在推理基准测试中多智能体系统性能持续提升，在AIME上提升10.0%，GPQA-Diamond上提升12.5%。

Conclusion: 在策略游戏中通过自博弈进行端到端RL训练是开发LLM可泛化多智能体推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code
and models are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-nics/MARS.

TL;DR: Adaptive Minds是一个智能代理系统，将LoRA适配器视为领域专用工具，让基础LLM作为语义路由器动态选择最相关的LoRA工具，实现按需切换领域专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法依赖单一微调模型或基于规则路由的局限性，实现更灵活、高效的领域自适应AI助手。

Method: 使用LangGraph进行工作流管理，基础LLM分析查询语义并动态选择相关LoRA适配器，结合多代理编排和参数高效微调。

Result: 系统能够提供准确的专业化响应，同时保持对话能力，支持API和Web接口，完全开源。

Conclusion: Adaptive Minds为领域自适应AI助手提供了可扩展和可扩展的基础架构，结合了灵活性和效率。

Abstract: We present Adaptive Minds, an agentic system that treats LoRA adapters as
domain-specific tools. Instead of relying on a single fine-tuned model or rigid
rule-based routing, our approach empowers the base LLM itself to act as a
semantic router analyzing each query and dynamically selecting the most
relevant LoRA tool. This enables the agent to seamlessly switch between
different domain experts on demand. By combining the flexibility of multi-agent
orchestration with the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Adaptive
Minds delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational
ability. The system is built with LangGraph for workflow management, supports
both API and web interfaces, and is fully open source, providing a scalable and
extensible foundation for domain-adaptive AI assistance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个检测和解决强化学习中判断不一致性的框架，包括冲突检测率(CDR)指标和去冲突图奖励(DGR)方法，显著提升训练稳定性和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在强化学习中面临判断不一致性问题，特别是偏好循环等逻辑一致性问题尚未得到充分解决，这会影响强化学习的稳定性。

Method: 开发了包含CDR指标和DGR框架的综合方法：CDR量化判断冲突，DGR通过构建偏好图、转换为无冲突有向无环图、生成逻辑一致的奖励信号来净化信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架相比强基线方法显著提升了训练稳定性和模型性能。

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性是AI反馈中关键且现在可管理的重要维度，该框架为解决判断不一致性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

TL;DR: 提出MM-HCAN多模态超图对比注意力网络，用于电机故障诊断，通过超图拓扑和对比学习实现多模态传感器融合，在三个真实基准测试中达到99.82%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉复杂多模态信号关系，局限于单模态数据或单一故障类型，且在噪声或跨域条件下性能下降，需要更鲁棒的故障诊断方案。

Method: MM-HCAN将对比学习集成到专为多模态传感器融合设计的超图拓扑中，联合建模模态内和模态间依赖关系，超越欧几里得嵌入空间增强泛化能力。

Result: 在三个真实基准测试中达到99.82%准确率，具有强大的跨域泛化能力和噪声鲁棒性，能够同时诊断轴承、定子和转子故障。

Conclusion: MM-HCAN为综合多故障诊断提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，支持工业环境中的预测性维护和资产寿命延长。

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JudgeSQL是一个通过结构化推理和加权共识锦标赛机制改进SQL候选选择的框架，解决了现有方法在语义模糊和复杂推理方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SQL选择方法（如自一致性或最佳N解码）只能提供浅层信号，容易产生不一致评分、脆弱推理链，且无法捕捉密切相关的SQL候选项之间的细粒度语义差异。

Method: 开发基于推理的SQL判断模型，通过强化学习提炼可验证奖励的推理轨迹；采用加权共识锦标赛机制，整合显式推理偏好和隐式生成器置信度。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试上的广泛实验表明，JudgeSQL展现出卓越的SQL判断能力、良好的跨尺度泛化能力以及对生成器容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JudgeSQL通过结构化推理和加权共识机制，为SQL候选选择提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale
generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个机器学习框架，整合患者历史就诊信息来改进健康监测，特别适用于就诊次数有限且频率不稳定的情况。该模型首先基于最近就诊数据评估初始疾病风险，然后利用历史影像和临床生物标志物信息进行精炼。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学中的时间背景对于评估患者健康状况随时间变化至关重要。当患者就诊次数有限且频率不稳定时，如何有效利用历史信息来改善健康监测是一个重要挑战。

Method: 开发了一个两阶段机器学习框架：1）使用最近就诊的医疗数据估计初始疾病风险；2）利用先前收集的影像和/或临床生物标志物信息来精炼风险评估。应用于前列腺癌风险预测，使用大规模数据集（28,342名患者，39,013次MRI扫描，68,931次血液测试）。

Result: 整合历史背景显著提高了特异性同时保持高敏感性：1）对于就诊时临床显著前列腺癌风险预测，假阳性率从51%降至33%（整合3次历史影像检查），进一步降至24%（加入临床数据）；2）对于5年内前列腺癌风险预测，假阳性率从64%降至9%。

Conclusion: 随时间收集的信息为医学风险预测提供了相关背景，能显著提高特异性。对于各种进展性疾病，通过背景信息充分降低假阳性率，可为低基线风险的大规模人群扩展纵向健康监测项目提供途径，从而实现早期检测和改善健康结果。

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient
health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate
diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when
prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型生成的科学协议往往不完整或不一致，限制了其在可重复科学研究中的实用性。

Method: 提出"草图-填充"范式，将分析、结构化和表达分离；采用结构化组件奖励机制评估步骤粒度、行动顺序和语义保真度；开发Thoth模型，通过分阶段的知识到行动过程进行训练。

Result: Thoth在多个基准测试中持续超越专有和开源LLM，在步骤对齐、逻辑排序和语义准确性方面取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠的科学助手铺平了道路，能够有效连接知识与实验执行。

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for
science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed
workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context
management that hinders long-horizon research. We present
\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring
\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a
\coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --
users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific
requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including
\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable
co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of
automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --
from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.

Result: 证明了三个或更多响应的排名（即使不完整）能确保可识别性，并建立了具有公平性能保证的生成策略。

Conclusion: 这些贡献为生成模型对齐中不同用户的公平性和个性化建立了理论和算法框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator
types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation
algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single
generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these
contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness
and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with
established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and

Motivation: 传统多模态方法存在两个主要限制：(1)训练时需要同步所有模态，(2)推理时依赖所有模态，这阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 将多模态学习建模为多目标优化问题，引入基于边界的类别重平衡策略来处理模态内不平衡问题。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，TRIP在异步设置下比最佳基线分别提升16.48、6.89和11.55个百分点，在同步设置下分别提升4.86和2.30个百分点。

Conclusion: TRIP框架在帕金森病评估中实现了最先进的性能，展现了其有效性和适应性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

Motivation: 解决AI系统在处理复杂多维问题（如司法框架、环境污染、疫情韧性等）时缺乏通过经验发展专业知识的内生机制的问题。

Method: 使用Dialectica框架，让代理在定义的主题上进行结构化对话，结合记忆、自我反思和策略约束的上下文编辑，将讨论视为隐式元强化学习过程。

Result: 在两个模型架构上的评估显示，启用基于反思的上下文编辑的代理在Elo分数、标准化Bradley-Terry-Davidson能力和AlphaRank质量上优于基线版本。

Conclusion: 对话驱动的上下文演化是在开放不可验证领域中实现目标专业知识放大的实用路径。

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and
qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical
path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Method: 开发并评估六种RAG语料库配置，使用LLM作为评判框架，在忠实性、相关性和全面性指标上评估，使用LongCOVID-CQ专家生成临床问题数据集。

Result: 结合临床指南和高质量系统评价的RAG配置持续优于单一指南方法和大型文献数据库，为新兴疾病提供了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 对于新兴疾病，基于精选二次评价的检索在狭窄共识文档和未过滤原始文献之间提供了最佳平衡，支持临床决策同时避免信息过载和过度简化指导。

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research
agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and
synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow
retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce
PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified
reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability.
PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from
AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward
signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction
adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further
enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool
failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This
highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce
efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents. The model and inference
code is open-sourced under MIT license at
