### [1] [Characterising the properties of the atmospheric emission at Teide Observatory in the 10-20 GHz range with QUIJOTE data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19878)
*Apolline Chappard,José Alberto Rubiño-Martín,Ricardo Tanausú Génova Santos*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: QUIJOTE实验分析特内里费天文台的大气条件，使用MFI和MFI2仪器在11-19GHz频段观测，研究大气湍流特性及其对宇宙微波背景研究的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进特内里费天文台在这些频率下的大气模型，并经验性地表征大气湍流特性，为宇宙微波背景研究和未来仪器开发提供支持。

Method: 使用GPS天线、STELLA天文台和无线电探空数据推导大气参数分布，分析MFI数据计算大气结构函数和相关性，利用MFI2观测估计大气功率谱。

Result: 水汽密度呈指数衰减，特征半高约1000米；2012-2018年PWV中值为3.3mm；高PWV条件下结构函数符合Kolmogorov湍流模型；大气条件稳定持续约1-2小时。

Conclusion: 研究成功表征了特内里费天文台的大气条件，验证了湍流模型，为未来宇宙微波背景实验和仪器设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: QUIJOTE is a CMB experiment composed of two telescopes, QT1 and QT2, located
at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife, Spain. The MFI instrument (2012-2018),
installed on QT1, observed the sky at four frequency bands (11, 13, 17, and 19
GHz) with one degree angular resolution. Its successor, MFI2, began operations
in 2024 and operates in the same bands. This paper has two main goals: first,
to characterise the atmospheric conditions at Teide Observatory to improve
existing models at these frequencies, and second, to empirically characterise
atmospheric turbulence using QUIJOTE MFI and MFI2 observations. This work has
implications for both atmospheric physics and CMB studies and can support
future reanalyses of MFI data or the preparation of upcoming instruments such
as the Tenerife Microwave Spectrometer. We used data from GPS antennas, the
STELLA observatory, and radio soundings to derive median profiles and
distributions of key atmospheric parameters for 2012-2018. MFI data were
analysed to compute atmospheric structure functions at 17 and 19 GHz and to
study the correlation properties of the atmospheric signal through
cross-correlation between horns at the same frequency. MFI2 observations were
used to estimate the atmospheric power spectrum and compare it with the
structure function derived from MFI data. The water vapour density profile
follows an exponential decay with a characteristic half-height of about 1000 m.
Median PWV in 2012-2018 is 3.3 mm. For high PWV conditions, the structure
function agrees with the Kolmogorov turbulence model. The slope of the power
spectrum also matches the model prediction, within the frequency range limited
by the outer scale and instrument noise. Finally, from the correlation
function, we find that atmospheric conditions remain stable for about 1-2
hours.

### [2] [Projecting Hurricane Risk in Atlantic Canada under Climate Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20074)
*Saeed Saviz Naeini,Reda Snaiki,Alejandro Di Luca*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究采用两阶段框架分析加拿大东部飓风风险：第一阶段量化风灾和沿海洪水灾害演变，第二阶段用风速作为总损失代理指标评估飓风风险。结果显示风极端事件加剧，沿海淹没显著扩大，许多沿海社区面临更高的风代理风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加拿大东部面临飓风威胁，包括破坏性风和沿海洪水，这些威胁在气候变化下预计会加剧。需要了解物理驱动因素如何变化以及这些变化如何转化为损失潜力。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）从历史基线到两个未来时期量化风和沿海洪水灾害演变，使用物理信息合成飓风轨迹构建灾害场；2）用风速作为总损失操作代理，结合模拟风场、暴露数据和脆弱性关系计算预期损失。

Result: 结果显示风极端事件加剧，沿海淹没显著扩大，许多沿海社区面临更高的风代理风险。空间模式显示风险异质性升级，集中在暴露海岸线和城市走廊。

Conclusion: 该综合分析为飓风损失可能增长的地点和程度提供了决策准备证据，阐明了物理驱动因素与损失潜力之间的联系，确保与工程和保险实践中使用的标准风中心工作流程兼容。

Abstract: Atlantic Canada faces significant hurricane threats from damaging winds and
coastal flooding that are projected to intensify under climate change. This
study adopts a two-stage framework. First, the evolution of wind and
coastal-flood hazards is quantified from a historical baseline (1979-2014) to
two future periods: a near future (2024-2059) and a far future (2060-2095).
Hazard fields are constructed from large ensembles of physics-informed
synthetic hurricane tracks, and changes are evaluated in return-period wind
speeds and in inundation depth and extent, with sea-level rise included for
flood projections. The second stage estimates hurricane risk using wind as an
operational proxy for total loss, combining the simulated wind fields with
exposure data and a vulnerability relationship to compute expected damages.
This design clarifies how physical drivers change and how those shifts
translate into loss potential without requiring fully coupled compound-loss
modeling. Results indicate an intensification of wind extremes and a
substantial amplification of coastal inundation, yielding higher wind-proxy
risk for many coastal communities. Spatial patterns show a heterogeneous
escalation of risk concentrated along exposed shorelines and urban corridors.
This comprehensive analysis of both hazard evolution and proxy risk provides
decision-ready evidence on where and by how much hurricane losses are likely to
grow. The approach clarifies the link between physical drivers and loss
potential, ensuring compatibility with standard wind-centric workflows used in
engineering and insurance practice.

### [3] [Learning Coupled Earth System Dynamics with GraphDOP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20416)
*Eulalie Boucher,Mihai Alexe,Peter Lean,Ewan Pinnington,Simon Lang,Patrick Laloyaux,Lorenzo Zampieri,Patricia de Rosnay,Niels Bormann,Anthony McNally*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: GraphDOP是一个基于图的机器学习模型，直接从原始卫星和现场观测数据学习天气预报，无需依赖再分析产品或传统物理NWP模型，能够隐式捕捉跨域交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球系统不同组件（海洋、大气、陆地、冰冻圈）之间的相互作用是全球天气模式的关键驱动因素，但准确表示这些耦合交互仍然是天气预报的主要科学和技术挑战。

Method: GraphDOP同时将来自不同观测源的信息嵌入到共享的潜在空间中，使预测能够隐式捕捉跨域交互，无需任何显式耦合。

Result: 案例研究表明GraphDOP能够成功预测耦合过程起关键作用的事件，包括北极快速海冰冻结、飓风伊恩期间的混合诱导海洋表面冷却以及2022年欧洲严重热浪。

Conclusion: 直接从地球系统观测中学习可以成功表征和传播跨组件交互，为使用单一模型实现物理一致的数据驱动地球系统端到端预测提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Interactions between different components of the Earth System (e.g. ocean,
atmosphere, land and cryosphere) are a crucial driver of global weather
patterns. Modern Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems typically run
separate models of the different components, explicitly coupled across their
interfaces to additionally model exchanges between the different components.
Accurately representing these coupled interactions remains a major scientific
and technical challenge of weather forecasting. GraphDOP is a graph-based
machine learning model that learns to forecast weather directly from raw
satellite and in-situ observations, without reliance on reanalysis products or
traditional physics-based NWP models. GraphDOP simultaneously embeds
information from diverse observation sources spanning the full Earth system
into a shared latent space. This enables predictions that implicitly capture
cross-domain interactions in a single model without the need for any explicit
coupling. Here we present a selection of case studies which illustrate the
capability of GraphDOP to forecast events where coupled processes play a
particularly key role. These include rapid sea-ice freezing in the Arctic,
mixing-induced ocean surface cooling during Hurricane Ian and the severe
European heat wave of 2022. The results suggest that learning directly from
Earth System observations can successfully characterise and propagate
cross-component interactions, offering a promising path towards physically
consistent end-to-end data-driven Earth System prediction with a single model.

### [4] [CSU-PCAST: A Dual-Branch Transformer Framework for medium-range ensemble Precipitation Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20769)
*Tianyi Xiong,Haonan Chen*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 开发基于深度学习的集合预报框架，通过联合建模多变量大气数据，在15天预报中相比传统GEFS系统显著提升了中到大雨的预报技巧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报系统在中长期降水预报，特别是中到大雨预报方面表现不佳，需要开发更准确的预报方法用于水文气象风险管理和灾害减轻。

Method: 使用Swin Transformer架构，结合周期性卷积处理经度连续性，采用双分支解码器预测降水和其它变量，训练时最小化CRPS和加权log1pMSE混合损失函数。

Result: 相比GEFS系统，在0.1mm、1mm、10mm和20mm降水阈值上获得了更高的临界成功指数(CSI)，表明对中到大雨预报性能有显著提升。

Conclusion: 深度学习集合预报框架能够有效提升中长期降水预报的准确性，特别是在中到大雨事件预报方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate medium-range precipitation forecasting is crucial for
hydrometeorological risk management and disaster mitigation, yet remains
challenging for current numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. Traditional
ensemble systems such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) struggle to
maintain high skill, especially for moderate and heavy rainfall at extended
lead times. This study develops a deep learning-based ensemble framework for
multi-step precipitation prediction through joint modeling of a comprehensive
set of atmospheric variables. The model is trained on ERA5 reanalysis data at
0.25$^{\circ}$ spatial resolution, with precipitation labels from NASA's
Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement
(GPM) constellation (IMERG), incorporating 57 input variables, including
upper-air and surface predictors. The architecture employs a patch-based Swin
Transformer backbone with periodic convolutions to handle longitudinal
continuity and integrates time and noise embeddings through conditional layer
normalization. A dual-branch decoder predicts total precipitation and other
variables, with targeted freezing of encoder-decoder pathways for specialized
training. Training minimizes a hybrid loss combining the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) and weighted log1p mean squared error (log1pMSE),
balancing probabilistic accuracy and magnitude fidelity. During inference, the
model ingests real-time Global Forecast System (GFS) initial conditions to
generate 15-day forecasts autoregressively. Evaluation against GEFS using IMERG
data demonstrates higher Critical Success Index (CSI) scores at precipitation
thresholds of 0.1 mm, 1 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm, highlighting improved performance
for moderate to heavy rainfall.

### [5] [Fourier-Based GAN Fingerprint Detection using ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19840)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用频域分析和深度学习来区分StyleGAN生成的图像与真实图像，通过2D傅里叶变换检测周期性伪影，ResNet50模型在频域上达到92.8%准确率和0.95 AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN生成的逼真图像对图像取证和工业系统的内容真实性构成挑战，需要可靠的方法来区分真实与合成图像。

Method: 应用二维离散傅里叶变换将图像转换到频域，利用ResNet50神经网络在频域图像上训练分类模型。

Result: 频域模型达到92.8%准确率和0.95 AUC，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的同等模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成图像具有独特的频域特征，结合信号处理和深度学习的方法在数字取证和工业AI系统可信度方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [6] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了将Vision Transformers与对比学习目标结合用于3D形状特征表示学习，在ModelNet10上达到90.6%准确率，克服了CNN在捕捉形状关系方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉方法在从2D图像识别3D物体时的挑战，传统方法需要大量标注数据且CNN可能忽略关键形状关系。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers架构配合对比学习目标（包括监督和自监督对比学习），进行多视角3D分析。

Result: 在ModelNet10数据集上，监督对比学习达到约90.6%的准确率，证明了ViT与对比学习结合的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT通过捕捉全局形状语义，结合对比学习优化局部判别特征，无需大量标注数据即可有效学习3D表示，为3D形状理解提供了统一框架。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [7] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack是一个模块化的相机-LiDAR多目标跟踪框架，通过引入基于transformer的平滑器和融合驱动的跟踪器，在现有3D检测器基础上构建。该框架使用多模态两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流程，无需显式运动模型，在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单传感器跟踪方法在多目标跟踪中存在局限性，需要开发能够有效融合多模态传感器特征的方法，以在遮挡和视角变化下实现鲁棒的重新识别。

Method: 采用基于查询的跟踪框架，包含多模态两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流程。融合跟踪器将边界框与来自多个相机和LiDAR的多模态BEV融合特征集成，无需显式运动模型。在跟踪前使用时间平滑器在移动窗口上精炼边界框序列。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到74.7的aMOTA，在3D MOT基准测试中表现出强大性能，减少了身份切换同时保持竞争性精度。相比之前的单传感器方法，基于查询的transformer跟踪方法从多模态传感器特征中获益显著。

Conclusion: FutrTrack提供了一个高效框架，用于改进基于transformer的跟踪器，使其即使在有限数据和无预训练情况下也能与其他基于神经网络的方法竞争。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [8] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在线标签平滑(OLS)方法在医学图像分类中通过动态调整软标签，相比传统方法提高了分类准确率和特征表示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中常产生过度自信的预测，传统标签平滑方法无法考虑类别间关系，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 使用在线标签平滑(OLS)方法，在训练过程中基于模型自身预测模式动态调整软标签，在RadImageNet数据集上评估了ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构。

Result: OLS在Top-1和Top-5分类准确率上均优于标准训练方法，包括硬标签、传统标签平滑和教师免费知识蒸馏，同时产生了更紧凑和分离的特征嵌入。

Conclusion: OLS不仅提升了预测性能，还改善了校准效果，是医学影像领域开发可信AI系统的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对鱼眼相机图像的目标检测框架，通过预处理和后处理管道提升在严重畸变区域的检测一致性，并采用集成策略提高整体检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼眼相机在广域交通监控中具有优势，但其强径向畸变和非均匀分辨率给标准目标检测器带来挑战，特别是在图像边界区域物体外观严重退化时。

Method: 采用简单有效的预处理和后处理管道，增强图像中检测一致性；训练多个先进检测模型，并通过集成策略结合它们的输出。

Result: 在2025 AI City Challenge Track 4中获得了0.6366的F1分数，在62个团队中排名第8。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效解决鱼眼图像固有的问题，在严重畸变条件下实现鲁棒检测。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [10] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时渲染感知过滤方法，通过中间梯度导出的敏感度分数来减少3D高斯分布模型在训练数据分布外视角下的视觉噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯分布模型在训练数据分布外的视角下会产生显著的视觉噪声，这是由于缺乏这些外推区域的训练数据导致模型在密度、颜色和几何预测上的不确定性。

Method: 利用从中间梯度导出的敏感度分数，专门针对由各向异性方向引起的不稳定性进行过滤，而不是各向同性方差。该方法直接处理生成不确定性的核心问题。

Result: 实验评估表明，与现有的基于神经辐射场的方法相比，该方法显著提高了视觉质量、真实感和一致性。过滤方法能够实时无缝集成到现有的3D高斯分布渲染流水线中。

Conclusion: 提出的实时渲染感知过滤方法有效解决了3D高斯分布模型在外推视角下的视觉噪声问题，无需进行大量的后训练或微调，保持了高视觉保真度。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了BrainPuzzle混合框架，结合物理建模和机器学习，通过两阶段方法在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下实现准确的脑部声速成像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理方法受颅骨衰减和稀疏孔径限制，纯数据驱动方法在复杂波传播建模上存在偏差，需要结合两者优势实现定量超声脑成像

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用反向时间迁移处理多角度采集数据生成迁移片段；第二阶段使用基于transformer的超分辨率编码器-解码器融合片段生成声速图像

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验显示，BrainPuzzle在声速重建精度和图像完整性方面表现优越

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle框架有潜力推进定量超声脑成像的发展，特别是在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了生成式图像模型中的文化偏见问题，特别关注了图像到图像编辑系统的文化失真现象，提出了一个标准化的文化中心评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本到图像系统的文化偏见，而图像到图像编辑系统的文化偏见问题尚未得到充分探索。作者旨在填补这一空白，系统评估生成式图像模型在不同国家、时代和类别中的文化表现。

Method: 采用统一评估框架，涵盖六个国家、8个类别/36个子类别的分类体系，以及时代感知提示词。结合标准自动指标、文化感知的检索增强VQA和来自本地评审专家的专业人工评估。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 在国家无关提示下，模型倾向于默认生成全球北方、现代风格的描绘，模糊了跨文化差异；(2) 迭代式I2I编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，即使传统指标保持不变或改善；(3) I2I模型仅应用表面线索而非时代一致、上下文感知的变化，对全球南方目标常保留源身份。

Conclusion: 当前系统中的文化敏感编辑仍不可靠。通过发布标准化数据、提示词和人工评估协议，为诊断和追踪生成式图像模型中的文化偏见提供了可复现的文化中心基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

Result: FIBAR在笔记本电脑CPU上处理速度达42-140百万事件/秒，重建图像比神经网络方法噪声更大且有鬼影，但足以完成某些任务如基准标记检测。

Conclusion: FIBAR提供了一种简单有效的异步事件图像重建方法，虽然重建质量不如神经网络方法，但在特定应用场景下足够使用且计算效率更高。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

Conclusion: TBTLRR通过自适应变换和双边结构有效提升了张量低秩表示的性能，在图像聚类中表现出优越性。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

Motivation: 视频评估和手术数据科学在手术培训、研究和质量改进中具有潜力，但受限于异构记录格式和视频共享的隐私担忧。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期和用户中心反馈，基于隐私设计架构开发，通过内部和外部临床医生调查评估可用性和采纳度。

Result: 用户报告高可用性(4.38/5)、感知有用性(5.07/7)和易用性(5.15/7)，处理时间受处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力影响。

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了透明、用户友好的标准化隐私保护手术视频管理流程，需要合规认证和更广泛互操作性验证来替代专有系统。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了注意力卷积（ATConv），通过引入自适应路由和横向抑制两个自注意力的核心原则来改进传统卷积，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了超越自注意力的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制虽然表达能力强，但其二次复杂度限制了实际应用。传统卷积具有线性复杂度但性能存在差距，需要找到自注意力优于卷积的内在原则。

Method: 提出ATConv，将自注意力的两个核心原则（自适应路由和横向抑制）融入卷积操作中，使用3×3卷积核即可实现超越自注意力的性能。

Result: 基于ATConv构建的AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4%的Top-1准确率（仅27M参数）；在扩散模型中替换自注意力可将FID降低0.15，且采样速度更快。

Conclusion: 通过将自注意力的核心原则融入卷积，可以在保持线性复杂度的同时获得超越自注意力的性能，为视觉主干网络提供了新的设计方向。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

Conclusion: StableSketcher框架成功解决了扩散模型在素描生成方面的局限性，通过专门的架构设计和数据集构建，显著提升了手绘素描的生成质量和语义对齐能力。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物学领域缺乏大规模、实例特定的描述性标题作为监督信号，限制了自然语言监督在生物多模态基础模型中的应用，而图像和标题可以视为物种潜在形态空间中的互补样本。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成合成标题，结合维基百科的视觉信息和针对特定分类群的格式示例，以减少幻觉并产生准确的实例描述性标题，然后利用这些标题训练BIOCAP模型。

Result: BIOCAP模型能够捕捉丰富的语义信息，在物种分类和文本-图像检索任务中表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: 描述性标题超越了传统标签的价值，能够有效桥接生物图像与多模态基础模型。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection

underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Conclusion: 逆图像渲染方法有效实现了从单张图像生成光场，展示了在合成数据集上训练后对真实数据的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后处理方法未充分利用模型logits空间中的丰富信息，需要更有效地利用logits关系来提升OOD检测性能。

Method: 提出LogitGap方法，显式利用最大logit与剩余logits的关系，并引入无训练策略自动识别最信息丰富的logits子集进行评分。

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验表明，LogitGap在多样化OOD检测场景和基准测试中始终达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap通过有效利用logits空间信息，为OOD检测提供了高效且性能优越的后处理解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Conclusion: 该方法通过累积多模态知识和自适应原型更新，有效应对了组合零样本学习中的分布偏移问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上达到与最先进β-VAE竞争的解耦分数，优于InfoGAN；在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上，生成样本的视觉质量和多样性在FID分数上优于β-VAE和InfoGAN。

Conclusion: IB-GAN通过信息瓶颈框架有效改进了GAN的解耦表示学习能力，在解耦性能和生成质量方面都表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA

TL;DR: 提出PPMStereo方法，通过Pick-and-Play Memory模块实现高效的长范围时空一致性深度估计，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立体视频中的时间一致性深度估计对于增强现实等应用至关重要，但现有方法在建模长时时间一致性时面临计算效率与性能的权衡问题。

Method: 受人类两阶段决策过程启发，提出Pick-and-Play Memory模块：'pick'过程选择最相关帧，'play'过程自适应加权选中的帧进行时空聚合。

Result: 在Sintel数据集上达到0.62/1.11 TEPE（相比BiDAStereo提升17.3%和9.02%），且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: PPMStereo通过两阶段协作过程实现了紧凑且信息丰富的内存缓冲区，在精度和时间一致性方面都达到了最先进性能。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

*Aaron Appelle,Jerome P. Lynch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估文本到视频和图像到视频模型作为行人动态隐式模拟器的基准测试协议，发现领先模型已学习到有效的多智能体行为先验，但仍存在合并和消失等失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单个主体而非多交互人群场景，生成视频中多智能体动态的合理性尚未得到验证。

Method: 为I2V使用现有数据集的起始帧与真实视频数据集比较；为T2V开发提示套件探索不同行人密度和交互；提出从像素空间重建2D鸟瞰轨迹的方法。

Result: 分析显示领先模型已学习到令人惊讶的有效多智能体行为先验，但存在合并和消失行人等失败模式。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估视频生成模型作为世界模拟器提供了严格基准，揭示了当前模型的优势和待改进领域。

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

TL;DR: SPAN网络将可疑意图检测从离散分类转向连续回归，捕捉动态演变的可疑意图，显著提升安全监控性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散分类方法无法捕捉可疑意图的连续性和波动性，限制了早期干预和可解释性

Method: 提出可疑进展分析网络(SPAN)，基于时序点过程理论建模长期依赖和累积效应，引入可疑系数调制和多模态信息调整，以及概念锚定映射方法

Result: 在HAI数据集上显著优于现有方法，MSE降低19.8%，平均mAP提升1.78%，低频情况下mAP增益达2.74%

Conclusion: 连续可疑意图建模方法能够实现更早检测和主动干预，极大增强系统可解释性和安全应用实用性

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

TL;DR: 该研究系统分析了54个公开脑MRI数据集，揭示了数据规模、模态组成、疾病覆盖等方面的不平衡性，以及预处理步骤后仍存在的显著异质性，强调需要预处理感知和领域自适应策略来开发泛化性强的脑MRI基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑MRI基础模型的发展严重依赖于数据的规模、多样性和一致性，但目前缺乏对这些因素的系统评估。

Method: 在数据集层面分析模态组成、疾病覆盖和规模；在图像层面量化体素间距、方向和强度分布；评估预处理变异性；使用3D DenseNet121进行特征空间案例研究。

Result: 发现健康队列与临床人群之间存在强烈不平衡，预处理步骤改善了数据集内一致性但数据集间差异仍然存在，标准化预处理后仍存在可测量的残差协变量偏移。

Conclusion: 公共脑MRI资源存在显著变异性，仅靠数据协调无法消除数据集间偏差，需要预处理感知和领域自适应策略来开发泛化性强的脑MRI基础模型。

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

TL;DR: RAPO++是一个跨阶段的提示优化框架，通过检索增强提示优化、样本特定提示优化和LLM微调，显著提升文本到视频生成质量，无需修改底层生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户提供的提示通常简短、非结构化且与训练数据不匹配，限制了基于扩散的文本到视频模型的生成潜力。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 检索增强提示优化，从关系图中检索语义相关修饰符并重构提示以匹配训练分布；2) 样本特定提示优化，使用多源反馈迭代优化提示；3) 利用优化后的提示对微调LLM，内化任务特定优化模式。

Result: 在五个最先进的T2V模型和五个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，RAPO++在语义对齐、组合推理、时间稳定性和物理合理性方面取得显著提升，大幅优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAPO++是一个模型无关、成本高效且可扩展的解决方案，为T2V生成中的提示优化设定了新标准。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: FlowCycle是一个基于流的免反演图像编辑框架，通过可学习的噪声参数化图像损坏过程，并利用循环一致性约束优化目标感知的中间状态，实现更忠实和一致的文本到图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本图像编辑方法采用目标无关的中间状态构建方式，主要关注源图像重建而忽略了与特定编辑目标的语义差距，导致在需要大幅修改时编辑能力有限或结果不一致。

Method: 提出FlowCycle框架，通过可学习噪声参数化图像损坏过程，采用循环一致性过程优化噪声，即从源图像编辑到目标图像再恢复回源图像的双向一致性约束，学习生成目标感知的中间状态。

Result: 广泛的消融实验表明，FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过目标感知的中间状态构建和循环一致性优化，有效解决了当前文本图像编辑方法在忠实修改和源一致性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统胎儿运动检测方法（如母体感知和胎心监护）存在主观性强和准确性有限的问题，需要更可靠的客观检测方法。

Method: 使用自监督对比学习框架，结合空间和时间双重对比损失，采用任务特定的采样策略，并通过概率微调方法实现任意长度视频的灵活推理。

Result: 在92名受试者、每段30分钟的超声数据集上，CURL实现了78.01%的敏感度和81.60%的AUROC。

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习在胎儿运动分析中具有潜力，为改善产前监测和临床决策铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: EditInfinity通过利用VQ生成模型的精确中间表示特性，实现了更准确的图像反演和高质量的文本驱动图像编辑，解决了扩散模型在图像反演中的根本限制。

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出大型视觉语言模型在长文本生成中更容易产生幻觉，并发现这并非由长度本身引起，而是由于长文本对上下文连贯性的依赖增加。作者提出了"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来主动管理幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时存在严重的幻觉问题，传统观点认为这是由于长度导致的错误累积，但作者质疑是否存在更深层的机制。

Method: 提出"诱导-检测-抑制"框架：通过精心设计的上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导实例进行早期高风险检测，并在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 该方法在所有基准测试中都取得了显著且一致的改进，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了有效的幻觉抑制方法，更重要的是重新验证了关于上下文依赖性的假设，为深入探索LVLMs长文本响应中的幻觉问题迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Conclusion: COS3D通过协作框架有效整合语言和分割线索，在开放词汇3D分割任务中取得了优异表现。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了DualGround双分支架构，通过分离全局和局部语义来改进视频时序定位任务，在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨模态注意力中统一处理所有文本标记，忽视了它们不同的语义角色，导致模型过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义而未能有效利用词级信号，限制了细粒度时序对齐能力。

Method: DualGround双分支架构：将[EOS]标记通过句子级路径处理，将词标记聚类为短语级单元进行局部定位；引入基于标记角色的跨模态交互策略和联合建模框架。

Result: 在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准测试中，DualGround在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 解耦语义建模在视频-语言对齐中是有效的，能够同时捕获粗粒度和局部语义，实现更具表达力和上下文感知的视频定位。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

Conclusion: 为推进跨视角地理定位研究提供了鲁棒的位置编码范例和上下文建模框架

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion

Abstract: Technologies like smartphones have become an essential in our daily lives. It
has made accessible to everyone including visually impaired individuals. With
the use of smartphone cameras, image capturing and processing have become more
convenient. With the use of smartphones and machine learning, the life of
visually impaired can be made a little easier. Daily tasks such as handling
money without relying on someone can be troublesome for them. For that purpose
this paper presents a real-time currency detection system designed to assist
visually impaired individuals. The proposed model is trained on a dataset
containing 30 classes of notes and coins, representing 3 types of currency: US
dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and Bangladeshi taka (BDT). Our approach uses a
YOLOv8 nano model with a custom detection head featuring deep convolutional
layers and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks to enhance feature extraction and
detection accuracy. Our model has achieved a higher accuracy of 97.73%, recall
of 95.23%, f1-score of 95.85% and a mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5

TL;DR: 提出GMFVAD方法，通过细粒度多模态特征减少视频异常检测中的冗余信息，提升检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态信息融合时处理粗糙，忽略了视频片段中可能存在的显著冗余信息

Method: 基于视频片段生成细粒度多模态特征，总结主要内容，并引入原始视频字幕的文本特征来增强视觉特征的突出部分

Result: 在四个主要数据集上实现了最先进的性能，消融实验验证了性能提升确实源于冗余信息的减少

Conclusion: GMFVAD通过细粒度多模态特征融合有效减少冗余信息，显著提升了视频异常检测性能

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

Conclusion: 提出的去偏见方法能够有效提升模型在视觉常识推理任务中的泛化能力，解决了数据集偏见问题。

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

Motivation: 传统数据驱动模型未能充分利用CV-SAR数据中丰富的电磁散射特征，而深度学习模型在数据有限和域偏移场景下面临泛化性、可解释性和效率之间的表示三难问题。

Method: 采用压缩-聚合-压缩架构：第一阶段进行物理引导压缩，通过新颖的字典处理器嵌入物理先验；中间聚合模块丰富表示；最后语义压缩阶段使用紧凑分类头和自蒸馏学习任务相关的判别性嵌入。

Result: 在五个SAR基准测试中，KINN的CNN（0.7M参数）和ViT（0.95M参数）变体都建立了参数高效识别的最先进水平，在数据稀缺和分布外场景下表现出优异的泛化能力和切实的可解释性。

Conclusion: KINN有效解决了表示三难问题，为SAR图像分析中的可信AI提供了新路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Conclusion: DMC³框架有效解决了第一人称视频问答中的特定挑战，通过反事实对比学习显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了Instruction-as-Reasoning范式，将指令视为动态分析路径，通过两阶段训练框架（SFT+RL）实现多视角推理和路径选择优化，在GUI grounding任务上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将指令视为用户意图的静态代理，忽略了指令多样性和质量对grounding性能的影响。研究发现现有数据集中23.3%的指令存在缺陷，利用指令多样性可在推理时带来76%的相对性能提升。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：1）在有监督微调阶段使用合成的多样化指令训练多视角推理能力；2）在强化学习阶段优化路径选择和组合。提出了UI-Ins-7B和UI-Ins-32B模型。

Result: 在五个挑战性grounding基准测试中取得SOTA：UI-I2E-Bench（87.3%）、ScreenSpot-Pro（57.0%）、MMBench-GUI L2（84.9%）。UI-Ins-7B在AndroidWorld上达到74.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: 提出的Instruction-as-Reasoning范式通过动态指令分析和路径选择显著提升了GUI grounding性能，同时避免了SFT+RL框架中的策略崩溃问题，展现了强大的代理潜力。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We
mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a

augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption
refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型需要极高的计算资源进行训练，主要原因是广泛使用的视觉编码器（如CLIP和SAM）缺乏与语言在多层次粒度上的对齐能力。

Method: 利用双曲空间固有的层次建模能力，通过可学习矩阵和Möbius乘法操作实现动态双曲半径调整，提供三种参数化策略：对角缩放矩阵、块对角矩阵和带状矩阵。

Result: 在多个MLLM基准测试上的综合实验表明，HyperET仅需增加不到1%的参数就能显著提升现有预训练和微调MLLM模型的性能。

Conclusion: HyperET为多模态大语言模型提供了一种高效且灵活的训练范式，能够有效弥合视觉和文本模态之间的粒度差距，显著降低计算资源需求。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Motivation: 解决基于深度学习的点云几何压缩中的泛化挑战，主要源于缺乏鲁棒的上下文模型和对OOD数据的低效处理。

Method: 1. 通用上下文模型：利用空间和通道分组先验捕获鲁棒上下文依赖；2. 实例自适应微调(IAFT)：结合显式和隐式压缩范式，为每个实例微调少量网络权重并纳入比特流。

Result: 在包含15个不同数据集的基准测试中，AnyPcc在点云压缩方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过通用上下文模型和IAFT策略有效解决了点云压缩中的泛化问题，为可复现研究提供了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Result: 在多个任务和扩散模型的标准基准测试中，AccuQuant表现出优异的效能和效率

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过模拟多步去噪过程有效缓解量化误差累积问题，为扩散模型的后训练量化提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

Conclusion: PE-Field使DiT能够在3D空间中直接建模几何，显著提升了视觉生成能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

Motivation: 现有图像到食谱检索方法假设食物图像能完全捕捉食谱的文本细节，但实际上图像只反映烹饪结果而非过程，导致表示学习偏向主导视觉元素，难以区分具有细微差异的相似食谱。

Method: 采用因果方法预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，并显式将这些元素注入跨模态表示学习，以缓解表示学习中的偏见。

Conclusion: 提出的因果表示学习方法有效解决了图像到食谱检索中的表示偏见问题，能够捕捉视觉不明显但对食谱检索至关重要的细节信息。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

<details>

Motivation: 当前多模态大推理模型存在两个关键局限：对简单查询使用计算昂贵的推理导致效率低下，以及专注于专业推理往往损害其更广泛的通用理解能力。

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在视频推理中的挑战：基于强化学习的方法产生未接地或幻觉结论，而帧检索方法在证据定位上不准确。

Method: 构建Conan-91K大规模自动生成推理轨迹数据集，设计多阶段渐进冷启动策略和识别-推理-行动强化学习训练框架，联合增强多步骤视觉推理。

Result: 在六个多步骤推理基准上，Conan平均准确率超过基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct 10%以上，达到最先进性能，并在长视频理解任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Conan框架有效解决了视频推理中的证据基础和推理准确性问题，具有强大的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)框架来解决可解释深度伪造分析中的细粒度感知不足问题，通过面部图像概念树和伪影定位解释任务，实现了更可靠的伪造解释。


<details>

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中缺乏细粒度感知能力，数据标注不可靠且粗粒度，模型无法输出文本伪造解释与视觉伪影证据之间的连接，也不支持任意面部区域的查询输入。

Method: 定义面部图像概念树(FICT)将面部图像划分为细粒度区域概念，构建FiFa-Annotator数据标注流程；提出伪影定位解释(AGE)任务，生成包含分割掩码的文本伪造解释；设计统一的多任务学习架构FiFa-MLLM，支持丰富的多模态输入输出。

Result: FiFa-MLLM在AGE任务上优于强基线模型，在现有XDFA数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过细粒度数据标注和统一多任务架构，有效解决了可解释深度伪造分析中的细粒度感知问题，为深度伪造检测提供了更可靠的可解释性。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

Motivation: 人脸分析系统的公平性评估依赖于自动人口属性推断，但现有方法的可靠性存在问题，这会影响公平性审计的有效性

Method: 采用模块化迁移学习方法，将预训练的人脸识别编码器与非线性分类头结合，替代传统的端到端训练

Conclusion: 这项工作为公平性审计中的人口属性推断提供了可靠基础，并公开了数据集元数据、代码库、预训练模型和评估工具包

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video是一个非代理框架，将显式时空证据整合到视频推理中，通过精心收集的训练数据和训练策略解决时空追踪和定位的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数视频推理模型只生成文本推理轨迹，而不指示关键证据出现的时间和位置。将证据中心推理扩展到视频更具挑战性，需要跨动态场景的联合时间追踪和空间定位。

Method: 构建两个高质量数据集STGR-CoT-30k和STGR-RL-36k，采用冷启动强化学习策略，设计多个专门奖励来共同鼓励答案准确性、时间对齐和空间精度。

Result: 在V-STAR基准测试中达到最先进性能，相比Qwen2.5-VL基线，mAM提高14.4%，mLGM提高24.2%。在多个视频理解基准测试中均观察到一致改进。

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video不仅提高了准确性，其生成的推理轨迹还为测试时扩展提供了有价值信号，实现了置信度感知验证并提高了答案可靠性。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoDistill是一个双向概念蒸馏框架，用于实现一步扩散个性化(1-SDP)，通过师生模型协同训练，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速个性化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一步扩散模型在个性化新概念方面能力有限，因为单步模型难以有效捕捉新概念的分布。需要一种方法能够在保持生成速度的同时实现有效的概念个性化。

Method: 提出双向概念蒸馏框架，同时训练多步扩散模型（教师）和一步扩散模型（学生）。通过概念从教师到学生的蒸馏，再从学生到教师的回传，结合对抗损失和对齐损失优化学生模型。

Result: 实验表明该协作框架在1-SDP设置下显著优于现有个性化方法，不仅提升了学生模型对新概念的个性化能力，还改善了教师模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: EchoDistill为T2I扩散模型中的快速有效个性化建立了新范式，通过双向蒸馏机制实现了速度与质量的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在跨域应用时性能急剧下降，无监督领域自适应可以避免新领域的高昂标注成本，但需要有效减少领域差异。

Method: 在嵌入空间中学习类别原型，引入相似性约束使原型具有代表性且类别间可分离；使用字典存储不同图像的原型，避免类别缺失问题并支持原型对比学习。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的基于相似性原型的框架在跨模态分割任务中表现出色，通过原型学习和对比学习有效解决了领域自适应问题。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理自由移动物体，提供全面而紧凑的物体覆盖，重建质量高且计算成本恒定。

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

open challenge. Such conditions are common in applications such as assistive
navigation for the visually impaired. These challenges undermine localization
accuracy and tracking stability, reducing navigation reliability and safety. To
overcome these limitations, we present SELM-SLAM3, a deep learning-enhanced
visual SLAM framework that integrates SuperPoint and LightGlue for robust
feature extraction and matching. We evaluated our framework using TUM RGB-D,
ICL-NUIM, and TartanAir datasets, which feature diverse and challenging
scenarios. SELM-SLAM3 outperforms conventional ORB-SLAM3 by an average of
87.84% and exceeds state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM systems by 36.77%. Our framework
demonstrates enhanced performance under challenging conditions, such as
low-texture scenes and fast motion, providing a reliable platform for
developing navigation aids for the visually impaired.

TL;DR: 提出了LDDBM框架，一种基于潜在变量扩散桥模型的通用模态转换方法，能够在共享潜在空间中学习任意模态间的转换，无需对齐维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在单模态领域表现出色，但在跨模态转换方面存在限制，需要共享维度、高斯先验等严格假设，缺乏通用性和理论基础。

Method: 在共享潜在空间中学习模态间的扩散桥，使用对比对齐损失确保语义一致性，设计领域无关的编码器-解码器架构进行潜在空间噪声预测，并引入预测损失指导跨域转换训练。

Result: 在多种模态转换任务中表现优异，包括多视图到3D形状生成、图像超分辨率和多视图场景合成，建立了通用模态转换的新强基线。

Conclusion: LDDBM提供了一个通用且理论严谨的模态转换框架，支持任意模态对，在多样化任务中展现出强大性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ACamera-Net，一种轻量级、场景自适应的相机参数调整网络，直接从RAW输入预测最佳曝光和白平衡，解决复杂光照条件下的图像质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消费级相机系统在复杂光照条件下（如低光、高动态范围、背光）难以保持稳定的图像质量，导致曝光不足、色偏和色调不一致，影响下游视觉任务的性能。

Method: 框架包含两个模块：ACamera-Exposure估计ISO以缓解曝光不足和对比度损失，ACamera-Color预测相关色温和增益因子以改善色彩一致性。针对边缘设备实时推理优化，可无缝集成到成像管道中。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据上训练，模型在不同光照条件下泛化良好。大量实验表明ACamera-Net持续提升图像质量并稳定感知输出，优于传统自动模式和轻量级基线方法。

Conclusion: ACamera-Net无需依赖额外的图像增强模块，就能有效解决复杂光照条件下的相机参数优化问题，提升图像质量和视觉任务性能。

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the
next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data,
model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在细粒度颜色可控性方面表现不佳，现有基准测试缺乏对颜色精度的系统评估，而颜色在视觉感知和实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 基于ISCC-NBS和CSS3/X11颜色系统构建基准测试，包含数值颜色表示，通过感知和自动化评估方法对流行文本到图像模型进行测试。

Result: 评估显示不同模型在颜色生成性能上存在显著差异，揭示了模型对不同颜色约定的理解程度和常见失败模式。

Conclusion: GenColorBench将为改进精确颜色生成提供指导，基准测试将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SeViCES框架，通过语义-视觉共识证据选择来解决长视频理解中的计算复杂性和推理不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临计算复杂、内容分散的挑战，现有方法忽视时间依赖或依赖单模态证据，无法提供完整且与查询相关的上下文。

Method: SeViCES包含两个关键组件：SVCFS模块通过时间感知语义分支和聚类引导视觉分支选择帧；ACR模块通过融合证据和约束答案空间来解决语义和视觉预测的不一致性。

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 共识驱动的证据选择对于视频大语言模型至关重要，SeViCES展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

TL;DR: BTB3D是一种因果卷积编码器-解码器，通过频率感知的体素标记化方法，在3D医学影像的视觉-语言建模中实现了更好的报告生成和文本到CT合成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理高分辨率、长序列3D医学影像时存在视觉编码器与临床语言不匹配、切片标记化模糊精细解剖结构等问题，导致下游任务诊断性能下降。

Method: 采用三阶段训练课程：(i)局部重建、(ii)重叠窗口平铺、(iii)长上下文解码器精炼，使用因果卷积编码器-解码器统一2D和3D训练推理，生成紧凑的频率感知体素标记。

Result: 在报告生成任务中，BLEU分数提升且临床F1比CT2Rep、CT-CHAT和Merlin提高40%；在文本到CT合成中，FID降低75%，FVD减半，生成解剖一致的512*512*241体积图像。

Conclusion: 精确的三维标记化（而非仅使用更大的语言骨干）对于3D医学影像中可扩展的视觉-语言建模至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高分辨率文本到图像生成的两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模高质量UHR数据集，以及忽视针对UHR场景的精细细节合成训练策略。

Method: 1) 构建UltraHR-100K数据集（10万张超过3K分辨率的图像）；2) 提出频率感知后训练方法，包括细节导向时间步采样(DOTS)和软加权频率正则化(SWFR)。

Result: 在提出的UltraHR-eval4K基准测试中，该方法显著提高了UHR图像生成的精细细节质量和整体保真度。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据集和训练策略有效提升了超高分辨率文本到图像生成的细节质量，为UHR T2I生成提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多比特量化网络的训练开销问题，通过权重偏置校正和比特级核心集采样实现了高效训练，同时保持模型性能

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV是一种新颖的KV缓存压缩方法，通过结合重要性和多样性来优化大型视觉语言模型中的KV缓存压缩，在极端压缩条件下显著提升多模态理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注保留高重要性KV对来最小化存储，但忽视了多模态KV缓存中出现的模态特定语义冗余模式，导致语义覆盖不足。

Method: MixKV方法适应头级语义冗余，在压缩KV对时选择性平衡多样性和重要性，通过混合重要性和多样性来优化KV缓存压缩。

Result: 在极端压缩（预算=64）条件下，MixKV将基线方法平均提升5.1%，在GUI接地任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别实现8.0%和9.0%的显著增益，同时保持相当的推理效率。

Conclusion: MixKV通过结合重要性和多样性有效解决了多模态KV缓存压缩中的语义覆盖问题，在保持效率的同时显著提升性能，并能无缝扩展到LLMs。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

TL;DR: AutoScape是一个长时域驾驶场景生成框架，通过RGB-D扩散模型迭代生成几何一致的关键帧，然后使用视频扩散模型进行插值，生成超过20秒的逼真且几何一致的驾驶视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时域驾驶场景生成中保持几何一致性的挑战，传统方法在长序列生成中容易出现几何不一致的问题。

Method: 1) 在共享潜在空间中联合处理图像和深度；2) 显式条件化先前生成关键帧的几何信息；3) 使用warp一致引导控制采样过程；4) 通过视频扩散模型在关键帧之间插值生成密集视频帧。

Result: 生成超过20秒的逼真驾驶视频，在长时域FID和FVD指标上分别比现有最佳方法提升48.6%和43.0%。

Conclusion: AutoScape通过几何一致的关键帧生成和插值方法，有效解决了长时域驾驶场景生成的几何一致性问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在超高分辨率训练时成本极高，因为自注意力机制随图像token数量呈二次方增长

Method: 利用扩散过程的光谱进展特性，在每一步动态调整位置编码，使其频率谱与当前生成阶段匹配

Result: 能够生成远超训练分辨率的图像（如使用FLUX生成1600万像素图像），在多个基准测试中持续提升性能，在超高分辨率图像生成中达到最先进的保真度

Conclusion: DyPE在超高分辨率图像生成方面实现了突破性进展，且增益随分辨率提高而更加显著

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现MeanFlow目标自然分解为轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性两个部分，这两个项存在强负相关性，导致优化冲突和收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出α-Flow目标族，统一了轨迹流匹配、Shortcut Model和MeanFlow，采用课程学习策略平滑地从轨迹流匹配过渡到MeanFlow。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，α-Flow始终优于MeanFlow，α-Flow-XL/2+模型使用普通DiT骨干网络取得了FID 2.58(1-NFE)和2.15(2-NFE)的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: α-Flow通过解耦目标冲突和课程学习策略，有效解决了MeanFlow的优化问题，在少步生成建模中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Motivation: 从单张2D图像准确推断相机姿态、3D形状和纹理是计算机视觉中的关键挑战，现有方法在姿态估计和形状重建的联合优化方面存在局限。

Method: 将3D重建建模为条件采样过程，采用两阶段流匹配：粗阶段生成初始几何和2D投影用于姿态恢复，精阶段集成姿态对齐图像特征以增强结构保真度和外观细节。

Result: 在PSNR上获得超过3dB增益，Chamfer距离减少超过10%，在姿态精度上与单目估计器相当，在视觉保真度上优于基线3D生成模型。

Conclusion: Cupid通过统一的生成框架实现了鲁棒的姿态和形状估计，在单图像3D重建任务中表现出色。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究往往低估雷达的作用，仅将其作为辅助传感器，而雷达能够提供目标在3D世界坐标系中的精确距离/深度信息。本文旨在充分发挥雷达的关键作用，减少人工干预。

Method: 开发雷达-相机融合MOT框架，利用在线雷达-相机标定简化传感器检测结果集成；使用雷达和相机数据的共同特征准确推导检测对象的真实世界位置；采用特征匹配和类别一致性检查超越单纯位置匹配的限制。

Result: 在受控环境和实际交通场景中的实验证明，该框架能够简化雷达-相机映射过程并提高跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 这是首个研究雷达-相机共同特征集成及其在在线标定中用于实现MOT的工作，展示了框架在简化传感器映射和提高跟踪精度方面的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出ARGenSeg框架，通过图像生成方式实现分割，将多模态理解与像素级感知统一，显著提升推理速度并保持强大理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用边界点表示或专用分割头，依赖离散表示或语义提示，限制了MLLM捕捉细粒度视觉细节的能力。

Method: 基于图像生成的分割框架，利用MLLM输出视觉token，通过通用VQ-VAE解码为图像，采用下一尺度预测策略并行生成视觉token。

Result: 在多个分割数据集上超越先前最先进方法，推理速度显著提升。

Conclusion: ARGenSeg成功将分割任务整合到MLLM中，实现了多模态理解与像素级感知的统一，为视觉语言模型提供了新的分割范式。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Motivation: 受自回归大语言模型启发，将Transformer应用于视频预测领域，特别关注物理模拟的时间因果建模，这是现有视频生成方法的常见短板。

Method: 使用纯Transformer架构，比较不同时空自注意力布局，采用连续像素空间表示进行自回归视频预测，无需复杂训练策略或潜在特征学习组件。

Result: 在物理模拟数据集上，相比现有潜在空间方法，物理准确预测的时间范围延长了50%，同时在常见视频质量指标上保持可比性能。通过可解释性实验发现网络能够准确估计PDE模拟参数。

Conclusion: 该工作为基于注意力的时空视频建模提供了一个简单、参数高效且可解释的平台。

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性，且在MSI波段很少时容易失败。需要一种既能保持性能又具有可解释性的方法。

Method: 采用物理引导的自监督融合框架，强制实施解混瓶颈：从低分辨率HSI提取端元特征，用多层感知机从MSI预测丰度图，通过线性混合重建光谱。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SpectraMorph始终优于最先进的无监督/自监督基线方法，与监督基线方法相比也很有竞争力。

Conclusion: SpectraMorph产生可解释的中间结果，训练时间不到一分钟，即使在单波段MSI情况下也能保持稳健性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型缺乏对空间组合的交互控制，且难以扩展到多个主体。

Method: 引入分层画布表示（每个主体在独立层）和锁定机制（保持选定层高保真度，其他层灵活适应上下文），无需架构更改，使用位置嵌入和互补数据采样策略。

Result: 在多个主体个性化图像生成中，相比最先进方法实现了更优的空间控制和身份保持。

Conclusion: LayerComposer通过直观的分层操作提供了专业级图像编辑体验，在空间控制和多主体生成方面表现卓越。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

Motivation: 解决现有文本到视频模型在生成连贯、多镜头叙事方面的不足，填补"叙事鸿沟"，使端到端的电影创作成为可能。

Method: 采用窗口交叉注意力机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，以及稀疏的镜头间自注意力模式（镜头内密集、镜头间稀疏），确保分钟级生成的效率。

Result: 在叙事连贯性方面达到了新的最先进水平，并展现出对角色和场景的持久记忆以及对电影技术的直观理解等新兴能力。

Conclusion: HoloCine标志着从剪辑合成向自动化电影制作的关键转变，使端到端的电影创作成为可实现的未来。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

Motivation: QUBO问题在数学上等价于寻找伊辛自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态，需要高效算法来解决这类组合优化问题。

Method: 使用矩阵乘积态紧凑表示自旋构型，结合驱动哈密顿量和问题哈密顿量，通过DMRG方法迭代最小化系统能量。

Conclusion: 该量子启发方法具有可扩展性、通用性和适用于工业规模QUBO应用的优势。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

Motivation: 当前AI在能源领域的应用缺乏标准化框架来评估系统推理的正确性，现有验证方法主要关注预测准确性或计算效率，而忽视分析结论的逻辑完整性。

Method: 开发了包含五个子指标（准确性、推理可靠性、不确定性纪律、政策一致性和透明度）的ARB框架，使用公开技术经济数据集，在相同事实和监管条件下测试四个前沿模型。

Result: GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5 Sonnet实现了稳定且符合政策的推理（分析可靠性指数大于90），Gemini 2.5 Pro表现中等，Llama 3 70B未达到专业阈值。统计验证确认这些差异显著且可重现。

Conclusion: ARB建立了能源文献中首个验证AI系统中因果、概率和政策驱动推理的定量方法，为全球能源转型中可信透明分析应用提供了参考框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中，任务成功率达到35.8%，执行时间相比最先进方法减少高达40.4%。

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是一个可靠且高效的基于LLM的网页代理框架，在推理能力和执行效率方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

*Yuanhe Zhang,Ilja Kuzborskij,Jason D. Lee,Chenlei Leng,Fanghui Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于有向无环图(DAG)的CoT建模框架，引入逻辑紧密度指标评估LLM推理一致性，发现即使PASS@k指标相似，不同LLM在规则一致性推理上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT方法虽然提升数学问题解决能力，但不清楚其成功是源于搜索、记忆还是真正的规则一致性推理，需要更精确的评估框架。

Method: 将CoT建模为基于规则的随机过程，使用DAG表示推导状态和规则应用，提出DAG-MATH CoT格式和逻辑紧密度指标来量化推理一致性。

Result: 在标准数学推理数据集上，发现不同LLM家族在推理保真度上存在统计显著差异，即使最终答案准确率相似，揭示了答案准确性与规则一致性推导之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该框架在自由形式CoT和形式证明系统之间提供了平衡，为LLM推理评估提供了可操作的诊断工具，有助于更深入地理解LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available
at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统依赖环境特定接口，限制了跨平台部署能力，需要构建能够跨Web、桌面和移动环境泛化的智能体。

Method: 集成了分层上下文管理、解耦的规划与执行、以及具有自适应恢复能力的自我验证机制，支持长任务序列的可靠操作。

Result: 在WebVoyager上达到97.1%准确率，WebArena 69.6%，OSWorld 60.1%，AndroidWorld 87.1%，超越所有先前系统，多次尝试后在所有基准测试中超过人类表现。

Conclusion: 系统化编排能够放大基础模型能力，实现仅通过视觉交互的通用计算机控制，但需要下一代视觉语言模型来实现帕累托最优的成本效益。

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments
remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific
interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a
unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates
hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and
self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long
task horizons. Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on
WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior
systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2
exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables
general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while
calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal
cost-efficiency.

TL;DR: RELATE是一个模式无关的图神经网络特征编码器，使用共享的模态特定编码器和交叉注意力模块，在保持性能的同时大幅减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络需要为每种节点类型和特征列设计单独的特征编码器，这阻碍了可扩展性和参数共享。

Method: 使用共享的模态特定编码器处理分类、数值、文本和时间属性，然后通过Perceiver风格的交叉注意力模块将特征聚合成固定大小的节点表示。

Result: 在RelBench基准测试中，RELATE达到了模式特定编码器97%的性能，同时将参数数量减少了5倍。

Conclusion: RELATE支持不同的数据模式，为关系图数据的通用GNN预训练奠定了基础。

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

TL;DR: 生成式AI正在加剧保险欺诈，使大规模快速伪造事故证据成为可能。保险公司采用AI检测工具对抗，但存在误报漏报问题，形成猫鼠游戏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保险欺诈每年造成数百亿美元损失，传统欺诈手段包括伪造事故、夸大损失等。生成式AI的出现让欺诈者能轻松制造逼真的事故照片和文件，需要新的检测方案。

Method: 保险公司部署基于AI的深度伪造检测软件和增强验证流程，但面临误报漏报和欺诈者不断适应的问题。

Result: 当前检测工具存在局限性，欺诈者持续调整策略规避检测，形成技术军备竞赛。

Conclusion: 对抗AI驱动的保险欺诈仍是持续挑战，需要更先进的解决方案来检测、缓解和威慑这种新型欺诈浪潮。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

Method: 从129名硕士生收集5个领导力人格测试的23个特征数据，结合平均成绩，使用Pearson相关性进行特征选择，调优7种机器学习算法（SVM、LR、KNN、DT、GB、RF、XGBoost、LightGBM）。

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，包含17个人格特征和领导力标记特征的模型准确率达87.50%，不包含该特征的模型准确率达85.71%。

Conclusion: 该研究为教育过程中早期识别学生优缺点和选择最合适的个性化学习策略提供了额外机会，证明了领导力人格特质在预测学术成功方面的有效性。

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment

deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial

Motivation: 当前金融取证系统缺乏透明度和可解释性，非专家用户难以理解和信任检测结果。需要开发能够提供自然语言交互和上下文解释的系统，提高金融取证的可信度。

Method: 系统采用多智能体架构，包含解析、检测和解释三个角色。使用XGBoost作为基础检测器，通过开源Web UI实现用户意图到检测模式的转换，并生成基于底层特征的叙述性解释。

Result: 在标记的比特币混币数据集（Wasabi Wallet，2020-2024）上，基线检测器达到了较高的准确率，而HCLA系统在此基础上增加了可解释性和交互式优化能力。

Conclusion: 人机协同设计能够显著提高金融取证系统的透明度和信任度，HCLA系统展示了如何通过自然语言交互和上下文感知解释来增强非专家用户对异常检测结果的理解和信任。

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,

questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a

TL;DR: 论文认为需要重新评估AI在法律实践中的应用，提出了验证-价值悖论：AI提高效率的同时需要更多人工验证，导致净价值往往可以忽略不计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对律师因提交不准确的AI生成内容而受处罚的案例，认为现有AI应用范式需要重新审视，考虑AI与现实脱节、缺乏透明度以及律师的核心职责。

Method: 提出替代性的AI应用模型，即验证-价值悖论，分析AI在法律实践中效率提升与验证需求之间的平衡关系。

Result: 验证-价值悖论表明，AI带来的效率提升会被相应增加的验证需求所抵消，导致AI使用的净价值对律师而言往往可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: 论文阐述了该悖论对法律实践和法律教育的影响，强调应基于对真相的忠诚和公民责任来指导AI的使用。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

TL;DR: 提出了TRUST框架，一个去中心化的大语言模型推理审计系统，通过共识机制、层次化DAG分解、区块链账本和隐私保护分段技术，解决了集中式审计的鲁棒性、可扩展性、透明度和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型审计方法存在集中化、不透明、难以扩展的问题，在关键领域部署专有模型时存在重大风险，需要解决鲁棒性、可扩展性、透明度和隐私四个核心挑战。

Method: TRUST框架采用：1) 多样化审计员共识机制，可容忍30%恶意参与者；2) 层次化DAG推理轨迹分解，实现可扩展并行审计；3) 区块链账本记录验证决策；4) 隐私保护分段技术，仅共享部分推理步骤。

Result: 在多个大语言模型（GPT-OSS、DeepSeek-r1、Qwen）和推理任务（数学、医疗、科学、人文）上的实验表明，TRUST能有效检测推理缺陷，并对抗性审计员保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRUST框架开创了去中心化AI审计的先河，为大语言模型的安全可信部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类发展类比，假设AGI进步需要从开放模仿转向身份巩固阶段，这是实现AGI级可靠性和安全性的关键控制点。

Method: 形式化这一阶段，将其与学习动力学现象联系起来，并提出操作性指标进行检测。通过实验验证行为巩固的快速非线性特征及其对通用能力的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示结果呈谱系分布：小模型出现性能权衡，中等规模模型几乎无成本采用，大型量化模型出现瞬态不稳定性。

Conclusion: 身份巩固是AGI可靠性的先决条件，也是安全性的关键控制点：身份可以被有意设计以提高可靠性，也可能在扩展过程中自发出现，从而固化不可预测的目标和行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

Motivation: 优化AI在动态环境中的性能是机器学习研究的基本挑战，2048游戏结合了策略游戏和随机元素，是研究决策制定、长期规划和动态适应的理想平台。

Method: 实现两种系统：双智能体元提示系统（思考者LLM优化执行者LLM的策略）和单智能体系统（基于有限蒙特卡洛树搜索的价值函数优化），并实验回滚功能以避免性能下降。

Result: 单智能体系统取得显著改进，每个周期平均增加473.2分，训练周期呈明显上升趋势（相关性ρ=0.607），LLM对游戏的理解也随着高级策略的发展而增长；双智能体系统改进有限。

Conclusion: 进化优化技术在非确定性环境中提升AI性能具有潜力，但元提示方法存在固有局限性。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM能够模仿表面的人类行为，但其模拟更深层次个性化认知过程的能力尚不清楚。研究旨在评估不同认知表征方法在ICS中的效果，为开发适应个体思维方式的AI系统奠定基础。

Method: 构建了基于新出版小说（晚于测试LLM发布日期）的数据集，提出了11条件认知评估框架，测试了7个现成LLM在作者风格模仿任务中的表现，比较了语言特征、概念映射和基于档案信息等不同认知表征方法。

Result: 结果显示结合概念和语言特征的方法在ICS中特别有效，在整体评估中优于基于静态档案的线索。LLM在模仿语言风格方面比模仿叙事结构更有效，突显了其在深层认知模拟方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发适应个体思维和表达方式的AI系统提供了基础，推动了更个性化和人类对齐的创意技术的发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

### [106] [Using Large Language Models for Abstraction of Planning Domains - Extended Version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20258)
*Bita Banihashemi,Megh Patel,Yves Lespérance*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型通过上下文学习生成抽象的PDDL领域和问题实例，以自然语言指定的抽象目标为基础，验证了GPT-4o在简单场景下能有效合成规划领域抽象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态领域抽象的选择会影响智能体的规划、推理和解释能力，因此需要开发能够根据自然语言目标自动生成抽象PDDL领域的方法。

Method: 在PDDL中建模智能体具体行为，利用大型语言模型的上下文学习能力生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例，并通过符号验证工具和专家评估进行验证。

Result: GPT-4o在简单设置下通常能合成有用的规划领域抽象，但在抽象动作方面表现优于抽象相关谓词。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能够有效支持规划领域的抽象生成，特别是在动作抽象方面表现出色，为自动化领域抽象提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

*Yunzhi Liu,Haokai Tan,Rushi Kanjaria,Lihuan Li,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了STaBERT模型，通过整合POI信息和时间描述符来增强人类移动性预测的语义理解，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型要么只建模位置序列，要么仅将时间信息作为辅助输入，未能充分利用兴趣点(POI)提供的丰富语义上下文。

Method: 在BERT移动性模型基础上，引入推导的时间描述符和POI嵌入，构建统一的语义增强移动性表示。

Result: 单城市预测的GEO-BLEU得分从0.34提升到0.75；多城市预测从0.34提升到0.56。

Conclusion: STaBERT通过整合POI和时间信息，显著改善了人类移动性预测的准确性。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

TL;DR: ToolEQA是一个集成外部工具和多步推理的EQA智能体，通过工具获取有用信息来指导探索方向，在更短探索距离内生成更准确回答，并在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EQA方法直接使用VLM探索环境而不进行显式思考或规划，限制了推理能力，导致探索效率低下和回答效果不佳。

Method: 提出ToolEQA智能体，集成外部工具进行多步推理；设计自动生成EQA任务的数据管道，收集包含18K任务的EQA-RT数据集。

Result: 在EQA-RT-Seen和EQA-RT-Unseen测试集上，ToolEQA比最先进基线方法成功率提高9.2~20.2%，比零样本ToolEQA提高10%；在HM-EQA、OpenEQA和EXPRESS-Bench数据集上也达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ToolEQA通过集成外部工具和多步推理显著提升了EQA任务的性能，证明了其有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文分析了AI在医疗保健应用中数据收集阶段的偏见问题，基于AI4HealthyAging项目的实践经验，识别了历史偏见、代表性偏见和测量偏见等多种偏见类型，并提出了改进临床问题设计和数据收集的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在医疗保健领域具有巨大潜力，但由于训练数据的质量和公平性问题，AI解决方案在真实临床实践中的整合仍然有限。主要障碍是数据收集实践中的偏见问题。

Method: 基于西班牙国家研发计划中的AI4HealthyAging项目实践经验，通过检测临床数据收集过程中的偏见，识别了多种偏见类型在不同用例中的表现。

Result: 识别出在性别、年龄、居住环境、社会经济状况、设备和标签等多个变量中存在的历史偏见、代表性偏见和测量偏见。

Conclusion: 提出了改进临床问题设计和数据收集的实用建议，旨在提高医疗AI系统的公平性和鲁棒性，为未来开发更公平的医疗AI系统提供指导。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Conclusion: 该模型为评估军事行动中打击AI系统产生的效果提供了透明推理机制，有助于建立负责任的智能系统。

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

TL;DR: 本调查系统回顾了LLM赋能知识图谱构建的最新进展，分析了LLM如何重塑本体工程、知识抽取和知识融合这三个经典层次的传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的出现，知识图谱构建正从基于规则和统计的流程转向语言驱动和生成框架，需要系统梳理这一范式转变。

Method: 从两个互补视角回顾新兴的LLM驱动方法：强调结构、规范化和一致性的基于模式范式，以及强调灵活性、适应性和开放发现的免模式范式。

Result: 系统综合了各阶段的代表性框架，分析了技术机制并识别了局限性，为理解LLM与知识图谱的演进互动提供了清晰框架。

Conclusion: 该调查旨在澄清LLM与知识图谱之间的演进关系，桥接符号知识工程和神经语义理解，推动自适应、可解释和智能知识系统的发展。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

TL;DR: 提出了IKnow框架，通过指令-响应对话格式的自监督目标，在不依赖外部资源的情况下实现语言模型的持续预训练，避免语义表示退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决指令调优模型在持续预训练时语义表示退化和指令跟随能力下降的问题，同时克服现有方法需要原始基础模型或外部知识库的限制。

Method: IKnow框架利用文本中嵌入的领域知识，通过指令-响应对话格式设计自监督目标，在更深语义层次编码知识。

Result: 论文提出了一个简单通用的框架，能够在没有外部资源的情况下有效进行持续预训练。

Conclusion: IKnow为在受限环境下（无法获取基础模型权重或可靠外部语料库）的语言模型持续适应提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

Method: 开发了包含五个功能模块的计算模型，这些功能基于创造力理论和技巧，旨在生成既新颖又有用的创新机会。

Result: 在酒店业创新项目评估中，该模型生成的机会比Notebook LM和ChatGPT4o更具新颖性和/或实用性，但并非所有功能模块都对提升新颖性有贡献。

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EBR的新型神经推理器，使用嵌入来近似符号推理器的结果，解决了传统描述逻辑推理器对不一致和错误数据不鲁棒的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经符号概念学习方法大多依赖描述逻辑推理器，但这些推理器对知识库中的不一致和错误数据不鲁棒，限制了在实际知识库中的应用。

Method: EBR推理器基于嵌入技术，仅需检索原子概念和存在限制的实例，就能检索或近似描述逻辑SHOIQ中任何概念的实例集合。

Result: 实验表明，与最先进的推理器相比，EBR对缺失和错误数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EBR为在现实世界知识库中部署概念学习提供了一种鲁棒的神经推理解决方案。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱对齐方法主要关注实体级对齐，缺乏可解释性推理且需要训练数据。

Method: 基于模糊逻辑的无监督方法，迭代式提供实体和关系的整体对齐，支持悬空实体处理。

Result: 在主要基准测试中达到最先进结果，方法可证明收敛。

Conclusion: FLORA是一种简单有效的知识图谱对齐方法，具有无监督、可解释、收敛性好等优势。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨政府在AI治理中如何征求公众意见，以及这些意见是否真正影响了政策制定，以解决公众与政策制定者之间缺乏有效对话的问题。

Method: 采用景观分析方法，比较了三个国家（澳大利亚、哥伦比亚、美国）政府征求AI风险和政策反馈的方式，以及这些反馈是否影响了治理决策。

Result: 研究发现三个国家的公众参与度均低于人口的1%，政府未能吸引多样化声音，对收到的反馈回应有限，未能建立有效的反馈循环。

Conclusion: 当前参与式AI治理方法难以建立信任或合法性，因为政策制定者未能充分倾听和回应公众关切。作者提出了八项改进建议，包括提升AI素养、扩大参与范围、使用创新参与方法等。

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

Conclusion: 该方法在大规模系统的拓扑和跨系统泛化方面向近实时网络拓扑优化迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法只关注最终答案正确性，忽略了推理过程质量，无法为模型改进提供细粒度信号。

Method: 引入CaSE评估框架，将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，使用前文语境评估每个推理步骤，避免后见之明偏差。

Result: 在MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH基准上验证了CaSE与人工标注的一致性，通过CaSE筛选训练数据能直接提升最终任务性能。

Conclusion: CaSE为分析、调试和改进LLM推理提供了可扩展框架，证明了超越有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

Motivation: 随机游走中心性是图挖掘中量化节点重要性的基本指标，但现有方法计算成本高，无法应用于大型网络。

Method: 提出随机游走中心性的新公式化，开发两种算法：近似Cholesky分解与稀疏逆估计方法，以及根生成树采样方法。

Result: 在大型真实网络（包括超过1000万个节点的网络）上的实验证明了所提算法的效率和近似质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够高效计算随机游走中心性，解决了现有方法在大规模网络中的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

Result: 构建了包含6个类别37个任务的综合基准，其中8个多模态任务，覆盖7种语言（包括5种东南亚低资源语言），反映了真实商业交互的噪声和异质性。

Conclusion: EcomEval填补了电子商务领域评估基准的空白，提供了挑战导向和细粒度评估工具，支持多语言和多模态场景的全面评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

*Eric Ngoiya,Tianshu Bao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Fluidity Index (FI)来量化模型在动态扩展环境中的适应性，评估模型对初始、当前和未来环境状态变化的响应准确性，重点关注上下文切换和连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种方法来评估模型在动态扩展环境中的适应性，特别是区分封闭式和开放式基准测试，优先考虑现实世界的闭环开放式基准来测试适应性。

Method: 通过测量模型在扩展环境中理解、预测和适应状态变化的能力来评估适应性，特别强调至少需要二阶适应性以实现自我维持计算。

Result: 开发了Fluidity Index (FI)基准，能够量化模型在动态环境中的适应性表现。

Conclusion: 真正超级智能的模型应至少具备二阶适应性，通过数字补充实现自我维持计算以达到最佳流动性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

TL;DR: 本文对将机器学习集成到理性智能体架构中的现有方法进行了细粒度系统化分析，以BDI范式为参考框架，识别了关键研究机遇和开放挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于机器学习在感知和认知任务中展现出类人能力，将其集成到理性智能体架构中的框架日益受到关注，但现有研究零散且不连贯，往往忽视理性架构的表达能力。

Method: 使用BDI（信念-欲望-意图）范式作为参考框架，对现有方法进行细粒度系统化分析。

Result: 分析展示了由机器学习增强的理性智能体文献的快速发展，识别了关键研究机会。

Conclusion: 为设计有效的理性机器学习智能体提出了开放挑战和研究方向。

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)
models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within
rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains
fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent
containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational
architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper
presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI
paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature
on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities
and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

### [124] [The Shape of Reasoning: Topological Analysis of Reasoning Traces in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20665)
*Xue Wen Tan,Nathaniel Tan,Galen Lee,Stanley Kok*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于拓扑数据分析的评估框架，用于自动评估大语言模型推理轨迹的质量，相比传统图指标具有更强的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型推理轨迹质量的方法依赖专家标准、人工标注和缓慢的成对判断，自动化方法主要使用图结构代理指标，但无法准确捕捉高质量推理的本质特征。

Method: 引入拓扑数据分析框架，捕捉推理轨迹的几何结构，实现标签高效的自动化评估。

Result: 拓扑特征在评估推理质量方面比标准图指标具有显著更高的预测能力，表明有效推理更适合用高维几何结构而非纯关系图来捕捉。

Conclusion: 紧凑稳定的拓扑特征集能可靠指示轨迹质量，为未来强化学习算法提供了实用的信号。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

*Yanlin Song,Ben Liu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiwei Hu,Qianqian Xie,Min Peng,Sophia Ananiadou,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Graph-RFT是一个两阶段强化微调的KGQA框架，通过'规划-KG搜索-网络搜索-思考'范式，使LLM能够在知识不完整条件下自主规划并自适应调度KG和网络检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA方法难以充分利用KG的丰富知识和LLM的推理能力，特别是在复杂场景中。它们通常假设KG覆盖完整，缺乏判断何时需要外部信息的机制，且推理过程局部短视，无法维持连贯的多步规划。

Method: Graph-RFT采用两阶段方法：1）使用定制化规划-检索数据集进行思维链微调，激活结构化推理；2）引入规划-检索引导的强化学习过程，整合显式规划和检索动作，采用笛卡尔式规划模块分解复杂问题，使用逻辑表达式指导工具调用。

Result: 该方法通过多奖励设计优化推理检索过程，结合结果和检索特定信号，使模型能够学习何时以及如何有效结合KG和网络检索。

Conclusion: Graph-RFT解决了GRPO冷启动问题，实现了覆盖感知的检索调度和全局一致的多步推理，提升了在知识不完整条件下的KGQA性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

### [126] [A Coherence-Based Measure of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20784)
*Fares Fourati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于广义均值积分的一致性感知AGI度量方法，替代仅使用算术平均值的定义，能更好地反映跨认知领域的平衡能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AGI定义使用算术平均值，假设领域间可补偿性，但真正的通用智能应体现跨所有必要领域的一致充分性。

Method: 基于广义均值在补偿性指数连续统上的积分，形成曲线下面积(AUC)度量，涵盖算术、几何和调和均值机制。

Result: 应用于GPT-4和GPT-5的CHC领域得分，一致性调整的AUC显示两者距离通用能力仍很远，尽管算术得分较高(GPT-5约24%)。

Conclusion: 整合广义均值提供了原则性、可解释且更严格的AGI进展测量基础，惩罚不平衡并捕捉领域间依赖性。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over
10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to
stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and
the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this
challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable
of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends,
uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.
