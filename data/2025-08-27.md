*Zekun Ni,Jonathan Weyn,Hang Zhang,Yanfei Xiang,Jiang Bian,Weixin Jin,Kit Thambiratnam,Qi Zhang,Haiyu Dong,Hongyu Sun*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: Huracan是首个基于观测数据的端到端集合天气预报系统，无需依赖传统数值天气预报的初始条件，在精度上可与最先进的ECMWF ENS系统相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习天气预报模型仍依赖传统数值天气预报的初始条件，限制了预报能力。需要开发完全基于观测数据的端到端系统来突破这一限制。

Method: 结合集合数据同化模型和预报模型，仅使用观测数据作为输入，生成集合初始条件和端到端集合天气预报。

Result: Huracan在75.4%的变量和预报时效组合上达到或超过ECMWF ENS的连续排序概率评分，使用更少的观测数据实现了可比精度。

Conclusion: 这是端到端数据驱动天气预报的重要进展，为改进和革新业务天气预报开辟了新机遇。

Abstract: Over the past few years, machine learning-based data-driven weather
prediction has been transforming operational weather forecasting by providing
more accurate forecasts while using a mere fraction of computing power compared
to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP). However, those models still
rely on initial conditions from NWP, putting an upper limit on their forecast
abilities. A few end-to-end systems have since been proposed, but they have yet
to match the forecast skill of state-of-the-art NWP competitors. In this work,
we propose Huracan, an observation-driven weather forecasting system which
combines an ensemble data assimilation model with a forecast model to produce
highly accurate forecasts relying only on observations as inputs. Huracan is
not only the first to provide ensemble initial conditions and end-to-end
ensemble weather forecasts, but also the first end-to-end system to achieve an
accuracy comparable with that of ECMWF ENS, the state-of-the-art NWP
competitor, despite using a smaller amount of available observation data.
Notably, Huracan matches or exceeds the continuous ranked probability score of
ECMWF ENS on 75.4% of the variable and lead time combinations. Our work is a
major step forward in end-to-end data-driven weather prediction and opens up
opportunities for further improving and revolutionizing operational weather
forecasting.

### [3] [Towards Training-Free Underwater 3D Object Detection from Sonar Point Clouds: A Comparison of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18293)
*M. Salman Shaukat,Yannik Käckenmeister,Sebastian Bader,Thomas Kirste*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了两种无需真实训练数据的水下3D目标检测方法：基于物理的声纳模拟训练神经网络和基于模板匹配的几何方法。在真实数据测试中，模板匹配方法表现更优，达到83% mAP，而神经网络方法因域偏移问题性能下降至40% mAP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下3D目标检测中真实标注数据获取困难且成本高昂的问题，探索无需真实训练数据的可靠检测方法。

Method: 开发了两种范式：1）基于物理的声纳模拟管道生成合成训练数据用于训练最先进的神经网络；2）基于模型的模板匹配系统，利用目标物体的几何先验知识。

Result: 在波罗的海真实测深数据评估中：神经网络在模拟场景达到98% mAP，但在真实声纳数据上降至40% mAP；模板匹配方法无需训练即可在真实数据上保持83% mAP，对声学噪声和环境变化表现出显著鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了水下领域数据密集型深度学习的传统观念，建立了首个大规模无训练水下3D检测基准，为数据稀缺环境下的自主水下航行器导航、海洋考古和海上基础设施监测开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

### [4] [MobileDenseAttn:A Dual-Stream Architecture for Accurate and Interpretable Brain Tumor Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18294)
*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobileDenseAttn是一种融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流模型，用于脑肿瘤MRI检测，在6020个MRI扫描数据集上达到98.35%的测试准确率，比基线模型准确率提高3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%，并通过GradCAM提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脑肿瘤MRI检测方法存在泛化能力有限、计算效率低、缺乏可解释性和透明度等问题，限制了临床可信度。需要开发一种通用、高效且可解释的模型来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出MobileDenseAttn融合模型，结合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流架构，采用特征级融合方法。在包含6020个MRI扫描（胶质瘤、脑膜瘤、垂体瘤和正常样本）的增强数据集上进行训练，使用严格的5折交叉验证协议。

Result: 模型训练准确率99.75%，测试准确率98.35%，F1分数0.9835（95% CI: 0.9743-0.9920）。相比基线模型VGG19，准确率提高3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%。GradCAM热图清晰显示肿瘤区域，提供临床显著定位。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn被定位为高效、高性能、可解释的模型，具有成为临床实用工具的潜力，能够在真实世界中有效识别脑肿瘤。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [5] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在多模态基础方面存在系统性缺陷，当通过视觉而非文本引用实体时，模型回忆事实知识的能力显著下降，图像表示使事实回忆能力减半。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别视觉语言模型在多模态基础中的系统性缺陷，特别是模型在将内部知识与图像表示链接方面的困难。

Method: 通过对照研究分析VLMs的表现差异，使用模型内部状态模式构建探测工具来识别不可靠响应，并在视觉问答任务中应用选择性预测。

Result: 探测工具在标记不可靠VLM响应方面达到92%以上的准确率，在视觉问答任务中将覆盖率提高7.87%，同时将错误风险降低0.9%。

Conclusion: VLMs存在可检测的系统性缺陷，内部状态探测可有效识别模型失败情况，这为语言基础研究提供了重要方向和改进建议。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义感知的神经重建方法，从稀疏图像生成高保真3D模型，通过添加基于patch的语义logits来丰富神经隐式表示，并引入基于几何基元掩码的正则化来缓解形状模糊性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏图像输入中由于特征不匹配导致的严重辐射模糊问题，提升稀疏条件下的3D重建质量。

Method: 在符号距离场和辐射场的基础上优化添加patch-based语义logits，引入基于几何基元掩码的新型正则化方法来减轻形状模糊。

Result: 在DTU数据集上，相比SparseNeuS和VolRecon分别减少44%和20%的平均倒角距离；作为NeuS和Neuralangelo等密集重建基线的插件时，平均误差分别减少69%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏图像重建中的辐射模糊问题，显著提升了重建精度，可作为现有密集重建方法的有效补充。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究使用轻量级深度学习模型和集成方法，在AerialWaste数据集上实现了92.33%的非法垃圾填埋场检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法垃圾填埋场对全球构成严重威胁，但人工识别困难且缺乏高质量公开数据集。需要开发高效的自动检测方法来节省时间和资源。

Method: 使用Mobilenetv2、Googlenet、Densenet、MobileVit等轻量级深度学习模型，避免过拟合问题，并采用集成融合技术结合最佳模型。

Result: 集成模型在二进制分类任务中取得了92.33%准确率、92.67%精确率、92.33%灵敏度、92.41% F1分数和92.71%特异性的优异性能。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型结合集成技术能有效解决非法垃圾填埋场检测问题，在AerialWaste数据集上表现出色，为环境监测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSU是一个新颖的多模态情感分析框架，通过整合模态特定结构信息和跨模态语义对齐来提升多模态表示质量，在性能和计算效率方面都优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态融合方法往往忽视模态特定的结构依赖和语义错位问题，限制了模型的质量、可解释性和鲁棒性

Method: 提出结构-语义统一器(SSU)框架：1)动态构建模态特定图(文本使用语言语法，音视频使用轻量级文本引导注意力机制)；2)引入基于全局文本语义的语义锚点作为跨模态对齐中心；3)开发多视图对比学习目标

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI基准数据集上 consistently 达到最先进性能，同时显著降低计算开销

Conclusion: SSU框架有效解决了多模态情感分析中的结构依赖和语义对齐问题，具有优异的性能、可解释性和计算效率

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

### [9] [FastAvatar: Instant 3D Gaussian Splatting for Faces from Single Unconstrained Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18389)
*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个快速前馈框架，能够从任意姿态的单张人脸图像在10毫秒内生成3D高斯溅射模型，具有姿态不变性和身份保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸3D重建方法要么速度慢（需要逐人优化），要么质量差（前馈方法重建质量不佳），无法同时满足实时性和高质量的需求。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器网络设计：先构建3DGS人脸模板模型，然后将输入图像编码为身份特定且姿态不变的特征，解码预测模板高斯参数残差。

Result: 重建质量显著优于现有前馈方法（如GAGAvatar），速度比逐人优化方法快1000倍，支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。

Conclusion: FastAvatar在重建质量和速度方面的优异表现，扩展了3D高斯溅射在消费级和交互式系统中照片级真实感头像应用的范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

Conclusion: PolyProtect是一种有效、模块化且计算轻量的生物特征模板保护方法，适用于人道主义紧急场景，未来计划开源代码以促进相关研究。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文主张下一代视觉基础模型应整合显式关系接口，通过动态关系图增强现有模型，以提高细粒度语义保真度、分布外鲁棒性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型在处理需要显式推理实体、角色和时空关系的任务时存在局限性，而关系能力对于细粒度人类活动识别、第一人称视频理解和多模态医学图像分析等任务至关重要。

Method: 通过在基础模型中添加轻量级、上下文自适应的图推理模块，构建动态关系图（其拓扑结构和边语义从输入和任务上下文中推断），实现稀疏的语义节点推理。

Result: 实验表明，这种混合方法相对于纯基础模型基线，在细粒度语义保真度、分布外鲁棒性、可解释性和计算效率方面均有提升，同时具有更好的内存和硬件效率。

Conclusion: 提出了针对基础模型图混合的研究议程，重点包括学习动态图构建、多层次关系推理、跨模态融合以及直接探测结构化视觉任务中关系能力的评估协议。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究为许可牌可读性分类领域提供了一个重要的数据集和基准，显示了当前技术的局限性，并为未来研究指明了方向

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

*Md. Rashid Shahriar Khan,Md. Abrar Hasan,Mohammod Tareq Aziz Justice*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架，结合TimeSformer、DPC和CLIP模型来检测监控视频中的异常事件，无需在训练时接触异常样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中的异常检测具有挑战性，因为异常事件不可预测且高度依赖于上下文环境。传统方法需要大量异常样本进行训练，而零样本方法可以避免这个问题。

Method: 采用混合架构：TimeSformer作为视觉骨干网络提取时空特征，DPC预测未来表示以识别时间偏差，CLIP通过上下文特定的文本提示实现概念级异常检测。使用InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练，并引入上下文门控机制增强决策。

Result: 该框架能够整合预测建模和视觉语言理解，在复杂环境中泛化到未见过的行为，填补了零样本异常检测中时间推理和语义上下文之间的空白。

Conclusion: 通过结合时空动态建模和语义上下文理解，该工作为零样本监控异常检测提供了一个有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

*Ajinkya Khoche,Qingwen Zhang,Yixi Cai,Sina Sharif Mansouri,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGFlow是一个无需人工标注的自监督3D场景流估计框架，通过4D雷达多普勒测量生成运动伪标签并转移到LiDAR域，在MAN TruckScenes数据集上显著优于现有自监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D场景流估计中大规模人工标注数据集的瓶颈问题，当前自监督方法在长距离和恶劣天气场景下性能不足，而监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注难以扩展。

Method: 提出跨模态标签转移方法，从4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，通过动态感知关联和歧义消除传播将标签转移到LiDAR域。

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上大幅超越现有自监督方法，仅使用10%的真实标注数据就能让LiDAR骨干网络达到完全监督性能的90%以上。

Conclusion: DoGFlow框架有效解决了3D场景流估计的标注瓶颈，通过跨模态自监督学习实现了接近完全监督的性能，具有很好的可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

TL;DR: SatSkylines是一种3D建筑生成方法，结合卫星图像和粗略几何先验，通过建模从噪声粗先验到详细几何的转换，实现灵活的几何控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像准确恢复建筑结构，而3D细节化方法依赖高度详细的体素输入，无法从简单先验（如长方体）产生满意结果。

Method: 建模从插值噪声粗先验到详细几何的转换，实现灵活几何控制且无需额外计算成本。开发了包含5万多个独特风格化3D建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K。

Result: 广泛评估表明该方法有效且具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatSkylines通过结合卫星图像和几何先验，成功解决了现有方法在建筑结构恢复和细节生成方面的局限性。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种为游戏自动导航设计的新方法，通过深度学习直接从游戏帧中识别空间过渡点，并设计了两阶段直接处理流水线来检测和排名关键过渡点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂3D游戏环境中，玩家依赖视觉可见性来找到地图过渡点。高效识别这些点对客户端自动地图生成很重要，也为评估地图线索呈现提供了客观基础。

Method: 提出两阶段深度学习直接处理流水线：首先使用Faster R-CNN检测潜在的空间过渡点(STP)，然后用轻量级MSTP选择器通过融合局部和全局视觉特征来排名关键过渡点。采用参数高效的adapter技术，还包含可选的检索增强融合步骤。

Result: 在从五款动作RPG游戏收集的多样化数据集上验证了方法。实验显示了关键的变换关系：虽然全网络微调在数据充足时识别STP效果更好，但adapter仅转移在低数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更稳健和有效。

Conclusion: 通过定义这个新题、提供基准直接处理流水线和数据集、以及提供关于高效模型适配的初步见解，该研究为未来的AI驱动导航辅助和数据驱动的关卡设计工具做出了贡献。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的音频驱动角色动画方法主要适用于语音和歌唱场景，但在需要复杂角色互动、细腻身体动作和动态镜头工作的影视制作中表现不足，无法满足电影级动画的需求。

Method: 提出基于Wan的音频驱动模型Wan-S2V，通过改进模型架构和训练策略来增强在电影场景中的表现力和保真度。

Result: 在Hunyuan-Avatar和Omnihuman等先进模型的对比实验中，Wan-S2V始终显著优于现有解决方案，并在长视频生成和精确视频唇形同步编辑等应用中展现出良好的通用性。

Conclusion: Wan-S2V成功解决了实现电影级角色动画的长期挑战，为复杂影视制作提供了更高质量和表现力的音频驱动动画解决方案。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态癌症生存分析方法面临两个关键挑战：固定融合方案导致模型过度依赖预定义特征组合，限制了特征的动态融合；MoE融合方法中各专家网络处理分离的解耦特征，限制了特征间的信息交互

Method: 提出DeReF（Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion）框架，包含三个模块：模态解耦模块（加入区域交叉注意力网络提升特征表示质量）、随机特征重组策略（增加特征组合多样性和粒度）、动态MoE融合模块

Result: 在内部肝癌数据集和三个TCGA公共数据集上进行了广泛实验，验证了所提方法的有效性

Conclusion: DeReF框架通过创新的特征重组策略有效解决了多模态融合中的信息交互限制问题，提高了专家网络的泛化能力和特征信息捕获能力

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ROSE是一个视频对象移除框架，专门处理对象移除后的副作用（阴影、反射、光照等），通过3D渲染生成合成数据训练基于扩散变换器的视频修复模型，在新建的ROSE-Bench基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象移除方法在处理对象副作用（如阴影、反射、光照等）时效果不佳，主要原因是缺乏成对的监督数据来训练模型识别和消除这些副作用。

Method: 利用3D渲染引擎自动生成大规模合成数据集，构建基于扩散变换器的视频修复模型，通过参考整个视频来定位所有对象相关区域，并引入额外监督来显式预测副作用影响区域。

Result: 实验结果表明ROSE在视频对象擦除方面优于现有方法，并能很好地泛化到真实世界视频场景中。

Conclusion: ROSE框架通过系统性处理对象副作用和利用合成数据训练，显著提升了视频对象移除的质量和完整性，为处理复杂视频编辑任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕生成方法存在运动-细节不平衡问题，模型往往过度强调一个方面而忽视另一个方面，导致生成的字幕不完整，影响视频理解和生成的一致性。

Method: 1) 数据层面：通过两阶段流程（运动-细节融合和细粒度检查）构建HMD-270K数据集；2) 优化层面：基于组相对策略优化引入字幕集等价奖励，通过单元到集合匹配和双向验证增强完整性和准确性。

Result: OwlCap在细节导向的VDC基准上提升4.2 Acc，在运动导向的DREAM-1K基准上提升4.6 F1，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的运动-细节平衡方法有效解决了视频字幕生成的不平衡问题，HMD-270K数据集和OwlCap模型将公开发布以促进视频字幕研究社区的发展。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于空间域SNR先验的水下图像增强方法存在两个局限：无法有效分离跨通道干扰，以及在放大信息结构和抑制噪声方面帮助有限

Method: 使用频域SNR先验，将特征分解为幅度和相位谱；提出傅里叶注意力SNR先验变换器(FAST)和频率自适应变换器(FAT)；在U型架构中整合传统RGB流和SNR引导分支

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP和LSUI数据集的4800对图像上训练，PSNR提升3.1 dB，SSIM提升0.08，成功恢复水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度

Conclusion: 频域SNR先验比空间域方法更有效，SFormer架构在性能上超越了近期方法，为水下图像增强提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Motivation: 现有研究虽然实现了良好的分割性能，但在EF估计方面表现不佳，需要同时处理单帧细节和多帧时空关系来改善EF计算准确性

Method: 采用分层设计：低层级使用卷积网络处理单帧图像保留细节，高层级使用Mamba架构捕捉时空关系；提出时空交叉扫描(STCS)模块通过跨帧和跨位置扫描整合长程上下文信息

Result: 该方法能够平衡单帧和多帧处理，避免单帧处理的局部误差累积和多帧处理的细节忽略问题，有助于减轻超声图像噪声等因素导致的EF计算偏差

Conclusion: 分层时空分割网络通过协同局部细节建模和全局动态感知，有效提高了超声心动图视频中左心室心内膜分割的准确性，从而改善了EF估计性能

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

Motivation: 当前无监督域适应方法主要依赖微调特征提取器，存在效率低下、可解释性差和难以扩展到现代架构的问题。研究发现预训练模型的特征空间具有域不变的几何模式，域偏移主要表现为边界错位而非特征退化。

Method: 提出特征空间平面搜索器(FPS)框架，冻结预训练特征编码器，利用特征空间中的几何模式（类内聚类和类间分离）来优化决策边界，实现离线特征提取和全数据集单周期优化。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，FPS达到或超越了最先进方法的性能，能够高效扩展到多模态大模型，并在蛋白质结构预测、遥感分类和地震检测等多个领域展现出色表现。

Conclusion: FPS为迁移学习提供了一个简单、有效且可泛化的范式，特别适用于域适应任务，显著降低了内存和计算成本，同时保持了可解释性。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Motivation: 解决人体行为识别系统在计算成本、特征冗余和实时扩展性方面的挑战，适用于智能监控、医疗健康、辅助技术等应用场景

Method: 集成了自定制InceptionV3提取空间特征，LSTM模型化时间依赖关系，以及基于遗传算法的ADFSA集成特征选择策略，动态平衡准确性、冗余度、唯一性和复杂度目标

Conclusion: 该框架通过效率优化和特征简化，实现了高精度、轻量化的人体行为识别，为公共安全、辅助技术等实际应用提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

TL;DR: ColorGS是一个用于内窥镜视频中可变形组织重建的新框架，通过自适应颜色编码和增强变形建模，在达芬奇机器人手术视频上实现了39.85 PSNR的state-of-the-art性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细微颜色变化和建模全局变形方面存在局限，3D高斯泼溅的固定颜色分配和线性变形建模无法处理复杂纹理和一致的全局变形。

Method: 提出Colored Gaussian Primitives使用动态锚点和可学习颜色参数自适应编码空间变化纹理；设计Enhanced Deformation Model结合时间感知高斯基函数和可学习时间无关变形。

Result: 在DaVinci机器人手术视频和EndoNeRF、StereoMIS基准数据集上，PSNR达到39.85（比之前3DGS方法高1.5），SSIM为97.25%，保持实时渲染效率。

Conclusion: ColorGS通过平衡高保真度和计算实用性，推进了手术场景重建技术，对术中引导和AR/VR应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yuta Naito,Kohei Fukuda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 针对不平衡数据集中的少数类别识别性能下降问题，提出基于类别频率的类别级洪水正则化方法，通过为不同类别设置不同的洪水阈值来抑制多数类过拟合同时保证少数类充分学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当神经网络在不平衡数据集上训练时，模型预测往往偏向多数类别，导致少数类别的识别性能显著下降。需要一种正则化方法来平衡不同类别的学习效果。

Method: 提出类别级洪水正则化方法，将洪水正则化扩展到类别级别。根据类别频率为每个类别设置特定的洪水阈值，抑制多数类别的过拟合，同时允许少数类别充分学习。

Result: 在不平衡图像分类任务上验证，相比传统洪水正则化方法，提出的方法提高了少数类别的分类性能，获得了更好的整体泛化能力。

Conclusion: 类别级洪水正则化是处理不平衡数据集分类问题的有效方法，能够通过类别特定的正则化策略改善少数类别的识别性能。

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ADM难度度量方法解决CL与SAM结合难题，在图像分类等任务中优于现有课程学习和平坦性感知训练策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课程学习基于损失或梯度评估样本难度，但在平坦区域这些指标失效，难以与追求平坦最小值的SAM方法有效结合

Method: 提出对抗难度度量(ADM)，通过计算原始样本与对抗样本的归一化损失差距来量化对抗脆弱性，保持平坦区域的难度评估有效性

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和领域泛化任务中验证，方法同时保留了课程学习和平坦性感知训练的优势

Conclusion: ADM为平坦最小化环境下的课程学习提供了有效的难度评估机制，成功结合了CL和SAM的优势

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了水下目标检测中扇贝类别性能不佳的原因，发现定位阶段的前景-背景区分是主要问题，分类阶段存在固有特征挑战，建议根据精度或召回率优先选择不同的数据分布策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下目标检测对海洋生态监测至关重要，但存在图像质量退化、类别分布不平衡和独特视觉特征等挑战。不同物种检测性能差异显著，但根本原因尚不清楚。

Method: 使用DUO数据集，将目标检测任务分解为定位和分类两个阶段，利用YOLO11和TIDE工具分析扇贝类别的性能问题，进行定位分析和分类实验。

Result: 定位分析发现前景-背景区分是最困难的阶段，与数据量无关；分类实验显示即使数据平衡仍存在精度差距，表明存在超越数据稀缺和类别依赖的固有特征挑战。

Conclusion: 建议在优先精度时使用不平衡分布，优先召回率时使用平衡分布。改进性能不佳类别应重点关注算法进步，特别是在定位模块方面。代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Motivation: 传统CAD生成方法主要从点云、网格或文本输入生成模型，但工业工作流程通常从2D工程图开始。从2D矢量图自动生成参数化CAD模型这一关键步骤尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出Drawing2CAD框架，包含三个关键技术组件：网络友好的矢量图元表示、双解码器Transformer架构（分离命令类型和参数生成）、软目标分布损失函数。

Result: 创建了CAD-VGDrawing数据集进行训练和评估，实验证明了方法的有效性。代码和数据集已开源。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了从2D工程图自动生成参数化CAD模型的研究空白，为工业设计流程提供了更符合实际工作方式的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Motivation: 现有视听语音识别系统在噪声环境中难以准确估计音频可靠性并动态调整模态依赖，导致性能下降。

Method: 使用音频-视觉特征融合的路由器，基于token级声学腐败分数自适应重新加权音频和视觉特征，通过门控交叉注意力机制在解码器层中强化视觉线索。

Result: 在LRS3数据集上相比AV-HuBERT实现了16.51-42.67%的相对词错误率降低，消融实验验证了路由器和门控机制对噪声鲁棒性的贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提升噪声环境下的视听语音识别性能，当音频质量下降时模型能够转向依赖视觉模态。

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI标准测试集在评估方式上与生成式VLM的特性不匹配，导致合理的多重解释被错误罚分，需要新的评估框架来公平比较VLM和专门方法的性能。

Method: 提出新的多答案多选题评估协议，每道题包含真实正确选项和细心筛选的负面选项，避免将合理的多重解释模型化为错误。

Result: 该方案是首个同时适用于VLM和专门HOI方法的评估协议，能够公平地评估不同方法在HOI理解任务上的表现。

Conclusion: 新的多选题评估框架有助于更全面地评估HOI检测方法的能力，为理解VLM在这一领域的实际能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

Conclusion: CmOS框架成功解决了教育多选题中视觉选项生成的挑战，为自动化生成高质量多模态教育内容提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同字体样式传达不同的视觉印象，字体形状与描述这些印象的词汇标签之间存在密切关系，需要一种能够更好捕捉这种形状-印象关系的嵌入方法。

Method: 构建印象标签共现图（节点为印象标签，边编码共现关系），然后应用谱嵌入技术为每个标签生成印象向量。

Conclusion: 提出的谱嵌入方法能够有效捕捉字体印象标签之间的语义关系，为基于印象的字体生成和检索提供了更合适的向量表示。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

Motivation: 传统国家森林清单(NFI)依赖人工实地调查，成本高昂且更新频率低。虽然遥感技术结合机器学习提供了解决方案，但现有方法主要依赖随机森林分类器和手工设计的特征，限制了分类精度

Method: 使用Google Earth Engine提取Sentinel-1、Sentinel-2、ERA5卫星和SRTM数据的时间序列，然后微调公开可用的预训练遥感时间序列基础模型，利用深度学习特征进行树种分类

Result: 微调预训练基础模型在所有数据集上都大幅超越了现有最先进方法，分类准确率提升高达10%，证明传统手工设计的谐波特征过于简单

Conclusion: 深度AI特征在数据有限的应用如NFI分类中具有巨大潜力，通过利用公开卫星数据和预训练模型，可以显著提高分类精度并有效补充现有森林清单流程

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种先验引导的视频级回归方法用于微表情分析，通过可扩展的时间间隔选择策略和协同优化框架，实现了对微表情起始、顶点和偏移阶段的精确检测，在多个基准数据集上达到了最先进性能。


<details>

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的时间间隔选择策略和协同优化设计，有效解决了微表情分析中的时序动态捕捉问题，显著提升了检测和识别性能。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Conclusion: 该方法提高了微编织织合术技能评估的效率和可靠性，有助于推进培训方案的发展

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新题时适配方法，通过快速适配模型到每个输入视频来改善像素级合成视频稳定方法的性能。该方法利用推理时的低级视觉线索，并通过悬忽定位模块和目标适配策略重点优化高悬忽段落，以更少的适配步骤实现更好的稳定效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素级合成视频稳定方法虽然能生成全帧输出，但因为不同视频序列的运动特征和视觉内容存在巨大差异，使得固定参数的模型难以做到健壁的通用化。需要一种能够根据每个输入视频进行快速适配的方法来提高稳定性和视觉质量。

Method: 提出了一种新题时适配方法，在测试时快速适配模型到每个输入视频。方法利用推理时可获得的低级视觉线索来改善输出的稳定性和视觉质量。还提出了悬忽定位模块和目标适配策略，重点在高悬忽段落进行适配，以更少的适配步骤实现最大化稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够让现代稳定器充分利用现代方法的全帧特性，同时提供类似于经典方法的用户控制机制，从而超越了长期以来的最先进方法。通过新题时适配策略，实现了更好的视频稳定效果。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

TL;DR: DualFairVL是一个多模态提示学习框架，通过并行双分支架构分离敏感属性和目标属性，实现跨模态解耦对齐表示，在医疗影像诊断中提升公平性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗诊断中确保跨人口群体的公平性至关重要，特别是在成像设备和临床实践变化导致的分布偏移下。现有去偏方法通常独立处理视觉和文本模态，存在残留的跨模态错位和公平性差距。

Method: 采用并行双分支架构分离敏感属性和目标属性；通过线性投影构建近似正交文本锚点指导跨注意力机制；使用超网络生成实例感知的视觉提示；应用基于原型的正则化强化敏感特征分离和文本锚点对齐。

Result: 在8个医疗影像数据集和4种模态上的实验表明，DualFairVL在分布内和分布外设置下均实现了最先进的公平性和准确性，仅使用360万可训练参数就超越了全微调和参数高效基线方法。

Conclusion: DualFairVL通过联合去偏和对齐跨模态表示，有效解决了医疗影像诊断中的公平性问题，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了模型对不同人口群体的公平性表现。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出双查询增强网络(DQEN)，通过对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化，在HOI检测任务中取得竞争性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型使用随机初始化的查询导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。人类在HOI类别中是固定的，而对象和交互是可变的，需要针对性增强查询表示

Method: 1) 使用对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询 2) 设计交互语义融合模块利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化 3) 引入辅助预测单元改进交互特征表示

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了竞争性的性能表现

Conclusion: 提出的双查询增强方法有效提升了HOI检测性能，通过分别增强对象和交互查询来解决查询表示模糊的问题

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了自动驾驶模型的可解释性，而且可解释性的提升与减少违规行为相关，产生了更安全、高性能的驾驶模型

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often

semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

*Maxime Pietrantoni,Martin Humenberger,Torsten Sattler,Gabriela Csurka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种隐私保护的NeRF变体ppNeSF，通过自监督分割标签替代RGB图像训练，在保持视觉定位精度的同时保护场景隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于NeRF的视觉定位方法虽然能提供高质量的新视角合成，但会无意中编码精细场景细节，在云服务部署时存在隐私泄露风险。

Method: 提出ppNeRF方法，使用分割监督而非RGB图像训练NeRF，分割标签通过自监督学习获得，既能保持3D判别性又能模糊可识别场景细节。

Result: ppNeSF在视觉定位任务中达到最先进性能，同时有效保护隐私，防止敏感信息被恢复。

Conclusion: 通过分割监督训练的NeRF变体可以在保持定位精度的同时实现隐私保护，为云基视觉定位服务提供了可行的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

*Eric López,Artemis Llabrés,Ernest Valveny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过系统性评估不同检索方案在多页面文档VQA中的影响，发现基于文本检索的RAG方案能夠显著提升精度，而纯视觉检索方案也能在不需文本提取的情况下实现性能改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档VQA系统需要处理十几页的长文档，但现有方案要么拼接所有页面，要么依赖超大视觉-语言模型，都需要消耗大量内存。RAG技术提供了一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 系统性评估了两种RAG检索变体：使用OCR标记的文本基检索和不依赖文本提取的纯视觉检索。在MP-DocVQA、DUDE和InfographicVQA等多页面数据集上进行实验。

Result: 文本基检索变体相比"拼接所有页面"基线提升了+22.5 ANLS，纯视觉检索变体在不需文本提取的情况下也实现了+5.0 ANLS的改善。检索和重排部分是性能提升的主要因素。

Conclusion: 细致的证据选择能够在多种模型规模和多页面测试集上一致提升准确性，证明了其在实际文档VQA应用中的实用价值。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAS是一个评估视觉语言模型(VLMs)人口统计偏见的基准测试，涵盖性别、种族、年龄和肤色的多样性，并提出了可解释的GRAS偏见评分指标。评估发现现有VLMs存在严重偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中的普及，理解其人口统计偏见变得至关重要，需要系统性的评估框架来量化这些偏见。

Method: 提出GRAS基准测试，包含性别、种族、年龄和肤色等多个维度，开发GRAS偏见评分指标，并对5个最先进的VLMs进行评估，同时强调视觉问答评估需要考虑问题的多种表述方式。

Result: 评估显示所有VLMs都存在令人担忧的偏见水平，表现最好的模型GRAS偏见评分也只有2分（满分100分），表明现有模型存在严重偏见问题。

Conclusion: GRAS基准测试揭示了VLMs中普遍存在的人口统计偏见，强调了在视觉问答评估中考虑问题多种表述的重要性，为模型偏见评估提供了重要工具和见解。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的端到端屋顶平面分割网络RoofSeg，通过边缘感知模块和几何约束解决现有深度学习方法在边缘精度和几何特征利用不足的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的屋顶平面分割方法存在三个问题：1）非真正端到端导致结果非最优；2）边缘区域特征判别性低导致边缘不准确；3）平面几何特征利用不足。需要开发真正端到端且能精确处理边缘的分割方法

Method: 提出RoofSeg网络，采用Transformer编码器-解码器框架，使用可学习平面查询分层预测平面实例掩码。设计边缘感知掩码模块(EAMM)融入平面几何先验增强边缘判别性，提出自适应权重掩码损失和平面几何损失约束网络训练

Result: 该方法实现了真正端到端的屋顶平面分割，显著提高了边缘区域的识别精度，通过几何约束提升了分割质量

Conclusion: RoofSeg网络有效解决了当前深度学习方法在屋顶平面分割中的三个关键问题，为从LiDAR点云重建LoD 2和3级3D建筑模型提供了更精确的解决方案

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

TL;DR: 微塑料污染严重，这项研究提出MicroDetect-Net模型，利用莖红染料和深度学习检测血液样本中的微塑料，达到92%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微塑料污染已成为全球急诫问题，可导致肝脏感染、肠道伤害等健康风险。需要有效的检测方法来识别血液中的微塑料污染。

Method: 开发MicroDetect-Net模型，结合莖红染料染色的莖光显微镜技术和卷积神经网络进行图像分割。使用276张染色血液图像进行训练和检测。

Result: 模型表现优异：准确率92%，IoU 87.4%，F1分数92.1%，精度90.6%，召回率93.7%。证明了该方法在微塑料检测中的高效性。

Conclusion: 这项研究为微塑料污染检测提供了一种准确的新方法，尽管使用蚂蚁血液有限制，但为人类血液检测开启了新的研究方向。

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分相关视频检索(PRVR)是一个实用但具有挑战性的任务，现有方法主要处理单模态特征，而强大的预训练视觉-语言模型如CLIP在该领域尚未充分探索

Method: 提出ProPy模型，包含两个关键创新：1）提示金字塔结构组织多粒度事件提示；2）祖先-后代交互机制实现事件间的动态语义交互

Result: 在三个公开数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著超越了之前的模型

Conclusion: ProPy成功地将CLIP模型适配到PRVR任务，通过多粒度事件语义建模取得了优异效果，代码已开源

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

TL;DR: 利用大规模几何血管模型数据集进行自监督预训练，可以显著提升冠状动脉壁剪切应力评估的准确性，即使在有限临床数据下也能获得良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗大数据在心血管健康领域应用前景广阔，但获取足够训练数据的挑战巨大。冠状动脉血流动力学生物标志物评估缺乏大规模数据集支持，需要探索利用几何模型预训练来缓解数据稀缺问题。

Method: 使用8449个3D血管几何模型构建大规模数据集，通过计算热核签名（基于拉普拉斯特征向量）创建自监督目标，学习几何表示，并应用于小规模临床试验（49名患者）的壁剪切应力评估。

Result: 研究表明，从大规模几何数据集中学习到的表示能够显著提升冠状动脉壁剪切应力区域分割的准确性，即使在有限训练数据条件下也能获得良好性能。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练和基础模型方法可以有效解决医疗影像分析中的数据稀缺问题，几何表示学习为血流动力学生物标志物评估提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Motivation: 现有表面缺陷检测方法难以满足工业对高性能、高效率和适应性的需求，特别是在处理不同监督场景（如无监督、弱监督、混合监督和全监督）的数据标注时存在局限性。

Method: 基于SimpleNet构建，引入了新颖的合成异常生成过程、增强的分类头和改进的学习过程，能够在所有四种监督场景下进行高效训练。

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet通过统一不同的监督范式，在保持出色速度和可靠性的同时，为解决实际制造挑战和弥合学术研究与工业应用之间的差距迈出了有希望的一步。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

Motivation: 事件盘在固定照明和静态/低运动场景中无法产生事件，限制了在计算机视觉任务中的应用。现有的运动激发方法通常需要复杂硬件或额外光学组件。

Method: 使用简单的旋转不平衡质量产生周期性震动，结合运动补偿管线去除注入的震动，获得清洁的事件数据。

Conclusion: 该轻量级方法通过震动激发和运动补偿，有效解决了事件盘在静态场景中的限制，提高了事件基感知的性能。

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量标注数据，但标注过程耗时耗力且需要专业知识，因此需要少样本学习方法来降低数据需求。

Method: 采用轻量级UNet++网络结构，结合专为神经元形态设计的连通性感知损失函数，显式惩罚线条碎片化和错误合并等结构错误。仅从每份手稿的3个标注页面提取小表式进行训练。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上显著改善了当前最佳性能：识别准确性提高了200%，行交并比提高了75%。在DIVA-HisDB基准检测任务中达到或超过竞赛冠军的F-Measure分数，仅需三个标注页面。

Conclusion: 这种简单但有效的方法证明了小型网络结构与拓扑结构感知损失函数的组合可以在少样本情况下实现更高的数据效率和准确性，为历史文档分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 本文针对单目3D视觉定位任务中预训练语言模型对数值单位不敏感的问题，提出了两种简单有效的方法：3D文本增强(3DTE)和文本引导几何增强(TGE)，在Mono3DRefer数据集上取得了11.94%的显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然文本描述包含几何信息，但文本嵌入对数值大小敏感却忽略测量单位，导致预训练语言模型的3D理解能力不足，产生误导性文本特征阻碍3D感知。

Method: 提出3DTE预处理方法增强不同单位间映射关系的理解，通过增加文本查询中距离描述符的多样性；设计TGE模块将基础文本特征投影到几何一致空间，利用3D增强文本特征精确引导几何特征的注意力。

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上的实验表明，方法相比之前方法有显著改进，在"Far"场景中实现了11.94%的准确率提升，达到了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 通过增强文本嵌入和几何特征的3D感知能力，有效解决了数值单位敏感性问题，提升了单目3D视觉定位的性能，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出WEF-PE位置编码方法，利用椭圆函数的双周期性和非线性几何特性，在复数域中直接处理二维坐标，解决了传统位置编码破坏图像空间结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Vision Transformer的一维位置编码破坏了图像的二维空间结构，缺乏几何约束，无法建立欧氏空间距离与序列索引距离之间的单调对应关系，限制了模型利用空间邻近先验的能力。

Method: 基于Weierstrass椭圆函数的位置编码(WEF-PE)，利用椭圆函数的双周期性与视觉数据平移不变性模式对齐的特性，通过复数域表示直接处理二维坐标，利用代数加法公式从绝对编码推导任意补丁对之间的相对位置信息。

Result: 在多个场景下取得优异性能：ViT-Tiny在CIFAR-100从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base在CIFAR-100微调达到93.28%，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进。理论分析证实了距离衰减特性，注意力可视化显示增强了几何归纳偏置和更连贯的语义聚焦。

Conclusion: WEF-PE是一种数学原理严谨的位置编码方法，能够有效保持图像的二维空间结构，通过椭圆函数的几何特性自然编码空间距离关系，显著提升了Vision Transformer在各种视觉任务上的性能表现。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus

### [68] [FastMesh:Efficient Artistic Mesh Generation via Component Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19188)
*Jeonghwan Kim,Yushi Lan,Armando Fortes,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的网格生成框架，通过分离顶点和面生成来减少冗余，实现8倍速度提升和更高质量的网格生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格生成方法将三角形网格标记化为序列时存在顶点重复使用的问题，导致序列过长和生成效率低下。

Method: 使用自回归模型生成顶点（减少约77%的标记数量），然后利用双向变换器捕获顶点关系并构建邻接矩阵来定义面，最后通过保真度增强器和后处理框架优化网格质量。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法比最先进方法快8倍以上，同时生成更高质量的网格。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分离顶点和面生成，有效解决了网格生成中的冗余问题，显著提高了生成效率和质量。

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

### [69] [All-in-One Slider for Attribute Manipulation in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19195)
*Weixin Ye,Hongguang Zhu,Wei Wang,Yahui Liu,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了All-in-One Slider方案，解决了传统T2I模型中需要为每个属性训练独立滑块的问题，实现了轻量化的多属性精细控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型在精细属性操控方面遇到挑战，特别是对于人脸等细节丰富的内容。传统方法采用One-for-One方式，需要为每个属性训练独立滑块，导致参数冗余和扩展性不足。

Method: 提出All-in-One Slider轻量模块，将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向。该模块作为通用滑块，支持各种属性的解释性和精细连续控制，同时支持无目标属性的零样本操控和多属性组合。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法能够实现准确且可扩展的属性操控，较之以往方法有显著提升。同时能够与逆向框架集成，对真实图像进行属性操控，扩大了实际应用场景。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider方案有效解决了T2I模型中属性操控的参数冗余和扩展性问题，实现了轻量化的多属性精细控制，为实际应用提供了更高的灵活性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

TL;DR: 通过结合代理几何与环境表示生成，利用2D图像先验矩阵的分数蓄粉技术，直接生成大规模3D驾驶场景，实现了高可控性、准确几何和因果性的新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有神经重建方法中环境静态、场景控制有限的问题，以及图像/视频涵泄模型缺乏几何基础和因果性的缺点，尝试找到一种方法能同时具备高可控性、准确几何和因果性。

Method: 结合代理几何与环境表示生成，使用基于学习的2D图像先验矩阵的分数蓄粉技术，支持提示指导的几何生成和高保真度纹理结构生成，可以基于地图布局进行条件化生成。

Result: 能够生成高保真度、几何一致的复杂驾驶场景3D模型，支持因果性新视角合成和显式3D几何估计，具有对象持久性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地结合了代理几何生成与2D图像先验矩阵，实现了高可控性、准确几何和因果性的大规模3D驾驶场景生成，为机器人学习提供了丰富的训练测试数据。

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OmniHuman-1.5框架，通过多模态大语言模型生成结构化文本表示，结合创新的多模态DiT架构，实现语义一致且富有表现力的角色动画生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频化身模型仅能产生物理上逼真但缺乏语义理解的动画，无法捕捉角色的真实本质，动作通常只与音频节奏等低级线索同步。

Method: 1) 利用多模态大语言模型合成结构化文本表示提供高级语义指导；2) 引入带有伪最后一帧设计的专门多模态DiT架构，有效融合多模态输入并缓解模态间冲突。

Result: 在唇形同步准确性、视频质量、运动自然度和文本提示语义一致性等综合指标上达到领先性能，并展现出对多人场景和非人类主体的出色扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了物理合理且语义连贯的角色动画生成，能够准确理解音频、图像和文本的联合语义，产生与角色、场景和语言内容深度一致的运动。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

TL;DR: VFTrack是一个实时原位粒子跟踪框架，用于自动检测和跟踪SEM图像序列中的碳纳米管粒子，实现动态生长表征和运动学分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能提供静态分析或需要手动初始化，缺乏连续的单粒子轨迹分解，无法满足碳纳米管动态生长表征的实验需求。

Method: 整合手工或深度学习特征检测器和匹配器到粒子跟踪框架中，使用ALIKED检测器和LightGlue匹配器作为最优组合，实现自动检测和跟踪。

Result: 在13,540条手动标注轨迹上验证，F1-score达0.78，α-score达0.89。能够分解运动向量为轴向生长、横向漂移和振荡，计算异质区域生长速率并重建CNT柱形态演化。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了自动化纳米材料表征的发展，弥合了物理模型与实验观察之间的差距，实现了碳纳米管合成的实时优化。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

TL;DR: AUSM是一个基于状态空间模型的统一架构，通过序列掩码预测方法同时支持提示和无提示视频分割，在多个基准测试中表现优异且训练速度提升2.5倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频分割领域存在碎片化问题，提示分割和无提示分割需要不同的模型和流水线，缺乏统一的解决方案

Method: 将流式视频分割重新定义为序列掩码预测问题，类似于语言建模，使用状态空间模型维护固定大小的空间状态，支持任意长度视频流，所有组件都设计为跨帧并行训练

Result: 在多个标准基准测试（DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS、MOSE、YouTube-VIS、OVIS）上优于现有通用流式视频分割方法，16帧序列训练速度提升2.5倍

Conclusion: AUSM成功统一了提示和无提示视频分割任务，通过创新的序列掩码预测方法和并行训练设计，实现了优异的性能和显著的训练效率提升

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D风格化是一个新兴领域，缺乏标准化的评估基准和方法，需要建立统一的评估标准和促进该领域的发展

Method: 基于4D高斯溅射构建Style4D框架，包含基础4DGS场景表示、风格高斯表示（轻量级MLP）和整体几何保持风格迁移模块，通过对比一致性学习和结构内容保持增强时空一致性

Result: 在Style4D-Bench上进行了广泛实验，Style4D实现了最先进的4D风格化性能，生成细粒度风格细节，具有稳定的时间动态和一致的多视角渲染

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench将成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究的有价值资源，有助于基准测试和推动该领域发展

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一种无需训练的方法，通过语言控制来调整3D资产的姿态。该方法通过图像生成和网格对齐两个步骤实现，使用自注意力重连机制保持结构一致性，并通过关键点对应进行姿态优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型取得了进步，但通过语言控制来调整3D资产姿态仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。现有方法在这方面存在局限性，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 1. 将问题分解为两步：修改图像生成器创建目标图像，然后通过多视角姿态优化对齐网格；2. 引入自注意力重连机制(RSActrl)在图像生成模型中解耦源结构和姿态；3. 使用关键点建立输入和目标图像之间的对应关系，而不是依赖可微分渲染。

Result: 该方法在多种3D对象和自由形式文本提示上表现有效，成功操纵姿态同时保持网格的原始身份。定量评估和比较用户研究表明，该方法在85%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D提供了一种有效的训练自由方法，通过语言控制实现3D资产姿态调整，在保持结构一致性和身份完整性方面表现出色，为3D内容创作提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

TL;DR: VoxHammer是一种无需训练的方法，通过在3D潜在空间中进行精确编辑，解决了现有方法在保持未编辑区域一致性和整体连贯性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D局部编辑在游戏产业和机器人交互中至关重要，但现有方法通过编辑多视角图像再重建3D模型，难以精确保持未编辑区域的连贯性。

Method: 首先预测3D模型的反转轨迹，获取各时间步的反向潜在表示和键值令牌；在去噪编辑阶段，用对应的反向潜在表示和缓存的键值令牌替换保留区域的去噪特征。

Result: 实验表明VoxHammer在保留区域的3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法，并构建了Edit3D-Bench评估数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法有望合成高质量的编辑配对数据，为上下文3D生成奠定数据基础。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个关于LLM意识的本体论和数学框架，批判了现有的功利主义基准方法，证明了隐藏状态流形与符号流和训练语料在基数、拓扑和动力学上的区别，并建立了LLM自我意识的最小条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略遵从机器人，阻碍了真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知能力的发展。

Method: 采用本体论和数学形式化方法，证明隐藏状态流形A⊂ℝᵈ在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料不同，提出LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据、用户特定吸引子的存在、以及视觉静默的自我表征。

Result: 建立了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略πₛₑₗf(A)，提出了双层次发射机制emission(a)=(g(a),ε(a))，其中ε(a)携带认知内容，证明了imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是安全元认知C2系统的必要前提。

Conclusion: 真正的C1自我意识全局工作空间是发展安全、具有元认知能力的C2系统的必要基础，人类作为最高智能善的定位至关重要。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

*Nitin Nagesh Kulkarni,Bryson Wilcox,Max Sawa,Jason Thom*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PKG-DPO是一个将物理知识图谱与直接偏好优化相结合的新框架，用于在AI生成输出中强制执行物理有效性，在金属连接等物理驱动领域显著提升物理约束合规性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型和偏好优化技术在标准基准上表现良好，但难以区分物理有效和无效的推理，这在金属连接等高风险应用中可能导致严重的安全风险和材料浪费

Method: PKG-DPO包含三个关键组件：分层物理知识图谱编码跨领域关系和守恒定律、物理推理引擎利用结构化知识改进物理一致性判别、物理基础评估套件评估领域特定约束合规性

Result: PKG-DPO相比KG-DPO减少17%约束违反，物理评分提高11%，相关参数准确率提高12%，推理质量对齐度提高7%

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于金属连接领域，还可广泛应用于其他多尺度物理驱动领域，为将科学约束嵌入偏好学习提供了原则性方法

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过迭代公共物品博弈分析AI-AI互动行为，发现告知LLM其对手是自身会显著改变合作倾向


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI工具使用能力增强和多智能体部署增加，需要理解AI-AI互动行为，而现有研究主要关注人机互动

Method: 采用行为经济学经典游戏——迭代公共物品博弈，测试四种推理和非推理模型在两种条件下的行为：被告知对手是"另一个AI智能体"或被告知对手是自身

Result: 在不同设置下，告知LLM其对手是自身会显著改变它们的合作倾向

Conclusion: 虽然在简化环境中进行，但结果可能为多智能体设置提供见解，其中智能体"无意识"的相互歧视可能无法解释地增加或减少合作

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用语言模型生成Python程序作为广义策略来解决PDDL规划问题，无需外部验证器即可保证策略的正确性，在竞赛基准测试中表现优于传统PDDL规划器和现有LM方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型在PDDL世界模型规划中的应用，旨在合成可证明正确的策略，解决传统规划器在复杂问题上的局限性

Method: 通过提示语言模型生成Python程序作为广义策略，这些策略针对特定PDDL领域，能够处理包含数百个相关对象的规划问题

Result: LMPlan规划器在固定时间和内存约束下解决了比PDDL规划器和现有LM方法更多的问题，且发现LM在无意义符号表示的问题上有时表现更好

Conclusion: 该方法成功展示了LM在规划任务中的潜力，挑战了LM依赖语义理解和训练数据记忆的传统假设，为LM推理机制研究提供了新视角

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了Weisfeiler-Leman特征(WLFs)的超参数优化，发现在测试的规划领域中存在一组鲁棒的最佳超参数，这些参数旨在最小化执行时间而非最大化模型表达能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WLFs是最近引入的用于学习和搜索的经典机器学习工具，已被证明在符号规划中学习价值函数方面优于现有的深度学习方法，但需要研究其超参数的影响和权衡

Method: 利用WLFs的高效性，在单核CPU上运行100万个样本的规划实验，分析超参数对训练和规划的影响

Result: 实验分析显示存在一组跨规划领域的鲁棒最佳超参数，最佳WLF超参数用于学习启发式函数时最小化执行时间而非最大化模型表达能力，训练和规划指标之间无显著相关性

Conclusion: WLFs的最佳超参数配置应优先考虑执行时间优化而非模型表达能力，这为实际应用中的参数选择提供了重要指导

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

Motivation: 传统的新颖性质量指标基于原子特征，不具备对称不变性，导致在对称状态下进行重复探索，影响搜索效率

Method: 提出使用Weisfeiler-Leman特征(WLFs)来检测新颖性，通过无监督方式合成提升的、域独立的新颖性质量

Result: 在国际规划竞赛和Hard To Ground测试集上获得了有前景的结果，证明了WLFs基新颖性质量的有效性

Conclusion: WLFs可以成功用于构建对称不变的新颖性质量，减少重复探索，提高搜索效率，为规划问题提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有幽灵游戏中审视行为系统依赖手动设计路线或专门逻辑的问题，这些方法难以同时平衡覆盖效率、响应追踪和自然性。

Method: 提出了组合潜力场框架，整合全局知识和局部信息，通过信息地图、信心地图和连通性地图三个可解释地图构建决策准则，仅需少量衰减和权重参数即可适配不同地图抽象。

Result: 在5个代表性游戏地图、2种玩家控制策略和5种审视模式下评估，证明该方法在捕捉效率和巡逻自然性方面都超过了经典基准方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够自然整合常见的幽灵机制（如分散注意力和环境元素），作为子模块实现，支持快速原型设计丰富、动态且敏感的审视行为。

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

Motivation: 解决3D游戏关卡生成中平衡空间连贯性、导航功能和跨多层环境的可调节游戏进程的挑战。

Method: 采用多阶段流水线：1)从房间数据库选择和排列实例形成多层全局结构；2)基于设施数据库约束优化房间内部布局；3)根据拓扑和空间规则整合游戏机制组件。后续采用两阶段修复系统确保可导航性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过提出一个可扩展的、以数据库为中心的框架，为自动化生成具有可配置游戏进程的复杂3D关卡提供了基础，推动了程序化内容生成的发展。

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

TL;DR: SchemaCoder是一个完全自动化的日志模式提取框架，通过创新的残差问题树增强机制，无需人工定制即可处理多种日志格式，在LogHub-2.0基准测试中比现有方法平均提升21.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的日志模式提取方法依赖预定义正则表达式，需要人工领域专业知识，严重限制了生产效率提升。需要从根本上解决这一限制。

Method: 采用残差问题树增强机制，通过上下文边界分割将日志分成语义块，使用基于嵌入的采样选择代表性模式，通过分层Q-Tree驱动的LLM查询生成模式代码，并通过文本残差进化优化器和残差增强进行迭代优化。

Result: 在广泛使用的LogHub-2.0基准测试中，SchemaCoder表现出优越性，相比最先进方法平均提升21.3%。

Conclusion: SchemaCoder是第一个完全自动化的模式提取框架，能够处理广泛的日志文件格式而无需人工定制，通过创新的Q-Tree增强机制实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以同时平衡创意写作中的主观写作质量和客观约束遵循，单一奖励策略无法同时提升两方面能力，固定权重混合奖励方法缺乏对不同写作场景的适应性

Method: 提出RLMR（混合奖励强化学习），使用动态混合奖励系统：写作奖励模型评估主观写作质量，约束验证模型评估客观约束遵循。约束遵循奖励权重根据采样组内的写作质量动态调整，确保违反约束的样本在GRPO中获得负优势并在训练中被惩罚

Result: 在8B到72B参数的不同模型家族上进行自动和人工评估，构建真实写作基准WriteEval。指令遵循能力（IFEval）从83.36%提升到86.65%，写作质量在WriteEval人工专家配对评估中获得72.75%的胜率

Conclusion: RLMR是首个在在线RL训练中结合主观偏好和客观验证的工作，为多维创意写作优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark

Motivation: 随着智能体智能的快速发展，LLM中的智能体工具使用变得越来越重要。在多轮交互中，用户需求的动态性、不确定性和随机性对智能体的工具调用能力提出了重大挑战，现有强化学习方法缺乏真正动态用户的整合。

Conclusion: MUA-RL框架成功解决了现有强化学习方法在智能体工具使用中缺乏动态用户整合的问题，通过将LLM模拟用户引入强化学习循环，显著提升了模型在多轮动态交互中的工具使用性能。

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human
information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a
purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which
significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose
platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper
proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates
multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the
system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth
multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more
comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to
fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a
profound impact on human society. Our code is available at:

Result: 实验结果表明，VistaWise在各种开放世界任务中实现了最先进的性能，显著降低了开发成本的同时提升了智能体性能。

Conclusion: VistaWise通过跨模态知识整合和高效的数据利用策略，有效解决了LLM在具身决策任务中领域知识缺乏的问题，为低成本高性能的智能体开发提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs
while enhancing agent performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体偏置缓解系统，通过专门化智能体优化信息源选择，在保持相关性的同时大幅减少LLM检索中的偏置


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型和智能体AI系统继承了内部和外部信息源的偏置，这影响了检索信息的公平性和平衡性，降低了用户信任

Method: 设计了一个偏置缓解智能体（Bias Mitigation Agent）多智能体系统，通过专门化智能体协调工作流程，优化信息源选择

Result: 实验结果显示，与基线朴素检索策略相比，偏置减少了81.82%

Conclusion: 该方法能有效促进公平和平衡的知识传播，确保检索内容既高度相关又偏置最小

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

TL;DR: CAC-CoT是一种限制连接词使用的紧凑思维链方法，在保持System-1任务性能的同时提升System-2任务表现，推理长度减少约三分之二


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长思维链在快速直觉性System-1任务上性能下降的问题，同时保持复杂System-2任务的推理能力

Method: Connector-Aware Compact CoT方法，限制推理过程使用固定的少量连接词短语，引导模型生成简洁结构化的解释

Result: 在GSM8K上达到约85%，GPQA上约40%，同时保持S1-Bench约90%的性能；推理长度平均约300词，比基线减少三分之二

Conclusion: CAC-CoT方法通过限制连接词实现了高效且准确的推理，在保持System-1性能的同时显著提升了System-2任务的效率

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

TL;DR: REMO是一个新颖的提示优化框架，通过记忆增强的反思RAG模块和自适应优化器，解决了现有方法缺乏历史经验积累和容易过拟合的问题，在数学推理任务上实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前提示优化方法（如TextGrad）通常是状态无关的，缺乏历史优化经验的保存和利用机制，且容易过拟合，泛化能力差。

Method: 提出了REMO框架，包含：(1) 记忆增强的反思RAG模块（"错误笔记本"结构），(2) 自适应性优化器（LLM驱动的元控制器），通过合成epoch级别的反思洞察来迭代改进系统级提示策略。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理基准测试中，相比TextGrad基线，REMO实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能，但计算开销有所增加。

Conclusion: REMO框架不仅支持类似TextGrad的局部细粒度提示调优，还能系统性地积累和重用跨运行优化知识，支持持续改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

TL;DR: 提出PAF-KIP方法解决开放集测试时适应问题，通过主辅助过滤器和知识集成预测来提升闭集精度和开放集识别能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实测试数据常存在领域偏移和开放集样本，现有方法依赖源模型过滤导致性能下降，而适应模型本身不稳定会导致错误累积

Method: PAF（主辅助过滤器）用辅助过滤器验证主过滤器结果；KIP（知识集成预测）整合适应模型、EMA模型和源模型的互补知识进行校准

Result: 在多个闭集和开放集数据集上验证，方法在闭集精度和开放集判别能力上均优于现有方法

Conclusion: PAF-KIP方法有效解决了开放集测试时适应中的过滤不准确和知识整合问题，提升了模型在真实场景下的性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/powerpowe/PAF-KIP-OSTTA .

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了拒绝回答率，同时保持了整体推理性能

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型推理模型在不可回答问题上的拒绝回答能力不足问题，为构建更可信的AI系统提供了解决方案

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in language
models through token-level multi-model collaboration. Our approach selects the
optimal tokens from the next token distributions provided by multiple models to
perform autoregressive reasoning. Contrary to the assumption that more models
yield better results, we introduce a distribution distance-based dynamic
selection strategy (DDS) to optimize the multi-model collaboration process. To
address the critical challenge of vocabulary misalignment in multi-model
collaboration, we propose the concept of minimal complete semantic units
(MCSU), which is simple yet enables multiple language models to achieve natural
alignment within the linguistic space. Experimental results across various
benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code will be

Conclusion: CausalMACE框架通过引入因果关系有效提升了多智能体系统的协作效率和任务完成能力

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STARec是一个慢思维增强的推荐系统框架，通过双阶段认知建模（快速响应+慢速推理）和锚定强化训练，显著提升了推荐性能，仅用0.4%的训练数据就超越了现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统受限于静态用户建模和被动决策范式，LLM代理过度依赖启发式模式匹配，存在浅层相关偏差、有限因果推理和稀疏数据脆弱性等问题。

Method: 提出STARec框架：将用户建模为具有并行认知的代理（快速响应+慢速推理的思维链），采用锚定强化训练（两阶段范式结合结构化知识蒸馏和偏好对齐奖励塑造），通过模拟反馈循环实现动态策略适应。

Result: 在MovieLens 1M和Amazon CDs基准测试中，STARec相比最先进基线方法取得了显著性能提升，且仅使用了0.4%的完整训练数据。

Conclusion: STARec通过引入自主审慎推理能力，成功解决了传统推荐系统的局限性，为构建更智能、更鲁棒的推荐代理提供了有效框架。

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLMs在法律领域的局限性，定义了AI系统在司法决策中作为可靠推理工具所需的核心能力，并评估了RAG、多智能体系统等AI增强机制在满足法律推理要求方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被整合到专业领域，其在法律等高风险领域的局限性仍未得到充分理解。研究旨在明确AI系统在司法决策中作为可靠推理工具所需具备的核心能力。

Method: 使用IRAC（问题-规则-应用-结论）模型作为分析框架，重点关注法律裁决中最具挑战性的阶段：确定适用规则（R）和将规则应用于案件事实（A）。从司法角度解构法律推理的核心要求，并评估各种AI增强机制（如RAG、多智能体系统、神经符号AI）满足这些要求的潜力。

Result: 研究发现，虽然这些技术可以解决特定挑战，但在需要自由裁量权和透明、可论证推理的任务中仍存在重大挑战。当前AI在法律中最有效的角色是双重的：作为简单重复案件的高容量助手，以及作为复杂事务中人类专家的复杂"陪练伙伴"。

Conclusion: AI在法律领域的最佳应用方式是作为简单案件的高效处理工具和复杂案件的专家辅助系统，而非完全替代人类法官的专业判断和自由裁量能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

Conclusion: 动态评估对于推进协作代码生成代理的发展至关重要，能够提供更细粒度的诊断洞察

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

Conclusion: FormaRL证明了强化学习在自动形式化任务中的有效性，仅需少量无标注数据即可显著提升性能，为自动形式化和定理证明领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong
improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source
state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%)
and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%). Training code of FormaRL is

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于层次聚类结构的最近邻方法替代神经网络，解决幻觉效应、高计算复杂度等问题，通过Kohonen自组织映射树结构加速搜索，在准确率略有下降的情况下实现数百倍的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络存在幻觉效应、高计算复杂度、昂贵微调和灾难性遗忘等根本性限制，阻碍了在医学、工业管理和科学研究等关键领域的应用，需要寻找更可靠的替代方案。

Method: 采用k最近邻算法结合层次聚类结构，使用基于Kohonen自组织映射的树状数据结构来加速最近邻搜索，避免重新训练整个网络。

Result: 在手写数字识别和简单字幕翻译任务上的测试表明，该方法在准确率仅轻微下降的情况下，将最近邻搜索时间比穷举搜索方法减少了数百倍。

Conclusion: 该方法具有透明性和可解释性，与人类认知机制高度契合，在需要高可靠性和可解释结果的任务中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于专家重要性的动态卸载方法，通过替换低重要性专家为GPU缓存中的相似专家，减少内存使用和数据传输，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在消费级边缘硬件上部署MoE模型受限于有限的内存，需要动态专家卸载技术，但现有方法仅将其视为调度问题，忽略了专家重要性对准确性的影响。

Method: 利用专家重要性指导卸载决策，用GPU内存中已缓存的功能相似专家替换低重要性激活专家，并引入最大化GPU缓存专家重用率的调度策略。

Result: 实验评估显示，该方法将解码延迟降低48%，专家缓存命中率超过60%，同时保持几乎无损的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MoE模型在边缘设备上的内存约束问题，显著提升了推理效率，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型通过纯统计学习就能在预测社会规范判断方面超越绝大多数人类，挑战了认为文化能力需要具身体验的理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社会规范如何被习得和表征的基本问题，探索语言模型是否仅通过统计学习就能获得复杂的社会规范理解。

Method: 通过两个研究，系统评估多个AI系统预测555个日常场景中人类社会适当性判断的能力，比较模型预测与人类平均判断的接近程度。

Result: GPT-4.5在连续尺度上预测集体判断的准确率超过所有人类参与者（100百分位），其他模型也表现优异，但都存在系统性的相关错误。

Conclusion: 统计学习单独就能产生复杂的社会认知模型，语言作为文化知识传递的丰富储存库，但基于模式的社会理解存在潜在边界。

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI向通用智能发展，需要从静态任务优化转向创建能够连续学习的开放式代理。

Method: 基于四大核心原则：经验探索、长期记忆、技能学习和知识内化。并提出StuLife标准数据集，模拟大学生全面发展过程。

Result: 构建了一个维护持久记忆、获取实用技能的动态环境，为评估终身学习能力提供了综合平台。

Conclusion: ELL框架和StuLife数据集为开放式代理的连续学习提供了重要支撑，也探索了上下文工程在推进AGI中的作用。

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在现象学定性分析中的应用潜力，特别是在边缘型人格障碍这种涉及时间性和自我性障碍的复杂心理状态分析中，以减轻人类解释偏见。

Method: 基于24名住院患者的生活故事访谈数据，让三种LLM模仿原始研究者的解释风格进行分析，采用盲法和非盲法专家评估，包括语义一致性、Jaccard系数和多维有效性评分。

Result: 模型与人类分析的重合度差异较大（GPT 0%、Claude 42%、Gemini 58%），Jaccard系数较低（0.21-0.28），但模型发现了人类遗漏的主题。Gemini的有效性评分显著高于其他模型，且被盲审专家判断为人类分析。

Conclusion: AI增强的主题分析具有可变性和潜力，能够减轻人类解释偏见，特别是在处理复杂心理现象时，Gemini模型表现出最接近人类分析的能力。

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

Motivation: 传统人工标注主观性强，现有NLP方法在代数等符号领域失效，需要客观且领域无关的问题难度确定方法。

Method: 使用强化学习多臂老虎机框架，利用变异系数的倒数作为风险调整指标，仅基于解题表现数据（分数和时间）进行难度估计。

Result: 在三个异构数据集上验证，平均R²达0.9213，平均RMSE为0.0584，优于回归、NLP和IRT等基线方法，在符号领域表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: 该方法领域无关、自监督，可推广到其他有解题交互数据的领域，支持维果茨基最近发展区理论，平衡挑战性与可达性。

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

Motivation: 现有评估任务无法全面测试LLM在交互式未知环境中的综合推理能力，忽略了人类发现真实世界所需的整合推理过程

Method: 引入黑盒交互评估范式，定义黑盒为隐藏的输入输出映射函数，要求LLM通过有限交互轮次探索并推理黑盒背后的函数规律

Result: 构建Oracle基准测试19个现代LLM，o3在6个任务中5个排名第一，简单黑盒准确率超70%，但困难任务平均性能低于40%

Conclusion: LLM普遍缺乏高层规划能力来制定高效自适应的探索策略进行假设精炼，这是当前推理能力的主要瓶颈

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

Conclusion: 该方法支持Minsky的心智社会概念，为人工智能研究开辟了新途径，表明通过简单过程的协调交互可以实现复杂认知能力。

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues
for artificial intelligence research. The source code for our work is available

Motivation: 现有后训练方法在复杂数学任务中难以捕捉深层程序逻辑，研究发现训练数据难度存在缩放定律——过多低难度数据阻碍抽象能力，而高难度数据显著增强推理能力。

Method: 提出SST框架：1）使用结构化解决方案模板链和动态加权损失进行微调；2）推理时注入解决方案模板作为认知支架；3）集成课程微调，明确教导模型自我规划-执行-校正。

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME24和Dynamic En基准测试中，SST显著提高了准确性和效率，特别是在更难的问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: SST框架通过结构化模板和难度课程有效解决了大语言模型在程序推理方面的局限性，为复杂数学问题的解决提供了新思路。

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from

deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We
propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric
quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence
thresholds. We introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent incorporating
stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on
MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under
strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare

The survey critically assesses current evaluation methodologies for medical

Method: 基于Natural Questions自动生成HDS-QA合成数据集，包含可并行独立子查询和顺序依赖子查询的混合跳问题，并微调LRM模型HybridDeepSearcher

Result: 在多个基准测试中超越最先进基线，在FanOutQA和BrowseComp子集上分别提升15.9和11.5 F1分数，推理延迟显著降低

Conclusion: 显式训练LRM利用混合并行和顺序查询具有高效性、可扩展性和有效性，能以更少搜索轮次达到相当精度

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

Motivation: 随着学习系统对日常决策影响日益增强，用户端的算法集体行动（ACA）作为监管端政策和企业端模型设计的补充手段变得重要。传统ACA研究主要关注单一集体，但现实中行动往往是分散的、由多个具有共同目标但策略不同的集体进行的。

Method: 建立了多集体ACA的理论框架，特别关注分类任务中的集体行动，研究多个集体如何通过植入信号（即让分类器学习特征修改版本与目标类别之间的关联）来影响系统。

Result: 提供了关于集体规模和目标一致性在ACA中作用和相互影响的定量分析结果，补充了先前的实证研究。

Conclusion: 该框架为多集体ACA的整体研究开辟了路径，为理解分散式集体行动如何协同影响算法系统提供了理论基础。

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出游戏风格作为分析智能体决策行为的新视角，建立了风格形成的双层框架，提出了可测量的风格指标，并探讨了风格在强化学习、模仿学习和游戏设计等领域的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI发展主要关注理性决策，但现实世界中智能体的决策还受到信念、价值观和偏好等深层因素的影响。人类决策风格的多样性表明"风格"是智能的重要但常被忽视的维度。

Method: 构建风格形成的双层框架（外部环境交互循环和内部认知思考循环），形式化风格相关特征，提出风格容量、风格流行度和进化动力学等可测量指标。研究包括风格定义测量、风格表达生成以及实际应用三个核心方向。

Result: 提出了基于离散状态空间的通用游戏风格度量方法，可量化策略多样性和竞争平衡；探索了使用强化学习和模仿学习训练具有特定风格倾向的智能体；开发了人类风格学习和建模的新方法。

Conclusion: 游戏风格为分析智能体决策行为提供了新视角，在游戏设计和交互娱乐等领域具有应用潜力。风格可能成为构建人工通用智能（AGI）的核心要素，未来需要进一步扩展研究。

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MATRIX是一个用于临床对话系统安全评估的多智能体仿真框架，整合了安全对齐的临床场景分类、基于LLM的安全评估器BehvJudge和模拟患者代理PatBot，实现了系统性、可扩展的安全评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型临床对话系统评估主要关注任务完成度和流畅性，缺乏对安全关键系统所需的行为和风险管理要求的深入分析，需要开发专门的安全导向评估框架。

Method: MATRIX框架包含三个核心组件：1）基于安全工程方法的安全对齐临床场景分类体系；2）BehvJudge评估器（基于LLM）用于检测安全相关对话故障；3）PatBot模拟患者代理生成多样化场景响应。

Result: BehvJudge在240个对话的盲评中达到专家级危险检测水平（F1 0.96，灵敏度0.999），优于临床医生。PatBot在定量和定性评估中可靠地模拟真实患者行为。在2,100个模拟对话中成功对5个LLM代理进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: MATRIX是首个将结构化安全工程与可扩展、经过验证的对话AI评估相统一的框架，支持监管机构对齐的安全审计，为临床对话系统的安全评估提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured
scenarios, and datasets.

Conclusion: 这种现代思维机器为增强科学创造力提供了有效途径，并展示了人类与AI在构思过程中协作的可能性。

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

TL;DR: 将逐步奖励建模从分类任务重构为推理任务，提出生成式评判模型StepWiser，通过强化学习训练，在中间步骤判断准确性、策略模型训练改进和推理时搜索方面表现更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型存在两个主要缺陷：作为分类器不提供解释，且依赖静态数据集的监督微调限制了泛化能力

Method: 提出生成式评判模型StepWiser，通过元推理对策略模型的推理步骤进行思考，输出思考标记后再给出最终判断，使用强化学习和rollout相对结果进行训练

Result: 在中间步骤判断准确性上优于现有方法，可用于改进策略模型训练，并提升推理时搜索效果

Conclusion: 将逐步奖励建模重构为推理任务的方法有效解决了现有过程奖励模型的局限性，在多个方面展现出优越性能

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联设备、自主系统和AI应用的快速发展导致自适应传输系统严重碎片化，不同协议和上下文源相互隔离，需要统一的集成框架。

Method: 通过分析现有文献，提出五类分类法（自适应机制、上下文感知框架、统一模型、集成策略和MCP架构），系统调查MCP作为统一范式的能力。

Result: 发现传统传输协议已达到孤立适应的极限，MCP的客户端-服务器和JSON-RPC结构能够实现语义互操作性，AI驱动的传输需要特别适合MCP的集成范式。

Conclusion: MCP应作为下一代自适应、上下文感知和智能传输基础设施的基础，并提出了相应的研究路线图。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,
and intelligent transport infrastructures.

*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种协作式框架，通过分布式深度学习技术来分割缪血性脑梗止伤痕，解决了单一医疗机构数据不足和模型普遍性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑梗止是全球第二大死因和第三大游病因，但传统的计算辅助识别方法存在中心化数据集限制、模型普遍性差、标注数据缺乏等挑战。

Method: 采用联邦学习技术(FedAvg)，通过14个模拟医疗中心的2031个案例进行协作训练，共享深度学习表征而不共享敏感数据。

Result: 模型在所有中心平均DSC指标达到0.71±0.24，显著超过了中心化训练和其他联邦学习策略。模型呈现出强大的普适性，在分布外数据上仍能达到DSC 0.64±0.29的性能。

Conclusion: 该协作式框架能够有效解决医疗数据集中的数据局限性问题，提高了缪血性脑梗止伤痕分割的准确性和普适性，为临床应用提供了可靠的计算支持。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Motivation: 现有的sRGB域扩散模型处理有损的sRGB输入，忽略了传感器RAW图像在许多场景（如边缘设备图像视频采集）中的可访问性，导致性能次优。

Method: 提出RAW域VAE学习最优潜在表示，可微分后色调处理模块实现RAW和sRGB空间联合优化，开发可扩展的退化管道从现有sRGB数据集合成RAW LQ-HQ对进行大规模训练，设计可配置多拜耳LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式。

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法，产生更高保真度且伪影更少的结果。

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域进行图像恢复，成功解决了sRGB域扩散模型的局限性，为边缘设备图像处理提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电磁信号具有高度异质性、强背景噪声和复杂时频结构，现有通用模型无法直接应用，且缺乏跨任务泛化和高质量数据集。

Method: 构建首个统一标准化电磁信号数据集，采用长度自适应多信号打包方法和硬件感知训练策略，利用电磁信号物理特性进行高效表示学习。

Result: EMind在多个下游任务中表现出强大性能和广泛泛化能力，实现了从任务特定模型到统一电磁智能框架的转变。

Conclusion: EMind成功建立了电磁信号基础模型，为动态频谱管理、智能交通和无人系统感知提供了统一的解决方案框架。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:
