To address this issue, this study proposes an\nadaptive many-objective evolutionary algorithm with a simplified hypervolume\nindicator. It synthesizes indicator assessment techniques with\ndecomposition-based methods to facilitate self-adaptive and dynamic adjustment\nof the weight vectors in many-objective optimization methods. Specifically,\nbased on the MOEA/D framework, it uses a simplified hypervolume indicator to\naccurately assess solution distribution.

However, this\ntwo-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall\nreconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework\nthat directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a\nphysics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically\ngrounded and visually aligned with the input video.

In\nprinciple, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such\nas pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic\nfeatures offer an edge in distilled fields?

We propose GeoComplete,\na novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce\ngeometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior\nimage-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the\ndiffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,\nand applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference\ncues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch\nsynthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other\nextracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint\nself-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To\naddress regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the\ntarget view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked\nduring training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful\ncues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios.

PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in\nterms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and\ntheir continuous counterparts.

To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate\nnatural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency\nwhen revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must\ncompress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which\nexposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,\nwhereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene\ngeneration quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.\nWe present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols\nwith a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct\ngameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during\nexploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward\nTraining extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained\npredictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial\nmemory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently\nretrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,\nwhile Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior\nlong-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse\nenvironments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended\nsequences."}

Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to\nthe input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them\nbefore mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a\nclosed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network\narchitectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for\nspecific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,\narchitecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show\nstate-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,\nestablish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including\nstereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and\npracticality.
