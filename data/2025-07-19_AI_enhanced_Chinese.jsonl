To address these\nchallenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a\npre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data\nvia delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an\nadvanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a\nmultimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an\ninnovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize\nits visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves\ncompetitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively\nexpensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper\nand stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++\nintroduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and\nre-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,\nit includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these\ndesigns, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,\nwhile still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate\nour approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results\ndemonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out\nof 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared\nto its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves\nsimilar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Mono-InternVL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMono-InternVL\u548cMono-InternVL-1.5\u4e24\u79cd\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6a21\u6001MLLM\u5b58\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08EViP\u53caEViP++\uff09\u3002", "result": "Mono-InternVL\u572815\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d12\u9879\u9886\u5148\uff0cMono-InternVL-1.5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u6a21\u6001MLLM\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Preprint", "summary": "Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial\ndata, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the\nfirst comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,\nencompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer\nlearning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,\nwe conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite\nimage-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise\nclassification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of\nvaried training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified\noptimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.\nThe evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural\nsites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from\nCDL trusted pixels and field surveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval\npreprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal\nperformance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid\ntraining and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and\ndirect transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques\nenhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop\nclasses while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,\nworkflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a\nsufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate\nand generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that\nmatches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop\nmapping.

These currents play a crucial role in mediating\nvertical exchange between the surface and ocean interior and in facilitating\ncross-scale energy transfers. Despite a growing understanding of their\ngeneration mechanisms and energy pathways, two fundamental questions remain\nunresolved - how does a finite Ro modify the dynamics of ML instabilities, and\nwhat mechanisms are responsible for ML frontal arrest when Ro is order one. In\nthis study, we address these questions through a linear stability analysis of a\ntwo-dimensional, geostrophically adjusted oceanic front based on the analytical\nmodel of Ou(1984), which allows systematic exploration across a range of Ro. In\nthe low Ro, order one Ri regime, the most unstable mode is that of baroclinic\ninstability, with the buoyancy flux serving as the primary source of\nperturbation kinetic energy.

This paper presents FORTRESS\n(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a\nnew architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method\nthat combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold\nNetwork integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic\ndepthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction\nper layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function\ncomposition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and\nmulti-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced\nfeatures across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency\ngains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity\nreduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while\ndelivering superior segmentation performance.

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24.

To address the data collection challenges posed by this\nparadigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety\nrisks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a\nscalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $\n30\\times $ compared to human teleoperation.

We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module\nto verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation\ntasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%\nimprovement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in\ndownstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using\nreplay-based video validation.

An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking.

But how close\nare they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can\ntackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific\nunderstanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn\naway from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on\nreal-life research problems.\n  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph\ntheory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of\nfrontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of\nreasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of\ncommercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,\nsuch as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is\ngenerated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)\nlogic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;\nideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately\nrelated to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central\nconjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH).

Fortunately,\nfoundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong\npotential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which\npromotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in\nlong-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual\nencoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,\noverlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we\npropose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for\nlong-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance\nderived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.\nSpecifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as\nsemantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder.

This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with\napplications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological\nmonitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86SMOT4SB\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807SO-HOTA\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7ade\u8d5b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff08SMOT\uff09\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u6781\u5c11\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u5173\u8054\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u5e27\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSMOT4SB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001SO-HOTA\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3e\u529eMVA2025\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b211\u4e2a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c108,192\u6807\u6ce8\u5e27\uff1bSO-HOTA\u7ed3\u5408Dot Distance\u4e0eHOTA\uff1b\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53475.1\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684SMOT\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u9e1f\u51fb\u907f\u514d\u3001\u519c\u4e1a\u7b49\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Owing to\nCLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing\ninterest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on\ntask-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting\nin suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,\nwe propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and\nEnsemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the\nattention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain\nshifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated\ntarget domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the\nattention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE\nutilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant\nattention maps between the source data and the simulated target data.

Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)\nmethods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative\nnature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,\nleading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a\nDMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise\nPower-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned\nEquivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute\nquantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall\nquantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having\nsmall quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error\naccumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to\nprioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that\nlayers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we\nintroduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust\nselection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting\nalgorithm that enhances reliability.

However, diagnosing these conditions\nis time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents\na promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a\nnotable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one\nmodality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse\nand plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to\naddress the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely\nlimited dataset.

Finally, a\ntransformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable\nprecise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior\ndetector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater\nrobustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy\nand generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone\nDINOv2 coarse features.

However, domain shifts often undermine model\nreliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and\nsafety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating\ntarget domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance\nwithout ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient\nrobustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While\nprevious work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,\nthese methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper\nfirst adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image\nclassification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the\nlimitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane\nfeatures, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework\n(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image\nencoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane\ndetection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the\nOpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),\ndemonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE\nof 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727.

VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning.

However,\ninterrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual\nuni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an\nuncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of\nlarge-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty\npropagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the\nrelationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and\njoint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting\nof cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be\noptimised robustly with a few samples.

The absence of ground truths for\nunknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have\naddressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently\nproposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)\nis a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown\nobjects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness.

This paper introduces a registration-based\nanomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with\ncluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.\nSpecifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal\nprototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a\nlocal level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is\ncomputed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each\ncluster.

To generate data via a flow matching model, an\nordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward\nintegration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality\nthat is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was\nrecently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically\nintegrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the\nmulti-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of\nmodeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model\nmulti-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution\nremains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how\nto gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels\nof the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch\ncouplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on\nsynthetic and imaging data.
