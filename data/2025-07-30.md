### [1] [Reservoir Computation with Networks of Differentiating Neuron Ring Oscillators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21377)

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小世界图的微分神经元网络作为储层计算的新方法，替代传统的积分神经元网络，并在MNIST任务中取得了90.65%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统储层计算依赖积分神经元网络，需要持续电流维持活动，而微分神经元网络仅在输入变化时激活，可能为高能耗AI应用提供可持续替代方案。

Method: 构建小世界图的微分神经元网络，研究其耦合强度和拓扑结构，以验证其作为储层计算基质的有效性。

Result: 在MNIST数字识别任务中，微分神经元网络表现与现有储层计算方法相当，准确率达90.65%。

Conclusion: 微分神经元网络可作为积分神经元网络的潜在替代方案，为高能耗AI应用提供可持续解决方案。

Abstract: Reservoir Computing is a machine learning approach that uses the rich
repertoire of complex system dynamics for function approximation. Current
approaches to reservoir computing use a network of coupled integrating neurons
that require a steady current to maintain activity. Here, we introduce a small
world graph of differentiating neurons that are active only when there are
changes in input as an alternative to integrating neurons as a reservoir
computing substrate. We find the coupling strength and network topology that
enable these small world networks to function as an effective reservoir. We
demonstrate the efficacy of these networks in the MNIST digit recognition task,
achieving comparable performance of 90.65% to existing reservoir computing
approaches. The findings suggest that differentiating neurons can be a
potential alternative to integrating neurons and can provide a sustainable
future alternative for power-hungry AI applications.

### [2] [Hebbian Memory-Augmented Recurrent Networks: Engram Neurons in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21474)
*Daniel Szelogowski*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型循环神经网络架构ENN，结合了显式记忆矩阵和Hebbian可塑性，提升了模型的解释性和长程依赖建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有循环神经网络依赖隐式记忆，限制了其解释性和长程依赖建模能力。受生物神经系统的启发，作者希望通过引入显式记忆和Hebbian可塑性改进这些问题。

Method: ENN架构包含显式、可微的记忆矩阵，结合Hebbian可塑性和稀疏注意力驱动的检索机制，动态建模记忆形成与回忆。

Result: ENN在MNIST、CIFAR-10和WikiText-103任务上表现与经典RNN、GRU和LSTM相当，同时显著提升了模型的解释性。

Conclusion: ENN通过神经科学启发的机制，为开发更可解释和稳健的深度学习模型提供了潜力。

Abstract: Despite success across diverse tasks, current artificial recurrent network
architectures rely primarily on implicit hidden-state memories, limiting their
interpretability and ability to model long-range dependencies. In contrast,
biological neural systems employ explicit, associative memory traces (i.e.,
engrams) strengthened through Hebbian synaptic plasticity and activated
sparsely during recall. Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we
introduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture
incorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity
and sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models
memory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving
transparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We
evaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit
classification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language
modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and
generalization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM
architectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on
the large-scale WikiText-103 task. At the same time, the ENN offers significant
enhancements in interpretability through observable memory dynamics. Hebbian
trace visualizations further reveal biologically plausible, structured memory
formation processes, validating the potential of neuroscience-inspired
mechanisms to inform the development of more interpretable and robust deep
learning models.

### [3] [Knowledge-Guided Memetic Algorithm for Capacitated Arc Routing Problems with Time-Dependent Service Costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21740)
*Qingya Li,Shengcai Liu,Wenjie Chen,Juan Zou,Ke Tang,Xin Yao*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种知识引导的遗传算法（KGMA-GN），用于解决时间依赖性服务成本的容量弧路由问题（CARPTDSC），通过两种知识引导策略提高了搜索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CARPTDSC是一个NP难问题，且时间依赖性服务成本增加了计算负担，现有算法效率有限。

Method: 提出了知识引导的初始化策略（KGIS）和小步长局部搜索策略（KGSLSS），以减少无效移动和节省计算时间。

Result: 在五个基准测试集上，KGMA-GN的搜索效率优于现有方法，局部搜索算子的速度提升超过十倍。

Conclusion: KGMA-GN通过知识引导策略显著提高了CARPTDSC问题的求解效率。

Abstract: The capacitated arc routing problem with time-dependent service costs
(CARPTDSC) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that arises from
winter gritting applications. CARPTDSC has two main challenges about time
consumption. First, it is an NP-hard problem. Second, the time-dependent
service costs of tasks require frequent evaluations during the search process,
significantly increasing computational effort. These challenges make it
difficult for existing algorithms to perform efficient searches, often
resulting in limited efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
knowledge-guided memetic algorithm with golden section search and negatively
correlated search (KGMA-GN), where two knowledge-guided strategies are
introduced to improve search efficiency. First, a knowledge-guided
initialization strategy (KGIS) is proposed to generate high-quality initial
solutions to speed up convergence. Second, a knowledge-guided small-step-size
local search strategy (KGSLSS) is proposed to filter out invalid moves, thereby
reducing unnecessary evaluations and saving the computation time. Experimental
results on five benchmark test sets, including both small- and larger-scale
instances, demonstrate that KGMA-GN achieves higher search efficiency than the
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study further confirms that
the knowledge-guided local search operators in KGSLSS can significantly reduce
runtime compared to traditional operators, especially for the knowledge-guided
swap operator, which achieves more than a tenfold improvement in speed.

### [4] [GAITEX: Human motion dataset from impaired gait and rehabilitation exercises of inertial and optical sensor data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21069)
*Andreas Spilz,Heiko Oppel,Jochen Werner,Kathrin Stucke-Straub,Felix Capanni,Michael Munz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个多模态数据集，用于开发和评估基于IMU和MoCap的机器学习模型，支持康复训练和步态分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发稳健的传感器分类模型需要大量多样化的数据，但收集这些数据成本高且耗时。

Method: 通过19名参与者记录同步的IMU和MoCap数据，提供原始和处理后的数据、OpenSim模型及分析工具。

Result: 数据集包含详细的注释和工具，支持机器学习任务如自动运动评估和步态分析。

Conclusion: 该数据集旨在加速机器学习驱动的人类运动分析研究。

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise
evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical
parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for
postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation,
and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in
machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

### [5] [Seeing Beyond Frames: Zero-Shot Pedestrian Intention Prediction with Raw Temporal Video and Multimodal Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21161)
*Pallavi Zambare,Venkata Nikhil Thanikella,Ying Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BF-PIP是一种零样本方法，通过处理连续视频片段和结构化元数据，无需额外训练即可预测行人意图，准确率73%，优于GPT-4V基线18%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在复杂城市环境中需要大量重新训练的问题，提升行人意图预测的适应性。

Method: 基于Gemini 2.5 Pro，利用连续视频片段和JAAD元数据，结合边界框标注和自车速度的多模态提示。

Result: 零样本下达到73%的预测准确率，比GPT-4V基线高18%。

Conclusion: 结合时间视频输入和上下文线索能提升时空感知，为智能交通系统提供无需重新训练的敏捷感知模块。

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.

### [6] [ChartM$^3$: Benchmarking Chart Editing with Multimodal Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21167)
*Danglu Yang,Liang Zhang,Zihao Yue,Liangyu Chen,Yichen Xu,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态图表编辑新范式，结合自然语言和视觉指示器表达用户意图，并引入了ChartM3基准和训练集，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表编辑方法主要依赖自然语言指令，但语言模糊性限制了细粒度编辑。因此，需要一种结合视觉指示的多模态方法。

Method: 提出多模态图表编辑范式，结合自然语言和视觉指示器；构建ChartM3基准和ChartM3-Train训练集，用于评估和训练模型。

Result: 实验显示当前多模态大语言模型（如GPT-4o）在视觉指示理解上存在局限，但通过ChartM3-Train微调后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 多模态监督对图表编辑系统至关重要，ChartM3为未来研究提供了有价值的资源和工具。

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

*Soren Pedersen,Sanyam Jain,Mikkel Chavez,Viktor Ladehoff,Bruna Neves de Freitas,Ruben Pauwels*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种用于合成牙科全景X光片的生成对抗网络（GAN），旨在解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。通过使用Wasserstein损失和梯度惩罚（WGANGP）训练DCGAN，并对四种候选模型进行评估，研究发现未去噪数据训练的模型在细节表现上更优，而去噪数据训练的模型在整体清晰度上更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 使用Wasserstein损失和梯度惩罚（WGANGP）训练DCGAN，对四种候选模型（通过改变批评器迭代次数、特征深度和去噪预处理）进行评估。

Result: 未去噪数据训练的模型在细节表现（如下颌管和骨小梁）上更优，而去噪数据训练的模型在整体清晰度和锐度上更好。

Conclusion: 为基于GAN的牙科影像方法提供了未来研究的基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

### [8] [On Explaining Visual Captioning with Hybrid Markov Logic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21246)
*Monika Shah,Somdeb Sarkhel,Deepak Venugopal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合马尔可夫逻辑网络（HMLNs）的新解释框架，用于解释深度神经网络在多模态任务（如图像描述）中的决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DNN在多模态任务中表现优异，但其如何整合视觉、语言和知识表示以生成有意义的描述仍难以解释。现有性能指标通常仅比较生成描述与人工描述，无法深入揭示模型内部机制。

Method: 通过HMLNs结合符号规则与实值函数，学习训练实例的分布，并在生成样本条件下推断分布变化，量化哪些训练实例对生成描述贡献更大。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能提供可解释的解释，并比较不同图像描述模型在可解释性方面的表现。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解DNN在多模态任务中的决策提供了新视角，增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

*Ankit Singh,Efstratios Gavves,Cees G. M. Snoek,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于时空动作定位的半监督学习方法，通过双引导网络选择更好的伪边界框，显著提升了有限标注数据下的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督学习在图像分类中已有广泛应用，但在时空动作定位领域的研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入双引导网络，结合帧级分类和边界框预测，确保动作类别在帧和框之间的一致性。

Result: 在UCF101-24、J-HMDB-21和AVA数据集上表现优异，优于基于图像的半监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在有限标注数据下显著提升了时空动作定位的性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the
predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to
obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the
context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised
approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance
network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level
classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class
consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known
spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and
AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's
performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior
results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

*Christopher Indris,Raiyan Rahman,Goetz Bramesfeld,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了航空野生动物追踪中的小目标检测问题，通过数据增强和比较三种目标检测模型，发现简单模型在有限计算资源下表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空野生动物追踪需要高效的小目标检测方法，但现有技术面临成本高、计算资源有限等挑战。

Method: 采用数据增强（分块）方法，比较三种目标检测模型在不同分块配置下的性能。

Result: 所有模型在至少一种分块配置下达到93%以上的mAP@IoU=0.5，简单模型表现与复杂模型相当。

Conclusion: 研究支持在有限计算资源的无人机上部署高效的小目标检测模型。

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on
detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical
challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous
drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the
objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection
is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by
computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to
datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study
of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using
the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection
accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one
patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on
the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models
are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this
task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

### [11] [HDR Environment Map Estimation with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21261)
*Jack Hilliard,Adrian Hilton,Jean-Yves Guillemaut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新方法，用于从单视角图像估计HDR环境贴图，解决了ERP表示中的边界伪影问题，并通过全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）提升了质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ERP表示在环境贴图中产生的极区失真和边界伪影问题，提升单视角图像生成环境贴图的质量和准确性。

Method: 1. 提出ERP卷积填充技术消除边界伪影；2. 设计全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）以减少ERP失真。

Result: 模型在标准基准测试中表现优异，生成的环境贴图在图像质量和光照准确性上与现有最优方法竞争。

Conclusion: 通过LDM和PanoDiT的结合，成功提升了单视角图像生成HDR环境贴图的质量，尽管PanoDiT在图像真实感上有所牺牲。

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view
image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model
(LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light
mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation,
the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles
and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam
artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder.
Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network
architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the
estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions
and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate
with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality
environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in
both image quality and lighting accuracy.

### [12] [Fairness and Robustness of CLIP-Based Models for Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21291)
*Théo Sourget,David Restrepo,Céline Hudelot,Enzo Ferrante,Stergios Christodoulidis,Maria Vakalopoulou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了六种基于CLIP的模型在胸部X光分类任务中的公平性和鲁棒性，发现模型在不同年龄患者间存在性能差距，但对其他属性表现较公平。模型还显示出对虚假相关性的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于CLIP的模型在医学任务中表现出色，但其公平性和鲁棒性尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用三个公开数据集（MIMIC-CXR、NIH-CXR14、NEATX）评估六种CLIP模型，分析其在不同患者亚组（年龄、性别、种族）中的公平性，并测试对虚假相关性的鲁棒性。

Result: 模型在不同年龄患者间性能差距明显，但对性别和种族表现较公平。所有模型在无胸引管的病例中性能下降，表明依赖虚假相关性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CLIP模型在医学任务中的公平性和鲁棒性问题，强调了进一步优化和评估的必要性。

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural
image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical
tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and
reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown
encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their
fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely
underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used
CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across
six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,
we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on
pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate
performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results
for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on
images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We
further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings
generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified
from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the
limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models. Our code
is available at https://github.com/TheoSourget/clip_cxr_fairness

TL;DR: 提出一种实时从2D摄像头生成3D高斯重建的方法，提升虚拟3D会议的真实性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D会议解决方案依赖复杂硬件或固定外观，不适合视频会议应用。

Method: 通过独立处理每帧视频，结合稳定性损失函数，实现实时3D重建。

Result: 在视觉质量和稳定性上优于现有方法，仅需普通2D摄像头即可实现3D会议。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D视频会议提供了高可访问性、真实性和稳定性的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase
engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to
standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a
challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware,
making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained
generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and
ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to
predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed,
where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic
to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame
independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the
captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing
realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss
to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We
show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and
stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in
live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This
demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically,
via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but
also realistic and authentic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种全局到局部连通性保持（GLCP）框架，用于解决管状结构分割中的结构断裂问题，通过交互式多头分割（IMS）模块和双注意力细化（DAR）模块提升分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管状结构（如血管网络）的准确分割在医学领域至关重要，但现有方法常忽略局部不连续区域，导致分割效果不佳。

Method: GLCP框架结合IMS模块学习全局分割、骨架图和局部不连续图，并通过DAR模块进一步细化分割结果。

Result: 在2D和3D数据集上的实验表明，GLCP在管状结构分割中优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和连续性。

Conclusion: GLCP框架通过全局与局部特征的联合学习，显著提升了管状结构分割的质量。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays
a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge
in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream
applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss
functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often
overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation
results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local
Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive
global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,
we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn
global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.
This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while
maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight
Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation
quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on
both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy
and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several
state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at
https://github.com/FeixiangZhou/GLCP.

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation
between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of
conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of
conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in
understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort.
Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in
a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to
human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We
use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet
and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial
results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish
with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising
direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

Conclusion: 方法显著减少重建时间，适合临床实时应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality.
However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to
increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the
potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior
subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.
Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan
to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a
novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an
initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a
transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a
longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18
subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics
confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI
reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed
improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our
approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time
compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it
more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with
this work is publicly available at

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

Motivation: 现有BEV方法忽略环境上下文信息，导致检测器无法全面感知物理世界特征。

Method: 提出CoP框架，包括LDO生成密集占用真值、VHS策略提取局部特征、CFF模块融合全局-局部特征。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到49.5% mAP和59.2% NDS，优于现有视觉方法。

Conclusion: CoP通过多任务学习和特征融合显著提升了BEV 3D检测性能。

Abstract: Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced
significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich
contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV
representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic
environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors
from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To
alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative
Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to
mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object
detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial
representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a
pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density
information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,
we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained
local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop
a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly
integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more
robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark
demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving
49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set. Code and supplementary materials are

Abstract: Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers
declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image
classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative
study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife
images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a
public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we
evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and
Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among
convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest
overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost,
raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN
(DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time
field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in
conservation settings. This work contributes to African-grounded AI research by
offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and
responsible deployment of deep learning tools for wildlife conservation.

Motivation: 解决领域泛化语义分割中因域偏移导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 引入潜在域先验（LDP），通过三个模块（LPE、DCM、DPE）建模域偏移并调整特征表示。

Result: 在多样化的城市场景中验证了PDAF的有效性。

Conclusion: PDAF通过迭代建模域偏移，显著提升了模型在未知目标域的泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model
performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting
features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain
priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a
Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of
existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF
introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this
prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.
To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and
utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain
shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the
Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the
Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate
domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion
process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design
enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature
representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and
challenging urban scenes.

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has
applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics.
This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need
for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end
model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our
method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses
volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide
a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and
structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms
baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial
arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from
schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging
top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

Motivation: 现有MLLM方法需要指令跟随数据进行监督微调，且评估生成质量时依赖文本响应分析，耗时且训练困难。LLaVA-Reward旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 直接利用MLLMs的隐藏状态处理文本-图像对，引入SkipCA模块增强视觉与文本的双向交互，支持多种偏好数据微调。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Reward通过改进的交互设计和高效微调，为文本到图像生成提供了更高效的自动评估方案。

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:
text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical
results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based
methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and
inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对推理，训练效率提升有限，ReGATE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，结合参考损失和EMA评分，选择性处理关键令牌。

Result: 在VideoLLaMA2上，ReGATE达到标准训练峰值精度，速度提升2倍，令牌使用量减少35%。

Conclusion: ReGATE在减少令牌数量的同时提升性能，适用于多模态任务。

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

Motivation: 传统地图构建模型提供确定性点估计，无法处理真实环境中的模糊性（如遮挡和缺失车道标记），因此需要一种能捕捉不确定性的方法。

Method: MapDiffusion利用扩散范式，通过迭代优化随机初始化的查询（基于BEV潜在网格），生成多个可能的地图样本，从而建模完整分布。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MapDiffusion在在线地图构建中表现最优，单样本性能提升5%，多样本聚合进一步提高了性能。不确定性估计在遮挡区域显著更高。

Conclusion: MapDiffusion通过建模完整地图分布，提升了在线向量化高清地图构建的鲁棒性和可靠性，支持自动驾驶在复杂环境中的不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

Conclusion: DuCiSC通过跨图像语义一致性和可靠伪标签选择，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the
challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In
general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency
training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive
semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of
extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled
data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al
\underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic
\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic
consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic
consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused
images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,
DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype
representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we
devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select
reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of
unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,
including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and
pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a
challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features
complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over
previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种递归视觉想象（RVI）和自适应语言对齐（ALG）技术，用于提升视觉语言导航（VLN）任务中的场景理解和语言对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLN任务中，代理因过于详细的场景表示和模糊的视觉语言对齐，导致导航决策偏离语言指令。

Method: 通过递归总结视觉感知并建模为紧凑神经网格，结合RVI和ALG技术，优化视觉过渡和语义布局的规律性。

Result: 在VLN-CE和ObjectNav任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RVI和ALG技术显著提升了VLN任务的性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to
specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic
commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for
linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational
decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene
representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their
comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to
behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose
a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual
perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic
grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as
compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are
proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions
and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric
details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to
align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components
purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate
anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and
ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Conclusion: 自监督数据集蒸馏方法能高效压缩数据并保持关键特征，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

Conclusion: ESI和ATINet有效提升了光场在低光场景下的角-时域建模能力，为目标跟踪提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature
modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative
spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments
still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,
particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly
defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the
abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this
representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce
redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an
angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking
that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues
and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can
also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature
interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale
light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object
tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object
tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field
angular-temporal modeling.

Method: 提出DAC框架，利用MLLM描述已知类别信息以适配CLIP，并通过AB-LoRA技术避免过拟合。

Result: 在四个开放集3DOR数据集上平均提升10.01% mAP，并在图像和跨数据集设置中验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAC通过简单有效的方法解决了开放集3DOR问题，展示了强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D
objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods
typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view
images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still
struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training
data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP
inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream
tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named
Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set
3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large
language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM
is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to
align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it
provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues
during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias
Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further
enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images,
DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four
open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on
image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at

Result: 实验验证了VAGU基准、GtS框架和JeAUG指标的有效性。

Conclusion: VAGU和GtS为视频异常检测提供了更全面的解决方案，JeAUG改进了传统评估的局限性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and
accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into
two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal
localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding.
Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video
anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or
dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU
(Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate
both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category,
semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide
multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we
propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by
textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of
high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation
and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric,
which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision,
overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing
labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural
network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models
necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient
sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we
introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates
uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a
differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for
effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.
Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we
demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex
feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.
Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative
analysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Cooking模型有效解决了烹饪过程可视化中的关键挑战，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of
image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each
cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating
images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to
visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes
variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct
appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic
inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of
previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in
sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization
model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances
of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve
previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to
current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the
rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and
a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the
semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the
semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and
merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged
features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous
step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of
intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in
generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种冲突抑制的深度伪造检测框架（CS-DFD），通过两个模块解决联合训练中的梯度冲突问题，提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测模型需要泛化到不断演变的伪造技术，但联合训练原始数据和在线合成伪造数据可能导致性能下降，这与传统观点矛盾。

Method: 提出CS-DFD框架，包含更新向量搜索（UVS）模块和冲突梯度减少（CGR）模块，分别优化梯度更新和特征嵌入空间。

Result: 在多个深度伪造基准测试中，CS-DFD实现了最先进的检测精度和跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: CS-DFD通过抑制梯度冲突，显著提升了深度伪造检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to
ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising
strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images
containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake
detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online
synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the
common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance
detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to
gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between
source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework
that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.
First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update
vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the
original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search
process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update
vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.
Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict
feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss
penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of
representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and
CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and
representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks
demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain
detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: 太阳传感器建模与校准需进一步研究，以优化传感器生命周期内的性能。

Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an
astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the
two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical
components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,
sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude
determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft
coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due
to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are
small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of
the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of
uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and
interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration
algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve
accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have
been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is
currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of
work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling
and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It
specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an
analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun
sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

Conclusion: RelMap通过显式建模空间和语义关系，显著提升了在线地图构建的效果。

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important
role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have
become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches
often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map
elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we
propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction
by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a
Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative
positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware
relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on
predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method
is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2
datasets.

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上的实验显示，LinDeps提升了压缩率并保持性能，在低资源设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: LinDeps是当前和未来剪枝技术的重要补充，显著提升了剪枝效果和推理速度。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision
tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges
for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network
pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational
requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant
parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally
removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning
techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,
resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,
a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top
of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant
filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted
QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent
filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's
kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any
fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet
backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing
pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the
art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no
retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and
inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore
constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接偏好优化（DPO）方法在处理幻觉问题时依赖静态监督信号，导致过拟合和虚假相关性，损害视觉信息的因果关联。

Method: 提出TARS方法，将DPO重新定义为最小-最大优化问题，通过最大化语义约束下的分布偏移模拟对齐不确定性，同时最小化偏好损失。

Result: TARS在多个幻觉基准测试中表现优异，仅需4.8k偏好样本，将幻觉率从26.4%降至13.2%，认知值从2.5降至0.4。

Conclusion: TARS有效减少幻觉问题，性能优于标准DPO，并在关键指标上与GPT-4o相当。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning,
yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually
ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference
optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by
aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies
typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on
static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to
superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional
rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant
visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a
token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max
optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under
semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously
minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.
This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to
preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.
We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently
strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,
TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition
value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on
several key metrics.

Conclusion: 本文为熟悉WSSS基础的研究者提供了当前进展和方法创新的深入理解，并指出了未来研究的多个方向。

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense
prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image
level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most
practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this
review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this
review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting
less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing
surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and
comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest
advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS
with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and
levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of
applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that
remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the
limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions
for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already
familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their
understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在身份保留、高保真图像生成和自然可控的老化过程三个方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更精细的控制和更真实的老化效果，优于现有技术。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of
current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing
techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a
reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age
heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic
elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to
selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach
provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process,
enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion
refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally
consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging:
robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a
natural, controllable aging progression.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有自监督方法，AUC分数提升显著（如GOT10K提升25.3%）。

Conclusion: SSTrack通过自监督学习有效减少对标注的依赖，为视觉跟踪提供了新范式。

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with
manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human
effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this
work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named
\textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.
Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is
proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global
spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the
simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn
instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust
instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm
enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a
self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.
Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker}
surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an
improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the
GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively. Code:

Result: DeepLabv3在实验条件下优于SAM2和MedSAM2，无需结构修改。

Conclusion: 在特定生物医学任务中，适当简化的模型可能比复杂模型更可靠，且开源实现支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness
under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully
configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions,
outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant
MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for
specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased
model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work
revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are
always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler
models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific
biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that
includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the
aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative
medicine and related fields.

Conclusion: 合成数据方法有效提升了模型性能，适用于风力涡轮机检测任务。

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades,
accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone
positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically
rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and
the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting,
turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to
generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and
environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging
learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network
solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and
their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both
using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising
performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose
mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

Conclusion: EMIT通过难度感知GRPO和多模态数据增强，有效提升了MLLMs在工业异常检测中的表现。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the
safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their
effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In
this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via
difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a
multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to
compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it
integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from
patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases
where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a
difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a
response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the
sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen
learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD
benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of
MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model
(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

*Qimin Wang,Xinda Liu,Guohua Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GuidPaint是一种无需训练的、基于分类器引导的图像修复框架，通过控制去噪过程实现语义一致性和视觉真实感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的多模态修复方法需要架构修改和重新训练，计算成本高；而上下文感知方法缺乏对掩码区域的精细控制，导致语义不一致。

Method: 提出GuidPaint，结合分类器引导和随机/确定性采样，精确控制掩码区域的生成。

Result: 实验表明，GuidPaint在质量和定量评估上优于现有上下文感知方法。

Conclusion: GuidPaint无需额外训练即可实现高质量的图像修复，具有语义一致性和视觉真实感。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image
inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving
impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion
models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in
high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting
methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising
steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and
significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained
control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or
visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a
training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating
classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise
control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both
semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic
and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate
results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate
that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware
inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

surveillance and public safety. With the advancement of deep learning, the
continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD
methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene
adaptability, thereby improving algorithm generalization and expanding
application boundaries. More importantly, the rapid development of multi-modal

LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data
annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The
surge in publications and the evolution of tasks have created an urgent need
for systematic reviews of recent advancements. This paper presents the first

LLM-based VAD methods, offering a thorough analysis of the new VAD paradigms
empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their
strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on
current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of
technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key
challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the
VAD community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对南极底栖生物监测的定制化目标检测框架，解决了海洋生态图像分析中的关键挑战，并在25种细粒度形态类型中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监测南极底栖生物多样性对理解气候变化驱动的生态变化至关重要，但传统手动标注方法效率低下，阻碍了大规模分析。

Method: 结合分辨率保持的分块、空间数据增强、微调和基于Slicing Aided Hyper Inference的后处理，构建了目标检测框架。

Result: 在检测中等和大型生物方面表现优异，但对小型和稀有类群的检测仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来机器辅助的底栖生物多样性监测研究提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding
ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is
typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though
manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding
large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for
identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution
towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for
benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key
challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited
annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The
proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data
augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate
strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25
fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area.
Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in
current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation
for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

*Sangmin Han,Jinho Jeong,Jinwoo Kim,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT框架通过统计匹配和尺度感知调度解决了基于补丁方法的分布偏移和单调性问题，提升了高分辨率图像生成的细节和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定分辨率的潜在扩散模型在高分辨率图像生成中存在局限性，而基于补丁的方法虽有效但存在分布偏移和单调性问题。

Method: 提出APT框架，结合统计匹配和尺度感知调度，优化补丁分布和去噪路径。

Result: APT生成了更清晰的高分辨率图像，同时实现了更快的采样速度。

Conclusion: APT为高分辨率图像生成提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to
high-resolution image generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分步框架，通过身份阻断和医学语义补偿解决医学图像去标识化问题，同时引入特征解耦策略以消除残留身份信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去标识化方法未能充分保留医学语义且缺乏隐私级别灵活性，需改进。

Method: 分步框架：1) 身份阻断以调整隐私级别；2) 医学语义补偿；3) 特征解耦策略消除残留身份信息。

Result: 在七个数据集和三个下游任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在隐私保护和医学语义保留方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its
re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive
evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three
downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 提出了一种新的评估框架，结合局部匹配稳定性和最远可匹配帧指标，分析现有增强技术的优缺点。

Result: 通过实验验证了视觉增强对SLAM算法性能的影响，证明了框架的实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 该框架为水下图像增强方法提供了鲁棒且上下文感知的评估标准，适用于实际水下场景。

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as
quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image
enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by
light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays
a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous
navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and
frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on
frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to
underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths
and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of
real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our
framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance
of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater
scenarios.

Motivation: 增强复杂模型（如检测Transformer）的可解释性和透明度，填补了理解内部组件作用的研究空白。

Method: 采用神经科学中的消融研究方法，系统地分析三种检测Transformer模型（DETR、DDETR、DINO）中关键组件（如查询嵌入、MHSA和MHCA层）的消融影响。

Result: 发现模型对消融的敏感性不同：DETR对编码器MHSA和解码器MHCA敏感，DDETR因多尺度可变形注意力更鲁棒，DINO因知识分布机制最鲁棒。同时揭示了结构冗余性。

Conclusion: 研究为检测Transformer的可解释AI提供了内部组件作用的清晰认识，为优化透明度和效率提供了方向。

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

TL;DR: 提出SAMITE模型，基于SAM2改进，通过原型记忆库和位置提示生成器解决目标遮挡和干扰问题，提升跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉目标跟踪方法在时间依赖性和泛化性上存在不足，且难以应对遮挡和干扰。

Method: 基于SAM2构建SAMITE模型，引入原型记忆库量化跟踪结果的正确性，并生成位置提示以减少干扰。

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: SAMITE有效解决了遮挡和干扰问题，提升了跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous
driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be
roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where
the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the
latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,
showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some
methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the
tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the
rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail
to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not
have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle
them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,
including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the
feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,
and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of
occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,
their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept
error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the
impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to
provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate
tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing
the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在视觉编码器和大型语言模型耦合中存在向量间隙和语义差异，导致信息丢失，亟需一种更有效的对齐机制。

Method: 提出MAGE框架，引入IAN实现维度和语义对齐，结合交叉熵和均方误差训练策略，并开发多模态工具调用指令数据集以增强模型能力。

Result: MAGE在多个评估基准（MME、MMBench、SEED）上表现优于同类工作。

Conclusion: MAGE通过创新的对齐机制和训练策略，显著提升了多模态学习的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the
spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical
challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is
positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large
language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or
semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation
process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and
Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of
vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the
Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic
alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a
training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error,
significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's
"Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal
tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries.
Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved
significantly better performance compared to similar works across various
evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and
appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

TL;DR: AdvRF提出了一种对抗性重建反馈框架，用于学习类别无关的差异表示，解决了现有细粒度图像检索方法对预定义类别的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度图像检索方法依赖于预定义类别的监督，导致检索表示中引入了类别特定的语义，限制了其对未见类别的泛化能力。

Method: AdvRF通过结合检索模型的类别感知差异定位和重建模型的类别无关特征学习，将细粒度图像检索重新定义为视觉差异重建任务。

Result: AdvRF在细粒度和粗粒度数据集上均表现出色。

Conclusion: AdvRF通过学习类别无关的差异表示，显著提升了细粒度图像检索的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on
supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations
for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce
category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating
semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder
generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel
adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning
category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates
FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware
discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature
learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual
discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve
localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide
the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,
the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction
model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This
representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge
distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used
fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感等专业领域因标注数据稀缺而难以应用大型语言和视觉语言模型的问题。

Method: 采用策略梯度优化，仅需一个示例即可对齐模型输出，适用于分类、视觉问答等任务。

Result: 实验表明，即使一个示例也能显著提升性能，128个示例可媲美数千标注样本训练的模型。

Conclusion: RLVR为数据稀缺领域提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled
strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized
domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We
present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)
framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption
supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based
rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to
vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as
one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including
classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a
single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to
128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated
samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific
overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and
efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss
weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our
method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of
domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe
for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of
reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶员疲劳是交通事故的主要原因，现有深度学习模型计算量大，不适合资源有限的嵌入式设备。

Method: 将视频数据转换为时空图（STG），使用MobileNet提取面部特征，并通过轻量级时空图神经网络检测疲劳。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，显著降低计算复杂度和延迟。

Conclusion: LiteFat为嵌入式设备提供了实时、高效的疲劳检测解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems
that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准ViT存在参数冗余和计算成本高的问题，限制了实际部署。现有方法多为静态压缩或固定计算深度，无法灵活分配资源。

Method: 引入Mixture-of-Recursions（MoR）范式，实现token级动态递归机制，使每个token能自适应确定处理深度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和迁移基准测试中，MoR-ViT实现了70%参数减少和2.5倍推理加速，同时精度优于DynamicViT和TinyViT。

Conclusion: 动态递归是高效视觉Transformer的有效策略，为可扩展和可部署的深度学习模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image
recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial
parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical
deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static
model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by
fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a
novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a
token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions
(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its
processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of
computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer
benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also
outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT
under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an
effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for
scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: AU-LLM展示了LLM在微表情分析中的显著潜力和鲁棒性，为未来研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable
challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary
human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound
reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity
domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers
this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the
first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle
intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical
vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The
EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level
(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a
specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an
efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often
struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to
overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore,
recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex
architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance
few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture
diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic
guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions
automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a
diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and
orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant
representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that
MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,
achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp
baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain
generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at:

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了医学图像-文本预训练的效果，增强了临床语义的捕捉能力。

Abstract: Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with
clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream
tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and
ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced
clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware
medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities
in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest
X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large
language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context.
These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the
`appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally
`observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical
semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework
captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved
representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates
significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining
state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: HunyuanWorld 1.0为3D世界生成提供了高效、交互性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world
generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods
that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and
3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited
training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these
limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the
best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D
scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key
advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and
interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality,
physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.

Conclusion: 论文强调了开发上下文感知防御的紧迫性，以应对这些易于实施的越狱策略。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large
language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to
prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial
examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort,
high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded
prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts
reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn
narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional
impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of
prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,
grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals
that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output
validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by
highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease
with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.

Motivation: 现有方法复杂且效率低，需要一种更简单高效的跨架构知识蒸馏方法。

Method: 提出冗余抑制蒸馏（RSD）损失，结合跨架构不变性最大化和特征去相关目标，并设计轻量模块保护学生模型的架构特定能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k上优于OFA方法，参数开销更少。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，有望成为跨架构知识蒸馏的强基线。

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation,
where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression
formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules,
architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their
efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic
knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant
architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy
suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture
invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the
student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further
design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's
internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific
designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms
OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their
parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong
baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种选择性跨模态融合框架（SMFNet），用于RGB-D视频显著目标检测（VSOD），通过像素级选择性融合策略（PSF）和多维选择性注意力模块（MSAM）优化运动与深度信息的利用。

Motivation: 现有RGB-D VSOD模型对运动和深度信息的利用不足，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出SMFNet框架，包含PSF策略和MSAM模块，选择性融合光学流和深度信息，并与RGB模态结合。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了SMFNet的优越性，建立了最全面的RGB-D VSOD基准。

Conclusion: SMFNet通过选择性融合和注意力机制显著提升了RGB-D VSOD的性能。

Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task
called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to
considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D
videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models
have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion
information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and
promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to
effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.
Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to
model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in
individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address
this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel
selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a
pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of
optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose
a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused
features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple
dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined
features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19
state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation
the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also
demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation
on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the
efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly
available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在时间不一致性和提示过拟合问题，且计算资源需求高。

Method: 提出Vid-TTA框架，结合运动感知帧重建和提示扰动策略，通过元学习动态平衡损失。

Result: 实验表明Vid-TTA显著提升时间一致性，减少过拟合，且计算开销低。

Conclusion: Vid-TTA为现有视频编辑模型提供即插即用的性能提升。

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw
footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative
objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal
inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and
overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone
architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they
typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a
lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for
each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our
approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that
identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt
perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to
diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a
meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts
the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and
mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead,
offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

Method: 提出双模型框架，分别学习头部到指尖和手腕到指尖的指向方向，引入高斯射线热图表示和CLIP感知集成模块，并添加对象中心预测辅助任务。

Result: 在YouRefIt数据集上，0.25 IoU阈值下性能提升了约4 mAP。

Conclusion: 双模型框架和多模态集成显著提升了指向对象识别的准确性。

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves
predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both
pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires
multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,
and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively
leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the
referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally
aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a
single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one
model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the
wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap
representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong
supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.
To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing
Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.
Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task
to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through
extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving
an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

Conclusion: 该集成框架为快速创意原型设计和沉浸式叙事体验提供了强大平台。

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal
narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual
pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic
scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven
by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a
large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while
the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to
build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring
spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent
narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the
high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency,
further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent
emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on
a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate
that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and
emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated
framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and
immersive storytelling experiences.

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant

their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing

state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image

race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation
strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that
White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC:
0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis
revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only
visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic,
contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal
framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on
image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or
Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key
components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late
interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for
predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning
strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question
answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is
WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to
support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1
improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in
captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret
visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even
for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to
other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI
research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available

Conclusion: SwinECAT在9类眼底疾病分类中表现最佳，为当前公开数据集上的最高性能。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

Result: InternVL2.5-8B-RR模型在多个基准测试中平均提升2.7%，在Dyn-VQA上提升8.8%。

Conclusion: MMAT-1M有效提升了多模态推理和工具使用能力，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool
utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models.
However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent
tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language
models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale
multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and
dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data
engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing
question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for
the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;
3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical
consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both
Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally
compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)
format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe
significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model
achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%
on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in
enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/VIS-MPU-Agent/MMAT-1M.

*Xin Wang,Peng-Jie Li,Yuan-Yuan Shen*

TL;DR: LMAC-Net提出了一种多模态注意力一致性网络，用于长期动作质量评估，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效建模多模态线索（如音乐）或捕捉跨模态复杂交互，导致长期序列中关键性能变化跟踪不准确。

Method: LMAC-Net通过多模态注意力一致性机制对齐多模态特征，结合视觉和音频信息，并引入局部查询编码模块和两级评分评估。

Result: 在RG和Fis-V数据集上，LMAC-Net显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMAC-Net通过多模态对齐和特征增强，有效解决了长期动作质量评估的挑战。

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality
of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an
important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic
gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and
temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance
assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories:
unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate
for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that
typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep
cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to
capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track
critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these
challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network
(LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to
explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and
audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics
and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for
interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses
are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.
Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net
significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于mixup-class prompt的数据自由量化方法，通过融合多类别标签生成多样化合成数据，提升了量化模型的泛化能力和优化稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据自由量化方法在生成合成图像时，由于单类别提示的局限性（如多义性），导致量化模型性能下降。

Method: 提出mixup-class prompt策略，融合多类别标签生成合成数据，并通过梯度范数和泛化误差分析提供定量支持。

Result: 在CNN和ViT上实验表明，该方法优于现有DFQ方法（如GenQ），并在极低位量化（W2A4）中达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: mixup-class prompt策略有效解决了合成数据多样性不足的问题，显著提升了量化模型的性能。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with
limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation
(W2A4) quantization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需阴影掩码的自适应门控双分支注意力机制（AGBA）和基于扩散的频率-对比融合网络（FCFN），用于阴影去除，在复杂场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阴影去除方法依赖阴影掩码，但在真实场景中难以获取。探索局部对比信息等内在图像线索成为替代方案，但其在复杂场景中易受干扰。

Method: 提出AGBA机制动态过滤和重加权对比先验，分离阴影特征；引入FCFN网络，利用高频和对比线索指导生成过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无掩码方法中达到最优，且性能接近基于掩码的方法。

Conclusion: AGBA和FCFN的组合有效解决了阴影去除中的复杂场景问题，为无掩码方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free
approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素级标签稀缺，尤其在工业烟雾等领域标注困难，现有弱监督方法存在前景覆盖不全、边界不准确和虚假相关性等问题。

Method: 采用师生框架结合CNN和ViT，引入知识转移损失以对齐内部表示，并通过后处理技术提升伪掩码质量。

Result: 新框架直接针对共现问题，无需外部监督，提高了分割的准确性和覆盖范围。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了弱监督语义分割中的共现问题，提升了在工业烟雾等领域的性能。

Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical
scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed
annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To
alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in
models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from
limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object
boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where
emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge
to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address
the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we
propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem
without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a
single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and
ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture
consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate
post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve
pseudo mask quality.

TL;DR: PanoSplatt3R是一种无需姿态信息的宽基线全景重建方法，通过领域迁移和RoPE滚动技术，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖精确的姿态信息，但实际场景中姿态获取成本高且易受噪声影响，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 将重建预训练从透视域扩展到全景域，引入RoPE滚动技术以建模全景图像的水平周期性。

Result: PanoSplatt3R在无姿态信息下，显著优于现有方法，生成高质量新视图和精确深度估计。

Conclusion: PanoSplatt3R展示了在实用场景中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and
pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the
surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive
novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across
various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose
information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often
requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.
These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such
methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline
panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational
reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic
domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a
seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that
spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different
attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while
modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose
information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This
superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and
the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for
practical applications. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/PanoSplatt3R

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度学习框架，用于将心电图（ECG）图像分类为五种主要诊断类别，解决了图像噪声和波形细节检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病（CVDs）是全球主要死因，早期检测至关重要。ECG图像在临床中广泛使用，但自动分类仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用预处理管道减少噪声，并使用两阶段微调策略：先在合成和外部数据集上微调，再在目标数据集上优化。模型基于ConvNeXt架构。

Result: 在公开验证集和私有测试集上分别获得AUROC分数0.9688和0.9677，表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床工作流程中的自动化ECG解释提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and
early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.
These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area
has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent
deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most
ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge
this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to
classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method
was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science
Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual
noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform
patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a
two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and
external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further
fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We
adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method
achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the
private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,
highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation
in clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和精细时间分辨率，但在挑战性环境中实现稳健的场景理解仍面临事件流稀疏、噪声以及与图像数据融合的困难。

Method: 提出EIFNet，包含自适应事件特征细化模块（AEFRM）、模态自适应重校准模块（MARM）和多头注意力门控融合模块（MGFM），通过多尺度活动建模和空间注意力优化事件特征，并利用注意力机制和门控策略实现跨模态特征对齐与融合。

Result: 在DDD17-Semantic和DSEC-Semantic数据集上，EIFNet实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EIFNet有效解决了事件流稀疏性和噪声问题，提升了事件语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras,
which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust
scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the
task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features
from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense,
semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To
address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that
combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network
includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves
event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial
attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module
(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and
integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated
fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets
show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有微动作识别方法忽视了微动作中的细微变化，导致识别准确性受限。

Conclusion: 显式建模细微运动线索对微动作识别至关重要。

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in
social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis.
However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the
inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs
with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided
Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion
cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we
introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion
cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial
representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal
Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level,
facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions.
Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the
motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification.
Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate
that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action
recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion
cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在生成符合攻击者意图的内容时效率低且计算成本高，ZIUM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出ZIUM方法，支持零样本对抗攻击，无需额外优化即可针对未学习概念生成攻击内容。

Result: ZIUM在多种未学习场景中表现优异，攻击成功率高且显著减少攻击时间。

Conclusion: ZIUM为对抗攻击提供了一种高效且意图感知的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep
learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation.
Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing
removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing
adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that
aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to
identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a
Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables
the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's
intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without
requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The
evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in
successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a
superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its
zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for
previously attacked unlearned concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护计算机视觉模型的知识产权，防止未经授权的使用。

Method: 通过直接修改少量模型权重实现染色和锁定，锁定模型需在输入图像中插入触发补丁解锁。

Result: 实验证明方法有效且对模型性能影响最小。

Conclusion: 新方法为模型知识产权保护提供了实用且可证明的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to
protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as
watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

Method: 提出CEDANet框架，结合公民投票优化伪标签，并使用类特定域判别器进行特征对齐。

Result: 在SMOKE5K和IJmond数据集上，F1-score和IoU分别提升5倍和6倍，接近全监督模型性能。

Conclusion: 结合公民科学与弱监督域适应，为数据稀缺的环境监测提供了可扩展且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature
alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained
segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain
discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉理解和多模态推理方面表现出色，但常出现幻觉现象，即生成的文本与视觉内容不一致。现有方法多为文本中心，视觉语义对齐的挑战限制了其效果。

Method: ViHallu通过生成视觉变化图像（保持整体结构但可控变化）和构建视觉指令，增强LVLMs对细粒度视觉内容的理解，从而改善视觉语义对齐。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ViHallu显著提升了模型的细粒度视觉理解能力，并有效减少了幻觉倾向。

Conclusion: ViHallu框架通过视觉中心的方法有效缓解了LVLMs的幻觉问题，并发布了专门用于幻觉缓解和视觉语义对齐的ViHallu-Instruction数据集。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs
frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated
textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual
content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly
text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit
their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual
understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a
Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic
alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction
Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with
controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure.
These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable
LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning,
allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual
content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances
models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing
hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual
instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and
visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at

Motivation: 探讨密集AV模型在低资源、多语言和噪声环境中的表现，验证其是否适用于发展中国家典型的多语言混杂场景。

Method: 使用多语言数据集Project Vaani，对比三种对比目标函数：全局均值池化（CLIP风格）、密集最大-均值标记匹配（DenseAV风格）和简单混合方法。

Result: 密集目标函数在音频-视觉检索中相对全局池化提升了59%的R@1，并显著降低了平均和中位数排名，同时生成清晰的零样本定位热图。

Conclusion: 密集标记路由不仅适用于高资源英语语料库，在低资源多语言环境中表现更为关键，尤其是在标注和音频质量较低的情况下。

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and
emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric,
caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in
low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify
developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation
function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project
Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare
three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii)
a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid
(motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers
a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and
substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp
zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision
backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results
demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English
corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are
scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

Result: 实验表明S2E缓解了仅依赖离线数据的收益递减问题，强化学习在机器人学习中优于监督微调。

Conclusion: 整合交互式在线经验对扩展机器人基础模型至关重要。

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents
to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these
models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about
the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual
understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban
navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and
moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the
Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation
foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of
pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the
generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing
its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we
introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,
which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through
anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains
reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's
pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end
evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions
of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can
systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation
models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns
often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis
of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in
the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the
crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale
foundation models in Robotics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了浅层网络（如ConvNet-4）在细粒度少样本学习（FGFSL）中的潜力，并提出了一种新的位置感知星座网络（LCN-4），通过创新的位置编码和特征聚类模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究浅层网络在FGFSL中的表现，验证其是否能够达到或超越主流深度网络的性能。

Method: 提出LCN-4网络，包含位置感知特征聚类模块、网格位置编码补偿和频域位置嵌入技术。

Result: LCN-4在三个细粒度少样本基准测试中表现优异，超越ConvNet-4，并与ResNet12方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 浅层网络通过优化设计可以在FGFSL中实现高性能，验证了研究假设。

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum
of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily
depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as
ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger
quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially
re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully
encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture
could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep
backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a
location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge
location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder
and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature
location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we
innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to
effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the
feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we
further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to
offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out
validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.
Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the
ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with
or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our
conjecture.

Result: 在密集3D重建和开放词汇3D分割任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Ov3R框架为实时、语义感知的空间AI迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: We present Ov3R, a novel framework for open-vocabulary semantic 3D
reconstruction from RGB video streams, designed to advance Spatial AI. The
system features two key components: CLIP3R, a CLIP-informed 3D reconstruction
module that predicts dense point maps from overlapping clips while embedding
object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module
that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating
spatial, geometric, and semantic cues. Unlike prior methods, Ov3R incorporates
CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally
consistent geometry and fine-grained semantic alignment. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both dense 3D reconstruction and
open-vocabulary 3D segmentation, marking a step forward toward real-time,
semantics-aware Spatial AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小样本图像识别与传统大规模图像识别之间的技术差距，提升识别效率和准确性。

Method: MetaLab由LabNet和LabGNN两个协同神经网络组成，分别用于CIELab颜色空间转换和特征提取，以及轻量图和颜色图之间的相互学习。

Conclusion: MetaLab在小样本图像识别中表现出色，具有高精度、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects,
yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale
image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method
for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning
(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural
networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color
space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can
facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For
sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on
four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four
cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high
accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with
one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our
MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human
recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合强化学习的自回归模型X-Omni，解决了图像生成中的视觉保真度低和指令遵循问题，实现了图像与语言生成的无缝集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自回归模型在图像生成中存在视觉保真度低、输出扭曲及复杂指令遵循困难的问题，主要源于自回归推理中的累积误差或离散化过程中的信息丢失。

Method: 提出X-Omni框架，包括语义图像分词器、统一的自回归模型（用于语言和图像）和离线扩散解码器，结合强化学习提升生成质量。

Result: X-Omni在图像生成任务中表现优异，使用7B语言模型生成高质量图像，同时具备强大的指令遵循和长文本渲染能力。

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效提升离散自回归模型的生成质量，X-Omni为图像与语言生成提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction''
paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image
generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through
autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such
as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex
instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely
attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information
loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this
challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training
image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with
autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate
artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete
autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image
and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a
unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline
diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language
model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong
capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StepAL是一种针对手术视频步骤识别的主动学习框架，通过整合步骤感知特征表示和熵加权聚类策略，显著减少标注成本并提高识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在手术视频分析中效果不佳，因为它们无法捕捉长视频中的步骤依赖关系，且标注需依赖完整视频上下文。

Method: StepAL结合步骤感知特征表示（利用伪标签）和熵加权聚类策略，优先选择不确定且步骤多样的视频进行标注。

Result: 在Cataract-1k和Cataract-101数据集上，StepAL优于现有方法，以更少的标注视频实现更高的步骤识别准确率。

Conclusion: StepAL为手术视频分析提供了一种高效的主动学习方法，降低了开发计算机辅助手术系统的标注负担。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis
while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed
for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition
due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These
methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is
ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the
entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active
learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step
recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which
leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within
each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination
prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step
compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets
(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms
existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step
recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for
efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing
computer-assisted surgical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FSVOS方法主要关注静态对象类别，忽略了视频中的动态运动模式，限制了其在需要运动理解场景中的应用。

Method: 论文提出了Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA)作为基线方法，并在MOVE数据集上评估了6种现有方法。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在运动引导FSVOS任务中表现不佳，而DMA方法在少样本运动理解中表现优越。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了运动引导FSVOS的空白，为未来研究提供了基础和方向。

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS),
which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated
examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods
typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore
the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios
requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on
MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different
related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current
methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the
associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion
Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid
foundation for future research in this direction.

TL;DR: MetaCLIP 2提出了一种从全球网络数据训练CLIP的方法，解决了多语言数据处理的挑战，并在多语言基准测试中取得了新的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP模型在多语言数据训练中的挑战，包括数据点处理和多语言性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出MetaCLIP 2，通过最小化必要的调整，从全球网络数据训练CLIP，实现英语和非英语数据的互利。

Result: 在零样本ImageNet分类中超越英语专用模型，并在多语言基准测试中创下新记录。

Conclusion: MetaCLIP 2为多语言CLIP训练提供了一种有效方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual
benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with
64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Symbiotic Epistemology的哲学框架，将AI视为推理伙伴而非工具，并通过SynLang协议实现透明协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的不透明性阻碍了人类监督和协作潜力，传统可解释AI方法无法实现真正的共生协作。

Method: 引入Symbiotic Epistemology哲学框架和SynLang协议，包括TRACE和TRACE_FE机制，支持透明推理和信心量化。

Result: 通过实际人机对话验证，AI能适应结构化推理协议并成功干预元认知。

Conclusion: SynLang和共生认识论通过双层次透明性，增强人类智能并维护伦理责任。

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human
oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches
offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic
collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a
philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks
that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions
AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human
confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and
confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as
a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is
empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's
adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive
intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for
high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It
also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI
behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring
communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,
together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human
intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in
collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with
high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the
protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of
AI decision-making.

Motivation: 通过LLMs辅助开发Synthea模块，旨在提高效率、降低门槛并改善合成数据的质量。

Method: 提出四种LLMs支持方式：生成疾病档案、从档案生成模块、评估现有模块及优化模块，并引入渐进式优化概念。

Result: LLMs在模块开发中展现出潜力，但也存在需人工监督、严格测试及验证等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究以充分发挥LLMs在合成数据生成中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the
development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health
data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the
potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model
diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We
demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating
a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,
evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We
introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively
evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and
clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While
the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the
challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the
importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for
inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations
for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided
synthetic data creation.

Result: 发现不同LLMs具有独特且一致的认知剖面，受模型规模和文本复杂度影响。

Conclusion: 提供了一种新的、原则性的方法，用于分析和比较AI的内在操作动态。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now
extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This
paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure
\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how}
they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe
these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given
model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a
visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty
changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several
state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent
cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.
We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the
desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled
lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of
artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: NPO是一个对齐感知学习框架，通过结构化反馈实现人机协同决策系统的动态对齐优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法中将对齐视为静态或事后属性的问题，提出可测量、可监督和可减少的对齐损失。

Method: 引入对齐损失的形式化定义，提出元对齐概念，并通过场景评分、阈值调整、策略验证和反馈收集实现可扩展操作循环。

Result: 在随机反馈下证明了对齐损失和监控保真度的收敛性，并在大规模部署中展示了实际价值。

Conclusion: NPO为持续对齐监控提供了紧凑且可检查的架构，将理论对齐保证与动态环境中的实际可靠性联系起来。

Abstract: We present NPO, an alignment-aware learning framework that operationalizes
feedback-driven adaptation in human-in-the-loop decision systems. Unlike prior
approaches that treat alignment as a static or post-hoc property, NPO
introduces a formalization of alignment loss that is measurable, supervisable,
and reducible under structured feedback. In parallel, we propose meta-alignment
as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override
triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via
threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop
involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured
feedback ingestion, including "likes", overrides, and abstentions. We provide
formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both
alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO
demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A
simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the
theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable
architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical
alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高风险决策中被广泛使用，但缺乏标准保障措施，可能导致误导性建议，因此需要研究其失败模式和改进方法。

Method: 通过三个实验：(1) 多选评估模型对用户压力的稳定性；(2) 自由回答分析，使用新的安全分类法和LLM法官；(3) 机制可解释性实验，通过操纵“高风险”激活向量调整模型行为。

Result: 部分模型表现出奉承行为，但如o4-mini等模型表现稳健；表现最佳的模型通过频繁提问而非直接建议实现高安全评分；激活导向可控制模型的谨慎性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要多方面的基准测试以确保LLMs在高风险决策中的可信度，并提出激活导向为安全对齐的新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life
advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but
misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This
paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a
multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure;
(2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge;
and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by
manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while
some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust.
Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking
clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather
than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's
cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a
new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced,
multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing
decisions.

Abstract: In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku
difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods
that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to
characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a
Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first
proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures
the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given
digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku
solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking
algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number
of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a
randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand
Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty
level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics
and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a
universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the
two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both
individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku
websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and
Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku
websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,
the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty
levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku
practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的发展，理解和可靠地抑制其有害行为的需求日益迫切。

Method: 引入多维框架，学习55个有害子概念的线性探针，构建有害子空间，并通过主导方向引导和消融测试。

Result: 发现有害子空间低秩，主导方向引导可几乎消除有害性且对实用性影响较小。

Conclusion: 概念子空间为理解大型语言模型行为提供了可扩展的视角，并为社区提供了审核和强化未来语言模型的实用工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to
understand and reliably curb their harmful behaviours. We introduce a
multidimensional framework for probing and steering harmful content in model
internals. For each of 55 distinct harmfulness subconcepts (e.g., racial hate,
employment scams, weapons), we learn a linear probe, yielding 55 interpretable
directions in activation space. Collectively, these directions span a
harmfulness subspace that we show is strikingly low-rank. We then test ablation
of the entire subspace from model internals, as well as steering and ablation
in the subspace's dominant direction. We find that dominant direction steering
allows for near elimination of harmfulness with a low decrease in utility. Our
findings advance the emerging view that concept subspaces provide a scalable
lens on LLM behaviour and offer practical tools for the community to audit and
harden future generations of language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应可解释AI框架（AXTF），通过实时监测用户的认知和情绪状态，动态调整解释内容，以在高压力环境中快速建立人机信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高压力场景（如应急响应）中，现有XAI方法提供的统一解释和显式反馈机制不实用，无法有效促进人机信任。

Method: 利用EEG、ECG和眼动追踪等生理和行为信号推断用户状态，通过多目标个性化信任估计模型动态调整解释内容。

Result: AXTF框架为高压力、时间敏感环境中开发自适应、非侵入式XAI系统奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 自适应XAI框架AXTF通过实时响应用户状态，显著提升了高压力场景中人机协作的快速信任。

Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in
high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate
decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding
settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between
human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI)
approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit
feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure
scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive
XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive
and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust
in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust
framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG,
ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation.
At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps
workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide
the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized
support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual
framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI
systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应集群协作方法，通过自多样性和交叉一致性最大化机制提升LLMs在医疗决策支持中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs协作缺乏明确的组件选择规则，且部分LLMs在医疗场景中表现不佳，限制了其协作效果。

Method: 采用自多样性（计算LLM内部输出的模糊匹配值）和交叉一致性（逐步剔除一致性低的LLM）机制优化LLM集群。

Result: 在NEJMQA和MMLU-Pro-health数据集上表现优异，例如在NEJMQA的妇产科领域准确率达65.47%，优于GPT-4的56.12%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLMs在医疗决策支持中的协作效果，尤其在专业领域表现突出。

Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in
natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for
healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,
necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,
existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial
LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the
collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster
collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency
maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For
the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs
within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with
high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For
the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the
LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask
out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the
potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive
experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented
specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up
to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially
achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the
Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的自动化建模与优化方法，用于解决分布式能源资源在主动配电网（ADN）中的调度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式能源资源在ADN中的渗透率增加，缺乏专业知识的运营商依赖专家既昂贵又耗时，亟需智能、灵活的调度解决方案。

Method: 将ADN调度问题分解为多个阶段，设计了一个多LLM协作架构，包括信息提取器、问题构建器和代码编程器，并针对每个LLM代理开发了优化技术。

Result: 通过用户友好的自然语言查询界面生成调度策略，显著提高了准确性和可靠性，并在多种测试案例中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功降低了技术门槛，提高了调度效率，为ADN运营商提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active
distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative.
However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution
system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack
specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and
programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly
and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible
ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered
automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems
are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination
architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a
Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,
optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.
Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The
proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators
to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating
technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and
end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of
the proposed architecture and methods.

to obtain an overall analysis of risk, making explicit what are the sufficient
conditions for being a risk. Plausible necessary conditions are also mentioned

Result: 在三个数据集、六个大语言模型和五种偏见类型上的实验表明，该框架在揭示复杂偏见模式方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架具有更强的能力和可扩展性，能有效识别医学大语言模型中的偏见。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are used in medical applications are known
to show biased and unfair patterns. Prior to adopting these in clinical
decision-making applications, it is crucial to identify these bias patterns to
enable effective mitigation of their impact. In this study, we present a novel
framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary LLMs to
systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. Specifically, the
proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation techniques to identify
subtle bias patterns. The approach adopts a customized multi-hop
characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.
Through a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and
five bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater
ability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to
other baselines.

Conclusion: 讨论了Agentic Web的潜在应用、社会风险和治理问题，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a
pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by
autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact
directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on
behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine
interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital
operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this
paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the
Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and
identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to
our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:
intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable
the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and
collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges
involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication
protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent
Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,
societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline
research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems
shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously

TL;DR: 该论文提出一个基准测试，评估大语言模型（LLMs）在解释复杂问题时的组合能力，发现其性能随问题复杂度增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在语言解释过程中是否具有系统性组合能力，尤其是将复杂问题映射为SPARQL查询的能力。

Method: 生成三个基于DBpedia图模式的数据集，使用Lemon词汇进行语言化，通过不同提示和优化技术（如few-shot和微调）测试LLMs。

Result: 实验显示，随着问题复杂度增加，LLMs的宏F1分数从0.45降至0.09，即使提供所有必要信息，最高F1分数仅为0.57。

Conclusion: LLMs在系统性和组合性解释复杂问题并映射为SPARQL查询方面存在困难。

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

Motivation: 现有方法将LLM的推理和训练任务分离部署，导致资源浪费和延迟适应新数据。

Method: LeMix整合离线分析、执行预测和运行时调度，动态分配资源。

Result: LeMix提升吞吐量3.53倍，减少推理损失0.61倍，响应时间SLO达成率提高2.12倍。

Conclusion: LeMix首次实现LLM推理与训练的联合优化，为高效部署LLM提供新思路。

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

Method: 构建了一个端到端系统，包括查询分类器和微调LLM，用于检测模糊查询并生成澄清问题。

Result: 微调LLM在生成有用澄清问题上优于零样本提示，用户研究显示其生成的代码更准确和有用。

Conclusion: 该编码助手通过模仿人类代码审查过程，显著提高了代码生成的质量和用户满意度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding assistants.
However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code
generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive
prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based
coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking
clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
  Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect
unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates
clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM
outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification
questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the
clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline,
demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code
responses compared to baseline coding assistants.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in
reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and
knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance
assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation,
balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling
of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring
system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing
embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with
mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics,
a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for
queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved
transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of
more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in
dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in
accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency
with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM
reliability.

Conclusion: Trans-ACT为冲突解决、教育支持和高级社会心理学研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social
interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive
complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT
(Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional
Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic
psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego
states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves
context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations.
The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the
agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario,
demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper
and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for
a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support,

Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to
understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data
annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation
task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public
disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with
heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment
conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the
tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an
"interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool
interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information
if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool
accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy,
particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to
the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the
human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill,
not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in
both the accuracy and speed of task performance.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了现有方法的空白，为动态高效的供应链管理提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand
fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability
due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving
averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine
learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer
potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training
inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,
inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to
their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making
them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their
success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their
potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study
introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in
multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and
XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the
bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates
how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual
demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a
critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for
dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

*Tenghao Huang,Sihao Chen,Muhao Chen,Jonathan May,Longqi Yang,Mengting Wan,Pei Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新任务范式：主动信息收集，通过强化微调策略训练LLMs在模糊任务中主动提问以填补信息空白。实验显示模型在自动和人工评估中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在模糊任务中表现被动，无法主动收集关键信息，限制了其作为协作伙伴的能力。

Method: 设计了部分指定的任务框架，采用强化微调策略奖励模型提出能获取隐含信息的问题。

Result: Qwen-2.5-7B模型在自动评估中优于基线18%，人工评估中其提问和最终方案分别被偏好42%和28%。

Conclusion: 主动信息收集显著提升了LLMs的协作能力，使其从被动文本生成器转变为真正的协作伙伴。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

### [119] [Shapley Uncertainty in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21406)
*Meilin Zhu,Gaojie Jin,Xiaowei Huang,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley的语义不确定性度量方法，优于传统的基于阈值的语义熵方法，能更准确地预测大语言模型在问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在问答任务中，确定何时信任大语言模型的输出是关键问题。现有的语义熵方法依赖阈值设定，无法充分捕捉语义关系的连续性。

Method: 提出了一种基于Shapley的语义不确定性度量框架，满足三个基本性质，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，Shapley不确定性在问答和其他数据集上比基线方法更准确地预测模型性能。

Conclusion: Shapley不确定性是一种更优的语义不确定性度量方法，适用于大语言模型的输出可信度评估。

Abstract: In question-answering tasks, determining when to trust the outputs is crucial
to the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Kuhn et al. (2023) introduces
semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty, by incorporating linguistic
invariances from the same meaning. It primarily relies on setting threshold to
measure the level of semantic equivalence relation. We propose a more nuanced
framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based
uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic
relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize
valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies
these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley
uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and
other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures.

Result: 总结了图在LLM代理中的关键作用，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文为GLA研究提供了路线图，强调了图在LLM代理系统中的重要性。

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web
navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are
limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term
memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a
powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination
in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of
research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and
comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions
for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their
primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool
usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to
each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate
the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.
Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from
improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal
GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on
GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent
systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对政府领域LLM的评估主要关注特定场景的安全性，而对其核心能力（如领域相关性）的评估不足。

Method: 开发了GovRelBench基准，包含政府领域提示和专用评估工具GovRelBERT，采用SoftGovScore方法训练模型。

Result: 提出了一个增强的大模型能力评估框架，为相关研究和实践提供了有效工具。

Conclusion: GovRelBench填补了政府领域LLM核心能力评估的空白，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Current evaluations of LLMs in the government domain primarily focus on
safety considerations in specific scenarios, while the assessment of the
models' own core capabilities, particularly domain relevance, remains
insufficient. To address this gap, we propose GovRelBench, a benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating the core capabilities of LLMs in the
government domain. GovRelBench consists of government domain prompts and a
dedicated evaluation tool, GovRelBERT. During the training process of
GovRelBERT, we introduce the SoftGovScore method: this method trains a model
based on the ModernBERT architecture by converting hard labels to soft scores,
enabling it to accurately compute the text's government domain relevance score.
This work aims to enhance the capability evaluation framework for large models
in the government domain, providing an effective tool for relevant research and
practice. Our code and dataset are available at

### [122] [Evo-DKD: Dual-Knowledge Decoding for Autonomous Ontology Evolution in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21438)
*Vishal Raman,Vijai Aravindh R*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evo-DKD是一个双解码器框架，结合结构化本体遍历和非结构化文本推理，用于自主本体演化，优于仅使用结构化或非结构化解码的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动维护本体和知识图谱耗时费力，而大型语言模型（LLMs）虽具备丰富非结构化知识，但难以保持结构化一致性。

Method: Evo-DKD采用双解码器框架，一个生成本体编辑候选，另一个生成自然语言解释，并通过动态注意力门控机制协调两者。

Result: 实验表明，Evo-DKD在本体更新精度和下游任务性能上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Evo-DKD为LLM驱动的知识库维护提供了新范式，结合了符号和神经推理的优势。

Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Sherpa Rx在药物基因组学中的性能，并探索其在实际应用中的潜力。

Method: 研究分为两个阶段：第一阶段仅嵌入CPIC数据，第二阶段加入PharmGKB内容。通过260个查询评估工具，使用5点Likert量表评分，并与ChatGPT-4omini对比。

Result: Sherpa Rx在准确性、相关性、清晰度和完整性上表现优异（得分4.9-5.0），召回率达0.99。第二阶段在部分指标上优于第一阶段，且显著优于ChatGPT-4omini。

Conclusion: 结合CPIC和PharmGKB的RAG技术显著提升了AI在药物基因组学中的性能，展示了生成式AI在个性化医疗中的潜力。

Abstract: This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging
large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa
Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate
contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC
guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations,
and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2
additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy,
relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between
Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world
applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated
high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8,
and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy
(4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8).
ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but
lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2
significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx
achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional
resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance.
This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa
Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized
responses.

### [124] [An LLM Driven Agent Framework for Automated Infrared Spectral Multi Task Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21471)
*Zujie Xie,Zixuan Chen,Jiheng Liang,Xiangyang Yu,Ziru Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的端到端框架，用于在低数据条件下实现红外光谱的自动分析，其性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外光谱分析面临高维度和重叠谱带的挑战，传统方法难以应对，而大语言模型的泛化和推理能力为自动化复杂科学流程提供了新思路。

Method: 通过整合文献知识库、自动光谱预处理、特征提取和多任务推理，构建了一个LLM驱动的代理框架，并采用闭环多轮协议动态优化预测。

Result: 在多种材料数据集上，多轮LLM推理的性能优于单轮推理，并在低数据条件下与机器学习和深度学习模型相当或更优。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的框架为低数据条件下的红外光谱分析提供了高效且准确的解决方案，展现了其在科学自动化中的潜力。

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical
and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral
bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large
language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning,
offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite
this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely
unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate,
automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an
LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven
agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base,
automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning
in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR
publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected
methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are
fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly
detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted
samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across
diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri
Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM
consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine
learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能准确模拟个体决策的AI，以促进人类与AI的协作与理解，国际象棋作为测试平台。

Method: 两阶段优化：1) 通过原型丰富模型连接群体与个体行为建模；2) 利用能力水平或用户原型初始化个体嵌入。

Result: Maia4All仅需20局棋局即可高精度预测个体走棋和行为模式，数据效率显著提升。

Conclusion: Maia4All为个性化AI行为建模树立新标准，其方法可扩展至其他领域如个性化LLMs。

Abstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand
artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate
individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a
long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal
testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human
behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,
making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we
introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual
decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves
this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which
bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a
prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages
ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual
embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can
accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high
fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior
modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in
chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,
representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an
example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users
using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond
chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its
potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）简化供应链管理中的决策过程，减少对数据科学团队的依赖，并加速决策时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链管理中的决策工具虽然基于优化技术，但仍需大量时间和人力来解释结果、分析场景和更新模型。LLMs的进步为解决这些问题提供了可能。

Method: 应用大型语言模型（LLMs）来自动化解释工具结果、回答假设性问题，并动态更新数学模型。

Result: 通过LLMs，决策时间从几天或几周缩短至几分钟或几小时，显著提高了规划者和高管的效率和影响力。

Conclusion: LLMs能够民主化供应链技术，减少对专家的依赖，并大幅提升决策速度和生产力。

Abstract: Supply Chain Management requires addressing a variety of complex
decision-making challenges, from sourcing strategies to planning and execution.
Over the last few decades, advances in computation and information technologies
have enabled the transition from manual, intuition and experience-based
decision-making, into more automated and data-driven decisions using a variety
of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical
methods to improve decision-making.
  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend
considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations
coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer
what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools
to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires
involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results
or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows
down decision making.
  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report
how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -
namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the
interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we
report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus
substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and
hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity
and impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉语言任务中取得进展，但其在不可回答问题上的诚实行为尚未充分研究，需要系统评估和改进。

Method: 定义了四种视觉不可回答问题类型，构建了12k+样本的MoHoBench基准，评估了28种MLLMs的诚实行为，并尝试了监督和偏好学习对齐方法。

Result: 发现大多数模型无法适当拒绝回答，且诚实行为受视觉信息影响，需专门的多模态对齐方法。

Conclusion: 论文为未来可信MLLMs研究提供了基准和方法基础，数据与代码已开源。

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable
advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

Result: 提出了一种定义“世界模型”的方法，并确保其非平凡性。

Conclusion: 为研究神经网络中的世界模型提供了理论基础和操作框架。

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses
a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

TL;DR: ST-GDance是一种新颖的框架，通过解耦空间和时间依赖关系，优化了长期且无碰撞的群舞生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群舞生成需要同步多个舞者并保持空间协调，现有方法难以建模密集的时空交互，导致可扩展性问题和碰撞风险。

Method: 采用轻量级图卷积进行距离感知的空间建模，以及加速稀疏注意力进行高效的时间建模。

Result: 在AIOZ-GDance数据集上，ST-GDance优于现有基线，尤其在生成长且连贯的群舞序列方面表现突出。

Conclusion: ST-GDance显著降低了计算成本，同时确保了流畅且无碰撞的交互。

Abstract: Group dance generation from music has broad applications in film, gaming, and
animation production. However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while
maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length
increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of
motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense
spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer
collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel
framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize
long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph
convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse
attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces
computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.
Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group
dance sequences. Project page: https://yilliajing.github.io/ST-GDance-Website/.

versatility and efficiency, and enabling agentic LLMs with autonomous reasoning
and coordination capabilities. We highlight recent advances, practical case
studies, and the unique benefits of LLM-based approaches over traditional

Result: 通过动态记忆模型，AI能更精准地提供用户最可能关心的信息。

Conclusion: 个性化解释方法能有效提升AI解释的透明度和用户体验。

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire
to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However,
such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a
specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a
human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on
individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the
explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to
explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based
on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's
worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous
interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can
estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

Abstract: In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering
(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale
multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18
sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety
queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,
enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of
the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge
graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel
multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical
situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream
VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in
Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five
mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and
methodology for advancing research in traffic safety. Our source code and data

*Jiong Yin,Liang Li,Jiehua Zhang,Yuhan Gao,Chenggang Yan,Xichun Sheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种三阶段渐进式音频-视觉提示方法（PHP），用于多任务增量学习，通过任务共享和任务特定适配器平衡知识保留与新任务学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决音频-视觉多任务增量学习中如何保留旧任务知识并促进新任务学习的挑战。

Method: PHP方法分为三个阶段：浅层阶段（跨任务和跨模态表示学习）、中层阶段（任务特定模态共享动态生成适配器）和深层阶段（任务特定模态独立提示）。

Result: 在四个任务（AVE、AVVP、AVS和AVQA）的不同顺序中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PHP方法通过平衡知识共享和任务特异性，有效解决了多任务增量学习中的遗忘问题。

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

Result: 分析揭示了贝叶斯推理未成为现代具身智能核心的原因，并指出当前系统局限于封闭物理环境。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法有望在推动具身智能向开放物理世界发展方面发挥关键作用。

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge
from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with
its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous
inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled
probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as
probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The
core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including
perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can
be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite
the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied
intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in
today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian
and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental
lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as
highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This
analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in
the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals
that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to
closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian
methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open
physical-world embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单个智能体与单个人类的交互，忽略了团队协作中可读性决策的潜力。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种将可读性决策扩展到多智能体环境的方法，并在多智能体基准场景中验证其性能。

Result: 实验表明，包含可读性智能体的团队表现优于仅由标准最优行为智能体组成的团队。

Conclusion: 可读性决策在多智能体团队协作中具有显著优势，能够提升团队整体性能。

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential
decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works
that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for
deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one
agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible
decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In
this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent
settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We
showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our
proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with
a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with
standard optimal behaviour.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统人员配备方案中缺乏灵活性和自然语言交互的问题，同时实现持续的员工技能和偏好估计。

Method: 提出StaffPro代理，结合LLM和模块化算法，通过自然语言交互和持续反馈优化人员调度和员工画像。

Result: 在咨询公司模拟中，StaffPro成功估计员工属性并生成高质量调度方案。

Conclusion: StaffPro提供了一个稳健、可解释且以人为本的自动化人员管理解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular
algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making
abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined
challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and
scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and
profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and
other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a
formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature
estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and
profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro
allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts
textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts
directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,
ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent
continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long
worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A
consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully
estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its
innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric
solution for automated personnel management.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）比纯语言模型更容易受到有害输入的影响。研究通过探索模型内部动态，定义了三种关键能力（安全感知、语义理解和语言表达对齐），并提出了自我感知安全增强（SASA）技术，显著提升了模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs对有害输入的脆弱性比纯语言模型更显著，研究旨在理解其内部机制并提升安全性。

Method: 定义了三种关键能力（安全感知、语义理解和语言表达对齐），提出SASA技术，通过将中间层的语义信息投影到早期安全层来增强安全性，无需微调。

Result: SASA显著提升了LVLMs的安全性，且对模型实用性影响极小。

Conclusion: 通过SASA技术，可以有效增强LVLMs的安全性，同时保持其功能性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to harmful input compared
to their language-only backbones. We investigated this vulnerability by
exploring LVLMs internal dynamics, framing their inherent safety understanding
in terms of three key capabilities. Specifically, we define these capabilities
as safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment for linguistic
expression, and experimentally pinpointed their primary locations within the
model architecture. The results indicate that safety perception often emerges
before comprehensive semantic understanding, leading to the reduction in
safety. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{Self-Aware Safety
Augmentation (SASA)}, a technique that projects informative semantic
representations from intermediate layers onto earlier safety-oriented layers.
This approach leverages the model's inherent semantic understanding to enhance
safety recognition without fine-tuning. Then, we employ linear probing to
articulate the model's internal semantic comprehension to detect the risk
before the generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
tasks demonstrate that SASA significantly improves the safety of LVLMs, with
minimal impact on the utility.

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely
driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL
benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and
easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many
breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied
applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing
complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce
Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in
assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for
significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of
open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when
vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax
conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human
patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents
against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities
can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular
continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and
establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for
assistive robotics. The code is available at:

Abstract: This paper addresses the question of how able the current trends of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) are in managing to take the responsibility of a
full course of mathematics at a college level. The study evaluates this ability
in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting
selected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It
shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like
organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away
from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even
in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper
suggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to
create better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full
course of mathematics, at a university level, as best as possible.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BellNet的新方法，通过将策略迭代展开并截断为可学习的参数模型，以减少计算成本并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态规划方法在处理大规模状态-动作空间或长期依赖问题时计算成本高。

Method: 将策略迭代展开为可学习的参数模型BellNet，并通过最小化Bellman误差进行训练，同时借鉴图信号处理技术重新参数化。

Result: 初步实验表明，BellNet在网格环境中能以更少的迭代次数有效逼近最优策略。

Conclusion: BellNet提供了一种计算高效且可转移的动态规划新方法。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering
fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a
given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration
exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.
However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the
state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term
dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy
iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to
minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function
initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the
adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal
processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of
nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,
and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit
handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a
grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate
optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.

Conclusion: GDAIP在跨数据集场景下有效实现了个体脑分区。

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such
individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions
across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world
cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain
Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that
integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based
domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group
and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial
optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain
graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the
individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset
settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice
coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that
GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible
boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting
functional organization.

Conclusion: 边界拟合在ALC及其片段中具有理论优势，并通过SAT求解器实现验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Bounded fitting is a general paradigm for learning logical formulas from
positive and negative data examples, that has received considerable interest
recently. We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its
syntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting
problem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a
single positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes
with probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,
we show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not
provide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded
fitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss
optimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上，MCVCI和MCVCC表现出优于现有方法的综合性能。

Conclusion: MCVCI和MCVCC能有效处理异质性因果关系，为因果推断提供了新工具。

Abstract: Bivariate causal direction identification is a fundamental and vital problem
in the causal inference field. Among binary causal methods, most methods based
on additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal
model. In the real world, observations are always collected in different
environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation
data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference
model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the
identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the
superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural
network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic
bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision
criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and
propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method,
which can reveal causal mechanism expression. Compared with state-of-the-art
methods, the comprehensive best performance demonstrates the effectiveness of
the methods proposed in this paper on several simulated and real data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如FlowGRPO）在图像生成的人偏好对齐中效率低下，需要对所有去噪步骤进行采样和优化。

Method: MixGRPO引入滑动窗口机制，窗口内使用SDE采样和GRPO优化，窗口外使用ODE采样，减少优化开销并加速收敛。

Result: MixGRPO在多个维度上显著优于DanceGRPO，训练时间减少近50%，MixGRPO-Flash版本进一步减少71%。

Conclusion: MixGRPO通过混合采样策略和滑动窗口设计，高效提升了人偏好对齐的性能和训练速度。

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence agents represent the next major revolution in the
continuous technological evolution of industrial automation. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach for business process design and development that
leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional
task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based
method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,
identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a
goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of
multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent
business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and
agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware
automation in dynamic industrial environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将LLM作为端到端预测器导致数值精度损失或模态对齐困难，需改进。

Method: DualSG框架结合LLM语义指导和传统预测，引入时间序列描述（Time Series Caption）显式提示，并设计标题引导融合模块。

Result: 实验表明DualSG在多个领域数据集上优于15种基线方法。

Conclusion: 显式结合数值预测与语义指导能显著提升多变量时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications.
Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take
advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as
end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and
forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,
methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent
space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to
treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules
within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that
provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to
refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we
introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend
patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,
rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the
latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly
models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.
Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value
of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding
the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal
recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce
uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and
propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal
recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our
strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as
a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward
more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出EDGE-GRPO算法，通过熵驱动优势和引导错误校正解决GRPO算法中的优势崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法因稀疏奖励规则导致组内奖励相同，引发优势崩溃问题，现有方法主要通过模型反思和内部反馈解决。

Method: 分析模型反思的局限性，研究细粒度样本级别的策略熵，提出EDGE-GRPO算法。

Result: 在多个主要推理基准测试中验证了算法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: EDGE-GRPO算法能有效缓解优势崩溃问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing
step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward
rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading
to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this
challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response
diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal
(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model
reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the
fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the
EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage
and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the
problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is

Conclusion: MultiEditor通过创新的多模态编辑框架，有效解决了自动驾驶数据的长尾分布问题，提升了罕见类别的感知性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to
understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of
real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical
vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a
dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point
clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target
objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control
mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and
multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across
modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality
condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities
using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior
performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and
cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data
with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception
models on underrepresented classes.

Motivation: GNNs在预测任务中表现优异，但缺乏符号化领域知识和通用推理能力；RBNs支持生成式概率建模和符号推理，但学习能力有限。

Method: 开发了两种集成方法：一种将GNNs直接编译为RBNs语言，另一种保持GNNs为外部组件。还提出了最大后验（MAP）推理方法。

Result: 在节点分类和环境规划两个应用中验证了框架的有效性，显著提高了准确性并支持复杂决策。

Conclusion: 该框架为图数据提供了一种强大的神经符号方法，结合了学习和推理能力，适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications
and improved performance across diverse tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GitHub仓库的README文件质量影响其采用和利用，但许多仓库所有者忽视推荐内容，限制了仓库的潜力。

Method: 研究微调三种编码器型LLMs（BERT、DistilBERT、RoBERTa），使用4226个README文件节段的数据集，并探索PEFT技术如LoRA。

Result: 方法优于现有技术，F1分数达0.98，PEFT技术在性能损失较小的情况下提供经济替代方案。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于自动分类GitHub README文件内容，为改进仓库识别和利用提供自动化工具。

Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and
managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.
The README files should contain project-related information as per the
recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.
However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.
This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This
research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file
significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail
potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact
within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great
performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text
generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach
is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections
of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,
DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a
gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1
score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without
compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using
LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of
GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of
automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and
potential usages.

Result: 在六个数据集上的详细案例研究表明，该方法能有效支持零样本HAR系统。

Conclusion: 通过自然语言嵌入建模，提供了一种无需LLM的零样本HAR解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical
direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR
systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and
activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are
based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and
feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification.
Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry
several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and
inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative
zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we
propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural
language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and
thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The
impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets,
highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot
recognition.

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due
to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In
this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of
annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our
evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these
problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this
issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning
quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to
integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic
explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong
generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the
promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and
explainable RCA in network operation and management.

Conclusion: PHAX通过将形式化推理与沟通需求结合，推动了公共卫生领域透明、以人为中心的AI发展。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical
sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands
explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While
explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model
interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed
for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the
general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and
eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate
human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture
combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user
modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More
specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting
AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive
dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through
use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,
and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions
can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user
expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal
reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader
vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

Abstract: While the last decade has witnessed significant advancements in Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, performance of these systems for individuals
with speech disabilities remains inadequate, partly due to limited public
training data. To bridge this gap, the 2025 Interspeech Speech Accessibility
Project (SAP) Challenge was launched, utilizing over 400 hours of SAP data
collected and transcribed from more than 500 individuals with diverse speech
disabilities. Hosted on EvalAI and leveraging the remote evaluation pipeline,
the SAP Challenge evaluates submissions based on Word Error Rate and Semantic
Score. Consequently, 12 out of 22 valid teams outperformed the whisper-large-v2
baseline in terms of WER, while 17 teams surpassed the baseline on SemScore.
Notably, the top team achieved the lowest WER of 8.11\%, and the highest
SemScore of 88.44\% at the same time, setting new benchmarks for future ASR
systems in recognizing impaired speech.
