### [1] [Top-of-atmosphere radiation fields over the last millennium reconstructed from proxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09896)
*Dominik Stiller,Gregory J. Hakim*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 通过结合代理数据和模型动力学，重建了过去千年（850-2000年）的顶部大气辐射和地表变量，揭示了地球能量不平衡的历史变化模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球能量不平衡是重要的气候系统指标，但观测记录短且耦合气候模型存在较大不确定性，现有海洋热含量重建无法区分短波和长波辐射的贡献。

Method: 结合代理数据和模型动力学，利用季节性网格化数据同化方法，通过辐射与对地表温度敏感的代理数据之间的协方差进行重建。

Result: 发现过去千年存在冷却趋势与逐渐减缓的热量损失，火山喷发后上层海洋热含量需要5-10年才开始恢复，1980年后所有20年期的能量不平衡在工业前时期都是前所未有的。

Conclusion: 重建揭示了地球能量不平衡的长期变化模式，特别是火山喷发对气候系统的长期影响，以及现代时期能量不平衡的异常性。

Abstract: Earth's energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere is a key climate system
metric, but its variability is poorly constrained by the short observational
record and large uncertainty in coupled climate models. While existing ocean
heat content reconstructions offer a longer perspective, they cannot separate
the contributions of shortwave and longwave radiation, obscuring the underlying
processes. We extend the energy budget record by reconstructing the
top-of-atmosphere radiation and related surface variables over the last
millennium (850--2000 CE). Our method combines proxy data and model dynamics
using seasonal, gridded data assimilation, exploiting the covariance of
radiation with proxies sensitive to surface temperatures. The method validates
well in a pseudoproxy experiment and against instrumental observations. We find
that a last-millennium cooling trend coincides with heat loss that gradually
slowed, although there are intermittent multidecadal periods of energy gain.
The cooling trend is associated with a southwestward shift of Indo--Pacific
convection and growth of sea ice, with seasonal sea ice trends following
orbital-scale changes in polar insolation. We also find that the upper-ocean
heat content following large volcanic eruptions does not begin to recover until
5--10 years later, suggesting the initiation of the Little Ice Age by
decadally-paced eruptions in the early 1100s and late 1200s. Indeed, the latter
period marks the decade of largest energy loss over the last millennium. Our
reconstruction reveals that the energy imbalance for all 20-yr periods after
1980 is unprecedented in the pre-industrial period.

### [2] [Generative Modeling of Aerosol State Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10361)
*Ehsan Saleh,Saba Ghaffari,Jeffrey H. Curtis,Lekha Patel,Peter A. Bosler,Nicole Riemer,Matthew West*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 提出基于变分自编码器(VAE)的框架，将高维气溶胶状态压缩为10个潜在变量，同时保持云凝结核、光学特性和冰核特性的物理诊断精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气溶胶-云-辐射相互作用是气候系统中不确定性最大的组成部分之一，需要将复杂的气溶胶特性压缩为紧凑且物理意义明确的表示形式。

Method: 使用深度变分自编码器模型学习气溶胶质量和数浓度分布，引入预处理优化策略提高鲁棒性，并提出基于切片Wasserstein距离的真实性度量来优化VAE的KL散度权重。

Result: CCN谱最容易准确重构，光学特性中等难度，冰核特性最具挑战性。预处理优化策略显著提高了CCN谱、光学系数和冻结分数谱的精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模气候应用提供了紧凑、鲁棒且物理意义明确的气溶胶状态表示。

Abstract: Aerosol-cloud--radiation interactions remain among the most uncertain
components of the Earth's climate system, in partdue to the high dimensionality
of aerosol state representations and the difficulty of obtaining complete
\textit{in situ} measurements. Addressing these challenges requires methods
that distill complex aerosol properties into compact yet physically meaningful
forms. Generative autoencoder models provide such a pathway. We present a
framework for learning deep variational autoencoder (VAE) models of speciated
mass and number concentration distributions, which capture detailed aerosol
size-composition characteristics. By compressing hundreds of original
dimensions into ten latent variables, the approach enables efficient storage
and processing while preserving the fidelity of key diagnostics, including
cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) spectra, optical scattering and absorption
coefficients, and ice nucleation properties. Results show that CCN spectra are
easiest to reconstruct accurately, optical properties are moderately difficult,
and ice nucleation properties are the most challenging. To improve performance,
we introduce a preprocessing optimization strategy that avoids repeated
retraining and yields latent representations resilient to high-magnitude
Gaussian noise, boosting accuracy for CCN spectra, optical coefficients, and
frozen fraction spectra. Finally, we propose a novel realism metric -- based on
the sliced Wasserstein distance between generated samples and a held-out test
set -- for optimizing the KL divergence weight in VAEs. Together, these
contributions enable compact, robust, and physically meaningful representations
of aerosol states for large-scale climate applications.

### [3] [Interactive Atmospheric Composition Emulation for Next-Generation Earth System Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10654)
*Seyed Mohammad Hassan Erfani,Kara Lamb,Susanne Bauer,Kostas Tsigaridis,Marcus van Lier-Walqui,Gavin Schmidt*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 使用机器学习开发了Smart NINT方法，在NASA GISS-ModelE3中替代预计算的大气成分浓度，通过表面排放和气象数据实时模拟交互式排放，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球系统模型中的交互式成分模拟计算成本高昂，限制了高分辨率瞬态气候模拟。现有的非交互示踪剂方法虽然减少计算量，但无法捕捉气溶胶与其他气候过程的实时反馈。

Method: 采用机器学习方法创建Smart NINT，利用时空架构有效捕捉示踪剂演化的空间和时间依赖性，使用表面排放和气象数据作为输入，避免完整的物理参数化。

Result: 模型表现优异，第一压力层的R平方值为0.92，Pearson相关系数为0.96。即使在训练域外完全不同的时间段数据上测试，仍保持可接受的性能。

Conclusion: Smart NINT方法在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算成本，为需要可靠长期预测的气候建模应用提供了关键能力。

Abstract: Interactive composition simulations in Earth System Models (ESMs) are
computationally expensive as they transport numerous gaseous and aerosol
tracers at each timestep. This limits higher-resolution transient climate
simulations with current computational resources. ESMs like NASA GISS-ModelE3
(ModelE) often use pre-computed monthly-averaged atmospheric composition
concentrations (Non-Interactive Tracers or NINT) to reduce computational costs.
While NINT significantly cuts computations, it fails to capture real-time
feedback between aerosols and other climate processes by relying on
pre-calculated fields. We extended the ModelE NINT version using machine
learning (ML) to create Smart NINT, which emulates interactive emissions. Smart
NINT interactively calculates concentrations using ML with surface emissions
and meteorological data as inputs, avoiding full physics parameterizations. Our
approach utilizes a spatiotemporal architecture that possesses a well-matched
inductive bias to effectively capture the spatial and temporal dependencies in
tracer evolution. Input data processed through the first 20 vertical levels
(from the surface up to 656 hPa) using the ModelE OMA scheme. This vertical
range covers nearly the entire BCB concentration distribution in the
troposphere, where significant variation on short time horizons due to
surface-level emissions is observed. Our evaluation shows excellent model
performance with R-squared values of 0.92 and Pearson-r of 0.96 at the first
pressure level. This high performance continues through level 15 (808.5 hPa),
then gradually decreases as BCB concentrations drop significantly. The model
maintains acceptable performance even when tested on data from entirely
different periods outside the training domain, which is a crucial capability
for climate modeling applications requiring reliable long-term projections.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: CaDRO是一个因果引导的维度缩减框架，通过因果发现识别对电路性能有显著影响的参数，固定低影响参数来加速多目标优化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统进化算法如NSGA-II在模拟电路多目标优化中面临高维参数空间和昂贵仿真的挑战，对所有参数平等处理导致效率低下。

Method: CaDRO通过混合观测-干预过程构建定量因果图，根据参数对目标的因果效应进行排序，固定低影响参数，仅对关键参数进行优化搜索。

Result: 在放大器、稳压器和射频电路中，CaDRO比NSGA-II收敛速度快10倍，同时保持或改进Pareto质量。例如折叠共源共栅放大器的超体积从0.56提升到0.94。

Conclusion: CaDRO通过因果引导的维度缩减有效解决了模拟电路多目标优化的可扩展性问题，显著提高了优化效率和质量。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization of analog circuits is hindered by
high-dimensional parameter spaces, strong feedback couplings, and expensive
transistor-level simulations. Evolutionary algorithms such as Non-dominated
Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are widely used but treat all parameters
equally, thereby wasting effort on variables with little impact on performance,
which limits their scalability. We introduce CaDRO, a causal-guided
dimensionality reduction framework that embeds causal discovery into the
optimization pipeline. CaDRO builds a quantitative causal map through a hybrid
observational-interventional process, ranking parameters by their causal effect
on the objectives. Low-impact parameters are fixed to values from high-quality
solutions, while critical drivers remain active in the search. The reduced
design space enables focused evolutionary optimization without modifying the
underlying algorithm. Across amplifiers, regulators, and RF circuits, CaDRO
converges up to 10$\times$ faster than NSGA-II while preserving or improving
Pareto quality. For instance, on the Folded-Cascode Amplifier, hypervolume
improves from 0.56 to 0.94, and on the LDO regulator from 0.65 to 0.81, with
large gains in non-dominated solutions.

Result: 在CADPrompt基准数据集上评估，EvoCAD在多个指标上优于先前方法，特别是在拓扑正确性方面表现突出

Conclusion: EvoCAD方法有效提升了CAD对象生成的质量，新提出的基于欧拉特征的拓扑指标能够有效补充现有空间指标

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

TL;DR: 提出TinyViT-Batten框架，使用少量样本的Vision Transformer检测早期Batten病，在79例确诊患者和90例对照的MRI数据上达到91%准确率和0.95 AUC，优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batten病是一种罕见的儿科神经退行性疾病，早期MRI征象细微且常被漏诊，需要开发能够在有限训练样本下准确检测的AI方法。

Method: 将大型教师ViT蒸馏为500万参数的TinyViT，使用基于度量的少样本学习（原型损失，5-shot episodes）进行微调，并集成Grad-CAM提供可解释性。

Conclusion: 该模型的小尺寸和强性能展示了早期Batten病检测的实用AI解决方案，通过Grad-CAM提供可解释的预测。

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for
medical image analysis. Constructed by integrating pivotal features from neural
networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models, TreeNet emerges as
a potent and adaptable model capable of delivering superior performance across
diverse and intricate machine learning tasks. Furthermore, its interpretability
and insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex
medical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics

methodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete
training data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\% of the training
data. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\%
of the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology
resulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime
applications. This comprehensive assessment underscores the efficiency and

### [9] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Omni Swift Action Tokenizer (OmniSAT)，通过B样条编码和多阶段残差量化技术，将高维连续动作序列压缩为紧凑的离散表示，使训练序列缩短6.8倍，同时保持重建质量，提升自回归模型的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归VLA模型在处理长序列动作时面临效率问题，之前的压缩方法存在重建质量差或压缩效率低的问题，需要一种既能高效压缩又能保持重建质量的动作表示方法。

Method: 使用B样条编码进行值域和时间范围归一化，然后对位置、旋转和夹爪子空间应用多阶段残差量化，生成具有粗细粒度的压缩离散标记。

Result: 在Droid大规模数据集上预训练后，离散标记化使训练序列缩短6.8倍，降低目标熵，在多样化真实机器人和仿真实验中实现了更高的压缩比和更好的重建质量。

Conclusion: OmniSAT方法在保持重建质量的同时实现了高效的动作序列压缩，促进了自回归模型的快速训练收敛和性能提升，并支持跨具身学习的统一动作模式空间构建。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

Motivation: 解决MODIS变化检测中的关键挑战：混合像素、时空谱信息耦合效应和背景类别异质性。

Method: 1. 知识驱动的转换矩阵方法(KAT-loss)；2. 多任务学习方法(PreC-loss、PostC-loss、Chg-loss)；3. 时空谱Mamba模块(SSTMamba)；4. 稀疏可变形Mamba骨干网络(SDMamba)。

Conclusion: KAMamba方法有效解决了MODIS变化检测的核心挑战，在准确性和效率方面都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NNDM混合框架，结合NN-UNet的稳健特征提取和扩散概率模型的生成能力，通过迭代去噪过程提升脑肿瘤MRI分割的准确性和边界精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有卷积神经网络（如U-Net）在脑肿瘤MRI分割中存在泛化能力不足、边界精度差和数据多样性有限的问题，需要改进模型性能。

Method: 将NN-UNet与扩散概率模型结合，扩散模型通过学习预测分割掩码与真实掩码之间的残差分布，逐步优化NN-UNet生成的分割结果。

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上的实验表明，NNDM在Dice系数和Hausdorff距离指标上优于传统U-Net和基于transformer的基线方法。

Conclusion: NNDM为确定性分割网络与随机扩散模型的结合开辟了新方向，推进了自动化脑肿瘤分析的技术水平。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的微表情识别方法，通过两种互补表示（时间排序动态图像和运动强度动态图像）以及自适应融合网络，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情是细微、短暂的面部变化，强度极低，几乎无法被肉眼察觉，但能揭示人的真实情绪，在谎言检测、行为分析和心理评估中具有重要价值。

Conclusion: 输入表示和所提架构在提升微表情识别性能中都发挥重要作用，为情感计算、谎言检测和人机交互领域的进一步研究和实际应用提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp是一种轻量级方法，通过交叉模态注意力对输入图像进行线性扭曲，在不改变模型权重或架构的情况下，将空间分辨率重新分配到模型认为重要的区域，从而提升多模态大语言模型在细粒度感知任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在杂乱场景中经常忽略小细节和空间关系，导致细粒度感知任务出错。需要一种方法在不修改模型的情况下提升其对重要区域的关注度。

Method: 利用MLLM的交叉模态注意力对输入图像进行线性扭曲，将更多分辨率分配给查询相关的内容，同时压缩信息较少的区域，同时保持全局上下文。

Result: 在五个基准测试和四个MLLM上，AttWarp持续提高准确性，增强组合推理能力，减少幻觉，优于四种竞争性基线方法。

Conclusion: 注意力引导的扭曲能够优先处理与查询相关的信息同时保持上下文，相同的MLLM在接收这种扭曲输入时表现更好。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

TL;DR: 研究多模态语境下外语学习者如何通过图像-句子配对推断陌生词汇含义，分析影响推断成功的数据特征和参与者语言背景，并评估AI系统预测学习者表现的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索外语学习的新场景，研究学习者在图像-句子配对的多模态语境中推断陌生词汇含义的能力，识别促进词汇习得的关键数据特征。

Method: 通过人类参与者实验，使用不同的图像-文本配对数据，分析图像和文本特征对推断成功的影响，以及参与者语言背景与表现的相关性。

Result: 发现只有部分直观特征与参与者表现强相关，需要进一步研究预测性特征；AI系统在推理参与者表现方面显示出改进潜力。

Conclusion: 多模态语境为外语词汇学习提供了有效途径，但需要更深入理解影响推断成功的关键特征，AI系统在此任务中具有发展前景。

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应分辨率选择方法，通过分析图像复杂性和VLLM不确定性来确定最佳分辨率，并使用参数高效微调技术扩展预训练VLLM的视觉输入分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉大语言模型通常预设固定分辨率，导致在不同视觉语言任务中性能不佳，需要根据任务需求自适应选择最佳分辨率。

Method: 1. 分析不同视觉语言任务的分辨率偏好与图像复杂性和VLLM不确定性的相关性；2. 提出经验公式确定最佳分辨率；3. 使用参数高效微调技术扩展预训练VLLM的分辨率。

Result: 在多种视觉语言任务上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够自适应地为不同视觉语言任务选择最佳分辨率，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于卫星图像特征质量较低，导致图像分割结果不够清晰，需要寻找合适的CRF模型来改善分割效果。

Method: 研究比较了不同类型的条件随机场(CRF)模型，在低质量卫星图像和高质量航拍图像两个数据集上进行实验评估。

Result: 通过实验找到了在不同类型图像上表现最佳的CRF模型，并揭示了各种方法的优缺点。

Conclusion: 研究表明选择合适的CRF模型可以显著提升图像分割的清晰度，特别是在低质量卫星图像上效果改善明显。

Abstract: The output of image the segmentation process is usually not very clear due to
low quality features of Satellite images. The purpose of this study is to find
a suitable Conditional Random Field (CRF) to achieve better clarity in a
segmented image. We started with different types of CRFs and studied them as to
why they are or are not suitable for our purpose. We evaluated our approach on
two different datasets - Satellite imagery having low quality features and high
quality Aerial photographs. During the study we experimented with various CRFs

*David Benavente-Rios,Juan Ruiz Rodriguez,Gustavo Gatica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用合成人脸数据增强单形态攻击检测(S-MAD)，通过增量测试协议评估合成数据对泛化能力的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于隐私问题导致真实图像大规模数据集可用性受限的问题。

Method: 使用多种形态工具和跨数据集评估方案，实施增量测试协议来评估随着合成图像增加时的泛化能力。

Result: 谨慎控制合成图像数量或逐步添加真实图像可以改善泛化能力，但无差别使用合成数据会导致性能下降。仅使用合成数据会获得最高的等错误率。

Conclusion: 在操作场景中，最佳选择不是仅依赖合成数据进行S-MAD，需要谨慎控制合成数据的使用。

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ceb的新型像素聚类方法，利用细胞边界特征和标签将前景像素分割成细胞实例，在六个数据集上的实验表明其优于现有像素聚类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的细胞实例分割方法使用像素级目标（如距离图、热扩散图等）可能会丢失细胞实例的重要几何特性（如形状、曲率、凸性），这些特性需要像素集合来表示。

Method: Ceb方法首先从语义分割概率图中提取潜在的细胞边界，然后为每个边界候选构建边界特征表示（边界签名），使用边界分类器预测其二元边界标签，最后基于预测的边界标签通过分割或合并相邻区域获得细胞实例。

Result: 在六个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Ceb在语义分割概率图上优于现有的像素聚类方法，并且与最先进的细胞实例分割方法相比具有高度竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Ceb方法通过利用细胞边界特征有效解决了像素级目标丢失几何特性的问题，在细胞实例分割任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CAPEL框架，通过聚类感知的提示集成学习解决传统提示集成方法中特征平均导致类别中心偏移的问题，在分类logits空间进行集成，并引入聚类保持正则化和自适应提示权重技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示集成方法通过平均文本特征来集成上下文提示，但这种方法会偏离真实的类别分布，导致次优结果。需要一种能保持提示聚类特性的集成方法。

Method: CAPEL框架将图像分类到由不同提示表示的类别聚类中，在分类logits空间而非特征空间进行集成，引入聚类保持正则化保持提示的区分性，并使用自适应提示权重技术动态调整有缺陷或模糊提示的注意力权重。

Result: 该方法能更好地对齐视觉特征分布，保持提示的聚类特性，防止提示崩溃到统一方向，在多样化数据集和任务上实现鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: CAPEL框架通过聚类感知的提示集成学习，有效解决了传统提示集成方法的局限性，在保持提示区分性的同时提升了零样本分类性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多目标跟踪方法，通过融合深度和掩码特征生成稳定的目标表示，作为边界框IoU和重识别特征的补充相似性线索，避免了计算分割掩码IoU的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MOT方法依赖IoU进行关联，但在目标相似或遮挡时不可靠，且计算分割掩码IoU计算成本高。需要更稳定高效的目标表示方法。

Method: 使用零样本深度估计器和提示式视觉分割模型获取深度图和目标掩码，通过自监督训练的紧凑编码器融合深度和掩码特征，生成稳定目标表示，与边界框IoU和重识别特征结合进行匹配。

Result: 在具有非线性运动、遮挡和拥挤场景的挑战性基准（如SportsMOT和DanceTrack）上，该方法在大多数指标上优于TBD最新技术，在简单线性运动基准（如MOT17）上达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 该方法首次使用自监督编码器来优化分割掩码而不计算掩码IoU，为多目标跟踪提供了更稳定高效的目标表示方案。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR视频质量评估数据集主要关注专业生成内容，缺乏对用户生成HDR视频在真实场景下质量退化的理解，需要专门针对UGC-HDR的质量评估数据集。

Method: 通过Amazon Mechanical Turk进行大规模主观研究，收集856个UGC-HDR源视频，在不同分辨率和比特率下转码生成5,992个视频，获得211,848个感知评分。

Result: 创建了首个大规模UGC-HDR视频质量数据集CHUG，为分析HDR视频中UGC特有的失真提供了基准，数据集已公开可用。

Conclusion: CHUG数据集将推动无参考HDR视频质量评估研究，提供了一个大规模、多样化且真实世界的UGC数据集资源。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,
and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景具有不规则布局和变化复杂度，包含杂乱、遮挡和平坦墙面，需要最大化有限资源的利用率。

Method: 在估计的几何支架上记录观测统计，指导基函数的最优放置；提出场景自适应虚拟视点来补偿输入轨迹中的几何缺陷并施加正则化。

Result: 在多个大规模室内场景中，相比采用规则放置的基线方法，在渲染质量和内存需求方面都显示出显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于几何先验的场景自适应策略能够有效提升NeRF表示在复杂室内环境中的性能表现。

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LTGS提出了一种用于稀疏视角更新的长期高斯场景时序表示方法，能够从高度受限的日常捕捉中处理场景变化，通过对象模板高斯和精炼流程实现高效的时间演化3D环境重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的新视角合成方法在处理日常环境时面临挑战，因为场景频繁变化需要密集的空间和时间观测。现有的方法难以从稀疏、非结构化的捕捉中建模长期场景时序。

Method: 从不完整的高斯泼溅表示出发，构建对象模板高斯作为结构化的可重用先验，然后通过少样本观测的精炼流程调整先验以适应时间变化的环境，通过简单变换实现多时间步的泛化。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在重建质量上优于其他基线方法，同时支持快速轻量级的更新，在真实世界数据集上验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: LTGS提供了一种高效处理日常环境长期变化的场景表示方法，显著提升了3D环境时间演化的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个多视角动物姿态估计框架，结合多视角变换器、几何一致性增强、改进的集成卡尔曼平滑器和知识蒸馏技术，在有限标注数据下实现准确且具有不确定性估计的姿态跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视角姿态估计方法在有限标注数据下准确性不足，且缺乏可靠的不确定性估计，难以满足科学研究中动物行为量化的需求。

Method: 使用多视角变换器(MVT)同时处理所有视角信息，采用补丁掩码方案学习跨视角对应关系；对于标定系统，引入3D增强和三角化损失；扩展非线性集成卡尔曼平滑器(EKS)并改进不确定性量化；设计知识蒸馏流程利用改进的EKS预测生成高质量伪标签。

Conclusion: 该框架为现实世界数据约束下的可靠姿态估计提供了实用解决方案，支持下游行为分析应用。

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Conclusion: 所提出的架构有效提升了无人机感知能力，为复杂环境下的导航、监视和监测任务提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

### [27] [HeadsUp! High-Fidelity Portrait Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09924)
*Renjie Li,Zihao Zhu,Xiaoyu Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HeadsUp模型，一种单步扩散模型，用于端到端地无缝恢复和放大肖像图像，解决了现有方法在面部区域处理时产生的边界伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像超分辨率技术要么专注于通用真实世界图像，要么专注于严格对齐的面部图像。在实践中，需要混合不同模型来处理肖像照片，但这种方法不可避免地会在面部区域引入混合或边界伪影，而人类感知对面部保真度特别敏感。

Method: 在单步扩散模型基础上构建，开发了面部监督机制来引导模型关注面部区域，并整合了基于参考的机制来帮助身份恢复，减少低质量面部恢复中的面部模糊。此外，构建了高质量的4K肖像图像超分辨率数据集PortraitSR-4K。

Result: 广泛实验表明，HeadsUp在肖像图像超分辨率任务上实现了最先进的性能，同时在通用图像和对齐面部数据集上保持相当或更高的性能。

Conclusion: HeadsUp通过端到端的单步扩散模型有效解决了肖像图像超分辨率问题，避免了混合模型带来的边界伪影，并在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

*Nilesh Jain,Elie Alhajjar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用去噪扩散模型扩展水下图像数据集多样性，并利用Controlnet增强图像质量，以解决现有水下图像数据集质量差、类型单一的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像在海洋研究中至关重要，但复杂环境导致图像质量差（低可见度、模糊、色彩失真等）。现有图像增强方法泛化能力差且过度依赖高质量数据集，而当前数据集缺乏多样性且多为单目图像。

Method: 1. 使用去噪扩散模型扩展数据集，增加立体、广角、微距和特写等多种图像类型；2. 利用Controlnet评估和增强图像质量。

Result: 通过扩散模型生成多样化图像类型，结合Controlnet提升图像质量，为海洋生态系统研究提供更丰富、高质量的数据支持。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效克服现有水下图像数据集的局限性，通过数据扩展和质量增强，显著改善海洋生态系统研究的图像数据基础。

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

*Agampreet Aulakh,Nils D. Forkert,Matthias Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的新方法，用于建模脑部衰老轨迹，能够处理纵向MRI数据中的不规则采样问题，并在脑衰老轨迹分类任务中优于传统深度学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类大脑在整个生命周期中经历动态的结构变化，纵向MRI数据对于表征典型和非典型衰老轨迹很有价值。但由于数据的离散性和不同空间时间采样模式，传统深度学习方法难以表示潜在的连续生物过程。

Method: 使用隐式神经表示（INR）将受试者特定的纵向T1加权MRI数据建模为连续函数，引入新颖的INR架构部分解耦空间和时间轨迹参数，并设计直接在INR参数空间操作的分类框架。

Result: 在更现实的不规则采样实验中，基于INR的方法在脑衰老轨迹分类任务中达到81.3%的准确率，优于标准深度学习基线模型（73.7%）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理纵向神经影像数据中的不规则采样问题，为脑衰老轨迹分析提供了新的连续建模框架。

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

TL;DR: 提出了一种人机交互的干预学习框架，通过人类对分割结果的针对性修正来引导模型学习鲁棒的语义特征，而非虚假相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割模型在基准测试中表现良好，但在真实场景中容易依赖虚假相关性而非真实物体边界，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 将人类修正视为干预信号，通过传播修正信息到视觉相似的图像，系统性地纠正模型的失败模式，引导模型学习语义上有意义的特征。

Result: 在挑战性立方体地图数据上分割准确率提升高达9 mIoU点（相对提升12-15%），标注工作量减少3-4倍，同时在基准数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究人员和从业者提供了构建准确、鲁棒、数据高效且适应真实世界领域的分割系统的实用方法。

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

Motivation: 医学图像分割对诊断和治疗至关重要，但人工分割耗时且存在变异性，AI方法需要大量标注数据且泛化能力有限。

Method: 联合训练分割模型和检索模型，分割模型利用检索到的图像-掩码对增强解剖理解，检索模型学习分割相关特征。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上，SegFormer结合J-RAS将Dice分数从0.8708提升到0.9115，Hausdorff距离从1.8130降低到1.1489。

Conclusion: J-RAS方法有效提升了分割性能，具有良好的泛化能力，适用于不同架构和数据集。

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

TL;DR: 开发了一个端到端的AI框架，利用现有交通摄像头进行大规模高分辨率交通分析，通过YOLOv11模型提取交通密度和分类指标，使用图基视角归一化方法处理动态摄像头视角，并集成领域特定的LLM自动生成交通模式总结。


<details>

Motivation: 传统交通监测传感器部署成本高，而现有视频分析技术难以处理大规模摄像头网络的动态视角和海量数据，需要一种成本效益高且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

Motivation: 现有光晕数据集通常通过将人工光晕模板叠加到背景图像上来合成，但模板多样性不足且忽视物理原理，导致模型在真实场景中泛化能力差。

Method: 提出三阶段物理信息光晕数据生成方法：参数化模板创建、光照规律感知的2D合成、基于物理引擎的3D渲染，最终得到包含9500个2D模板和3000个3D渲染图像对的混合数据集FlareX。

Conclusion: 大量实验证明了所提方法和数据集的有效性，能够显著提升光晕去除模型在真实场景中的性能表现。

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了BurstDeflicker数据集，通过三种互补的数据采集策略解决闪烁伪影去除研究中缺乏大规模真实数据集的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 滚动快门相机与交流电照明之间的相互作用导致短曝光图像中出现闪烁伪影，表现为不均匀的亮度分布和暗带。这些伪影不仅影响图像质量，还影响物体检测和跟踪等高级任务。缺乏大规模真实数据集阻碍了闪烁去除研究的进展。

Method: 1. 开发基于Retinex的合成流水线，可控制关键闪烁属性；2. 从不同场景捕获4000张真实闪烁图像；3. 提出绿屏方法在动态场景中保留真实闪烁退化。

Result: 构建了一个可扩展的基准数据集，包含合成、真实和动态场景的闪烁图像，能够帮助模型更好地理解闪烁伪影的时空特性。

Conclusion: 综合实验证明了该数据集的有效性及其在推进闪烁去除研究方面的潜力。

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

Motivation: 现有医疗视觉语言模型存在两个局限：输入仅依赖文本指令而缺乏对图像视觉线索的直接理解；输出仅提供文本答案而缺乏与图像关键区域的连接。

Method: 提出统一的医疗视觉语言模型MIMO，具备视觉参考多模态输入和像素定位多模态输出能力。构建了包含89.5万样本的MIMOSeg数据集，从四个不同角度覆盖基础指令跟随和复杂问答任务。

Result: 在多个下游医疗多模态任务上的实验结果表明，MIMO能够独特地结合视觉参考和像素定位能力，这是先前模型所不具备的。

Conclusion: MIMO模型成功解决了医疗视觉语言模型在输入和输出方面的局限性，通过视觉参考和像素定位能力实现了对复杂医疗图像和语义的更好理解与表达。

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

TL;DR: 提出了Query-Adapter（Q-Adapter），一种轻量级视觉适配器模块，通过引入可学习查询令牌和门控层来增强多模态大语言模型，在视频字幕任务中实现高效微调，仅需1.4%参数即可达到与全微调方法相竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统全模型微调在大模型时代计算成本过高的问题，以及现有参数高效微调方法主要关注语言组件而缺乏对视觉信息理解的不足。

Method: Q-Adapter在视觉编码器中引入可学习查询令牌和门控层，无需外部文本监督即可有效提取稀疏的、与字幕相关的特征。

Result: 在MSR-VTT和MSVD数据集上，Q-Adapter在参数高效微调方法中取得了最先进的性能，在BLEU@4、METEOR、ROUGE-L和CIDEr指标上表现优异，同时仅需1.4%的参数即可达到与全微调方法相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: Q-Adapter在平衡字幕质量和参数效率方面展现出强大潜力，证明了其在视频语言建模中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

TL;DR: P-4DGS是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的动态场景压缩表示方法，通过时空预测和自适应量化实现高效4D重建，显著降低存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态3D高斯泼溅方法忽略了场景中的时空冗余，导致内存消耗过高，需要一种更紧凑的4D场景表示方法。

Method: 设计基于3D锚点的时空预测模块来利用高斯基元间的时空相关性，结合自适应量化和上下文熵编码进一步压缩锚点数据。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实现最先进的重建质量和最快渲染速度，平均存储仅约1MB，压缩比达40-90倍。

Conclusion: P-4DGS通过有效利用时空相关性，在保持高质量重建的同时显著降低了动态3D高斯泼溅的存储需求。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and

### [39] [Complementary and Contrastive Learning for Audio-Visual Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10051)
*Sitong Gong,Yunzhi Zhuge,Lu Zhang,Pingping Zhang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CCFormer框架，通过早期融合模块、多查询Transformer模块和双模态对比学习，有效处理音频-视觉分割任务，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法受限于局部感受野，而Transformer方法难以充分提取多模态系数和时间动态。需要克服这些限制来提升音频-视觉分割性能。

Method: CCFormer包含三个核心组件：早期融合模块并行处理多尺度视觉特征和音频数据；多查询Transformer模块动态赋予音频查询学习能力，同时建模帧级和视频级关系；双模态对比学习促进统一特征空间中的模态对齐。

Result: 在S4、MS3和AVSS数据集上均达到了新的最先进性能基准。

Conclusion: CCFormer通过有效结合局部和全局信息处理、时空上下文捕捉以及跨模态互补性增强，显著提升了音频-视觉分割性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

TL;DR: ViTAR是一个模仿人类专家迭代推理过程的医学视觉语言模型框架，通过"思考-行动-重新思考-回答"的认知链进行多步骤视觉推理，在医学诊断任务中优于现有最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型通常依赖单次推理，忽略了局部视觉线索，而人类专家在临床实践中会迭代扫描、聚焦和优化感兴趣区域。ViTAR旨在缩小这种机器与人类感知差距。

Method: 提出ViTAR框架，将医学图像视为交互对象，采用"思考-行动-重新思考-回答"的认知链进行多步骤视觉推理。构建了1K交互示例和16K视觉问答训练数据，采用两阶段训练策略：监督微调引导认知轨迹，强化学习优化决策。

Result: ViTAR在广泛评估中优于现有最先进模型。视觉注意力分析显示，从"思考"到"重新思考"阶段，ViTAR逐渐将视觉基础锚定到临床关键区域，并在推理过程中保持对视觉标记的高注意力分配。

Conclusion: 将专家风格的迭代思维链嵌入视觉语言模型可以增强医学AI的性能和可信度，为改进医学AI系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为DREAM的深度伪造视频视觉真实性评估基准，包含多样化质量的深度伪造视频数据集、14万个人类标注的真实性评分和文本描述，以及对16种代表性真实性评估方法的全面评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前研究主要关注深度伪造检测的客观识别，但深度伪造的主观感知（特别是其计算建模和模拟）缺乏充分研究。视觉真实性评估对于评估深度伪造的质量和欺骗性具有重要意义。

Method: 构建DREAM基准，包括：1）多样化质量的深度伪造视频数据集；2）3500名标注者提供的14万个真实性评分和文本描述的大规模标注；3）评估16种代表性真实性评估方法，包括基于大视觉语言模型的方法和新提出的描述对齐CLIP方法。

Conclusion: DREAM基准为深度伪造视觉真实性评估这一新方向的研究提供了基础，通过大规模人类感知数据和多种评估方法的系统性分析，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly
proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included
in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and
other related areas.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CLSL方法解决多标签图像识别中标签不完整问题，通过语义感知特征学习和标签恢复的协同学习框架，在MS-COCO、VOC2007和NUS-WIDE数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签图像识别中标签不完整面临两个核心挑战：语义感知特征学习和缺失标签恢复，需要统一解决这两个问题。

Method: 设计语义相关特征学习模块学习鲁棒语义特征，提出语义引导特征增强模块生成高质量语义感知特征，并构建协同学习框架整合特征学习和标签恢复。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的公开数据集上实验表明，CLSL方法在标签不完整情况下优于现有最先进的多标签图像识别方法。

Conclusion: CLSL方法通过语义感知特征学习和标签恢复的协同学习，有效解决了多标签图像识别中标签不完整的问题，形成了两个过程的相互增强循环。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

*Pîrvu Mihai-Cristian,Leordeanu Marius*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PHG-MAE模型，将神经图理论与掩码自编码器结合，通过随机掩码整个模态来采样超边分布，统一了预训练和微调过程，并支持推理时集成和知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用自监督预训练方法（如MAE）无需人工标注数据的优势，解决多模态多任务学习场景下的模型训练问题，特别是在无人机户外场景中。

Method: 结合神经图和掩码自编码器，随机掩码整个模态而非仅图像块，在每个前向传播中采样超边分布，将预训练和微调统一到单个训练循环中。

Result: 模型支持推理时集成，通过聚合提升预测性能和一致性，并能在小参数模型（少于100万参数）上应用知识蒸馏且性能损失很小。

Conclusion: PHG-MAE为多模态多任务学习提供了统一框架，特别适用于无人机户外场景，也可扩展到自动驾驶和室内机器人等领域，并发布了相关数据集和工具。

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.
All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉基础模型的通用框架，用于追踪大规模滑坡疤痕的时空演化，通过将离散遥感图像重建为连续视频序列，实现滑坡演化过程的连续监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于单阶段或前后双阶段滑坡识别，难以追踪滑坡疤痕的时空演化过程，而这对理解演化机制和识别失稳前兆至关重要。

Method: 将离散光学遥感图像重建为连续视频序列，利用为视频分割开发的视觉基础模型，在知识引导、自动传播和交互精炼的范式下实现滑坡疤痕的连续准确识别。

Result: 在巴格滑坡和色拉滑坡两个代表性案例中验证了框架有效性，能够连续追踪滑坡疤痕，捕捉早期预警所需的失稳前兆和评估次生灾害所需的失稳后演化。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模滑坡疤痕的时空演化追踪提供了有效解决方案，在早期预警和长期稳定性评估方面具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

*Jiahui Lu,Haihong Xiao,Xueyan Zhao,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gesplat是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的框架，能够在无姿态稀疏图像下实现鲁棒的新视角合成和几何一致重建，通过VGGT基础模型获取可靠初始姿态和密集点云，结合混合高斯表示、图引导属性优化和流式深度正则化等创新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF和3DGS方法严重依赖准确的相机姿态和密集视角覆盖，这在稀疏视图设置中限制了应用，因为姿态估计不可靠且监督不足。

Method: 1) 使用VGGT基础模型获取初始姿态和密集点云；2) 结合位置-形状双重优化的混合高斯表示；3) 图引导属性优化模块增强场景细节；4) 流式深度正则化提升深度估计精度。

Result: 在正向视角和大规模复杂数据集上的综合定量和定性实验表明，该方法相比其他无姿态方法实现了更鲁棒的性能。

Conclusion: Gesplat框架有效解决了稀疏视图下3D重建和新视角合成的挑战，为无姿态稀疏图像场景提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

TL;DR: 首次将无监督联邦学习扩展到分类问题，提出FedCoPL方法，利用CLIP模型通过伪标签分布估计和调整来解决类别不平衡问题，并采用部分提示聚合协议实现有效协作和个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督联邦学习主要关注表示学习和聚类任务，而视觉语言模型（如CLIP）的零样本预测能力为分类问题提供了新机会，但在无监督联邦学习范式下尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出FedCoPL方法：客户端估计并上传伪标签分布，服务器调整并重新分发以避免全局类别不平衡；引入部分提示聚合协议，视觉提示在服务器聚合，文本提示在本地保留以实现个性化。

Result: 大量实验表明FedCoPL相比基线方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 成功将无监督联邦学习扩展到分类问题，提出的FedCoPL方法在保持数据隐私的同时实现了有效的分类性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ACRE方法，通过一致性检查增强强化学习，解决多模态LLM中推理链与最终答案不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RL方法虽然提高了答案准确性，但会导致推理过程与最终答案不一致，在MMVU基准上仅有79.7%的一致性。

Method: 修改GRPO算法，增加辅助一致性检查：在模型生成推理链和初始答案后，打乱选项顺序让模型基于相同推理重新预测，设计一致性验证奖励机制。

Result: 在视频推理和数学推理基准上分别比GRPO基线平均提升2.2%和1.5%。

Conclusion: ACRE方法能有效惩罚推理-答案不一致，减少模型对虚假模式（如选项顺序偏差）的依赖。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的后检测框架，通过统计不确定性和视觉特征重新调整检测置信度，提升紧凑型深度学习模型在火灾烟雾检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的火灾烟雾检测方法在效率和可靠性之间存在平衡问题，紧凑型深度学习模型（如YOLOv5n/YOLOv8n）在部署到无人机、CCTV和物联网设备时，常因容量减少导致误报和漏检。传统后检测方法仅依赖空间重叠，在复杂火灾场景中可能抑制真阳性或保留误报。

Method: 提出了一个不确定性感知的后检测框架，使用轻量级置信度精炼网络，将不确定性估计与颜色、边缘和纹理特征相结合来调整检测分数，无需修改基础模型。

Result: 在D-Fire数据集上的实验表明，相比现有基线方法，该方法在精度、召回率和平均精度方面均有提升，且计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 后检测重评分能有效增强紧凑型深度学习模型在实际火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

Conclusion: ICFC框架成功利用MLLM推理能力，实现了图像级分类、像素级定位和文本级可解释性的系统开发，为图像取证提供了有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

Result: 模型在区分五个严重程度类别方面表现出色，证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: 结合时空表示和注意力机制可以改进自动帕金森病严重程度检测，为临床监测和进展跟踪提供有前景的无创工具

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

*Halil Hüseyin Çalışkan,Talha Koruk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepFusionNet是一种轻量级架构，用于低光图像增强和超分辨率任务，相比传统方法参数更少但性能更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像增强和超分辨率任务中传统方法参数多、计算量大且SSIM和PSNR分数低的问题。

Method: 基于DeepFusionNet架构，使用轻量级设计，参数数量大幅减少（低光增强约250万参数，超分辨率约10万参数）。

Result: 在LOL-v1数据集上，低光增强达到SSIM 92.8%和PSNR 26.30；超分辨率达到PSNR 25.30和SSIM 80.7%。

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet在保持高性能的同时显著减少了参数数量，为实时图像处理应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time
detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of
YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,
showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

*Yecong Wan,Mingwen Shao,Renlong Wu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Color3D是一个用于静态和动态3D场景着色的灵活框架，通过个性化着色器将单张关键视图的颜色传播到新视角和时间步，确保跨视图和时间的一致性，同时保持颜色多样性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注静态场景，通过平均颜色变化来强制多视图一致性，但这牺牲了色彩丰富性和可控性。Color3D旨在解决这一问题，在保持色彩多样性和可控性的同时确保一致性。

Method: 核心思路是仅对单个关键视图进行着色，然后微调个性化着色器，通过其固有的归纳偏置将颜色传播到新视角和视频帧。使用Lab色彩空间的Gaussian splatting表示直接重建彩色3D场景。

Result: 在多样化的静态和动态3D着色基准测试中，该方法能够提供更一致和色彩丰富的渲染结果，并具有精确的用户控制能力。

Conclusion: 该框架巧妙地将复杂的3D着色问题转化为更易处理的单图像范式，允许无缝集成任意图像着色模型，增强了灵活性和可控性。

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

Abstract: A key challenge in ischemic stroke diagnosis using medical imaging is the
accurate localization of the occluded vessel. Current machine learning methods
in focus primarily on lesion segmentation, with limited work on vessel
localization. In this study, we introduce Stroke Locus Net, an end-to-end deep
learning pipeline for detection, segmentation, and occluded vessel localization
using only MRI scans. The proposed system combines a segmentation branch using
nnUNet for lesion detection with an arterial atlas for vessel mapping and
identification, and a generation branch using pGAN to synthesize MRA images
from MRI. Our implementation demonstrates promising results in localizing
occluded vessels on stroke-affected T1 MRI scans, with potential for faster and
more informed stroke diagnosis.

Motivation: 现有的大规模文本到图像扩散模型在角色一致性生成和编辑方面存在局限：生成方法难以保持细粒度身份一致性，编辑方法则容易失去空间可控性和指令对齐。

Method: ReMix模块利用MLLM的多模态推理能力编辑输入图像的语义特征并适配指令嵌入；IP-ControlNet扩展ControlNet，解耦参考图像的语义和布局线索，在共享噪声空间中联合去噪参考图像和目标图像。

Conclusion: ReMix成功地将角色一致性生成和编辑统一在一个框架内，解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了更好的身份保持和空间控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RIS方法主要处理简单表达，无法有效应对现实世界中具有歧义的指称表达，特别是对象干扰表达和类别隐式表达。

Method: SaFiRe框架模拟人类两阶段认知过程：先形成全局理解，再通过细节导向检查进行精炼，利用Mamba的扫描-更新特性实现高效多周期精炼。

Result: 在标准和提出的数据集上的广泛实验表明，SaFiRe在歧义指称表达下优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: SaFiRe通过两阶段认知建模有效解决了RIS中的歧义表达问题，为处理复杂现实场景提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 水下生态监测需要语义分割，但获取密集专家标注成本高昂，而稀疏点标注更容易获得但面临标注点选择和信息传播的挑战。

Method: 采用主动采样策略指导标注者选择最有价值的点，然后结合SAM2和超像素方法的混合方法传播稀疏标签。

Result: 在两个不同的水下数据集上测试，比最先进方法D+NN提升高达5% mIoU。

Conclusion: 开发并发布了简单有效的交互式标注工具，使生态研究人员能够利用基础模型和计算机视觉高效生成高质量分割掩码。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念模型将概念视为数值属性，缺乏能够定位预测概念的视觉解释，限制了在医疗等高风险场景中的实用性。

Method: 提出基于transformer的框架，引入多概念可学习token，利用专门的注意力层处理视觉和文本概念token，生成概念级定位图。

Result: 在合成和真实医学数据集上的实验表明，ViConEx-Med在概念检测和定位精度方面优于现有概念模型，与黑盒模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建基于视觉概念的内在可解释模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 通过利用物体的完整表面和内部信息创建超密集对应关系，结合高效的分层连续坐标编码，可以显著提高姿态估计的准确性。

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸性别分类模型经常反映并放大训练数据中的人口统计偏见，导致在不同性别和种族亚组中表现不均。需要一种简单有效的方法来缓解这种偏见。

Method: 伪平衡策略，在伪标签选择过程中强制人口统计平衡，仅使用来自种族平衡数据集的未标记图像，无需访问真实标注。通过微调有偏见的性别分类器和在故意不平衡的训练数据上进行压力测试来评估。

Result: 伪平衡方法在保持或提高准确性的同时持续改善公平性。总体准确率达到79.81%，比基线提高6.53%，性别准确率差距减少44.17%。在东亚亚组中，基线差异超过49%，差距缩小到仅5.01%。

Conclusion: 即使在没有标签监督的情况下，访问人口统计平衡或适度倾斜的未标记数据集也可以作为消除现有计算机视觉模型偏见的有力资源。

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

Result: 在ReferIt3D和ScanRefer基准测试中优于现有最优方法，证明了n元关系感知在3D定位中的优势。

Conclusion: n元关系学习能有效提升3D物体定位性能，特别是在处理涉及多个空间关系的复杂描述时。

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

TL;DR: 提出了一种量化自动驾驶系统中合成数据与真实数据差距的系统框架，并引入了SEDD作为新的评估指标，通过风格嵌入分布差异来评估合成数据集的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶感知系统需要大量环境测试，但真实世界测试不切实际。合成数据集虽然成本低且无偏见，但与真实数据存在领域差距，量化这种差距对评估数据集效用和设计训练流程至关重要。

Method: 结合Gram矩阵风格提取和度量学习，优化类内紧凑性和类间分离性来提取风格嵌入，建立系统框架量化合成到真实的差距。

Result: 在多个数据集和仿真到真实方法上的实验表明，该方法能够有效量化合成到真实的差距。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个标准化的质量控制工具，能够系统诊断和针对性增强合成数据集，推动数据驱动自动驾驶系统的未来发展。

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: 提出了AnomReason基准和AnomAgent标注流程，用于检测AI生成图像中的语义异常，并通过微调模型在语义匹配指标上取得改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像常存在语义异常（如不合理的物体配置、违反物理定律或常识不一致），影响可信度，需要检测这些语义级异常来评估AIGC媒体的可信度。

Method: 构建大规模基准AnomReason，采用结构化四元组标注（名称、现象、推理、严重程度），通过多智能体流程AnomAgent进行标注，结合轻量级人工验证。

Result: 处理了约4.17B GPT-4o tokens，微调模型在语义匹配指标（SemAP和SemF1）上优于强视觉语言基线，应用于可解释深度伪造检测和图像生成器语义合理性评估。

Conclusion: AnomReason和AnomAgent为测量和改进AI生成图像的语义合理性提供了基础，支持语义真实性和可解释AIGC取证的可复现研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

TL;DR: 大型视觉模型在零样本设置下直接应用于医学影像任务，无需医学数据训练就能在器官分割、去噪、超分辨率和运动预测等任务中取得竞争性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大型生成模型在跨领域零样本泛化能力的启发，研究是否可以将自回归视频建模原理直接应用于医学影像任务。

Method: 在零样本设置下评估大型视觉模型在四个代表性医学影像任务上的表现：器官分割、去噪、超分辨率和放疗运动预测。

Result: 模型能够描绘CT扫描中的解剖结构，在分割、去噪和超分辨率任务中表现竞争性。在放疗运动预测中，模型直接从4D CT扫描的先前阶段预测未来3D CT阶段，产生解剖学一致且具有真实时间一致性的预测。在122名患者的4D CT数据上评估，模型在所有任务中表现强劲，在运动预测中超越了专门的DVF基线和生成基线，达到最先进的空间精度。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了医学视频建模中零样本能力的出现，突显了通用视频模型作为统一学习器和推理器的潜力，为基于视频模型的未来医学基础模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

TL;DR: 提出一个改进3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景下效率的框架，通过新的致密化触发机制和保守剪枝策略，显著减少基元数量同时保持重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景中的过拟合和重建膨胀问题，现有方法虽然提升质量但大幅增加基元数量，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 用基于不透明度梯度的新致密化触发机制替代标准位置梯度启发式，结合保守剪枝策略防止破坏性优化循环，并使用标准深度相关性损失提供几何指导

Result: 在3视图LLFF数据集上比FSGS紧凑40%以上（32k vs 57k基元），在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上减少约70%基元，在质量与效率的帕累托前沿达到新SOTA

Conclusion: 该框架通过重新设计核心优化策略，在少样本视图合成中实现了质量与效率的根本性改进，建立了新的效率标准

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

Motivation: 现有音频和姿态驱动的人体动画方法存在头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题，主要原因是音频与头部运动相关性弱，以及手部结构复杂。

Method: 1. 预训练手部清晰度码本(HCC)编码高保真手部纹理先验；2. 设计双流音频感知模块(DSAA)分别建模唇部同步和自然头部姿态动态；3. 引入姿态校准技巧(PCT)通过放松刚性约束来精炼和对齐姿态条件。

Result: 大量实验表明VividAnimator达到最先进性能，生成具有优越手部细节、手势真实性和身份一致性的视频，通过定量指标和定性评估验证。

Conclusion: 该框架通过三个关键创新有效解决了音频和姿态驱动动画中的头部僵硬和手部模糊问题，实现了高质量的人体动画生成。

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进方法通常只依赖透视视图或鸟瞰图特征，无法同时利用细粒度物体细节和空间结构化场景表示，限制了3D物体检测和跟踪的性能。

Method: 提出混合检测跟踪框架，结合PV和BEV相机图像特征；引入基础模型引导的BEV地图，通过新颖蒸馏过程将描述性DINOv2特征蒸馏到BEV表示中；通过可变形聚合集成PV特征和富含DINOv2语义几何特征的BEV地图。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DualViewDistill实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 结果展示了基础模型BEV地图在实现更可靠自动驾驶感知方面的潜力。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained
models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

Motivation: SAM2虽然在低资源环境下能够实现快速推理，但其微调仍然具有挑战性，特别是在跨数据集眼底分割任务中。

Method: 在SAM2的图像编码器和掩码解码器中集成低秩适配器，并使用结合分割BCE、SoftDice和FocalTversky损失的复合损失函数进行网络调优。

Result: 在11个具有挑战性的眼底分割数据集上评估，SAM2LoRA在跨数据集训练条件下，在血管和视盘分割方面表现出高性能，Dice分数分别达到0.86和0.93，AUC值分别达到0.98和0.99。

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA在显著减少训练开销的同时，实现了最先进的性能，为眼底图像分割提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

Motivation: 现实世界场景（如ScanNet）捕获困难且数据有限，生成具有多样化物体姿态的真实场景仍然是一个开放且具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 引入分解表示法将场景分解为层次化组织的房间程序和物体姿态概念；学习可重用布局模式的函数库；使用大语言模型生成高级程序；学习程序条件模型来层次化预测物体姿态。

Result: FactoredScenes生成了难以与真实ScanNet场景区分的逼真现实世界房间。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分解场景表示和程序化生成方法，能够有效合成真实且多样化的3D室内场景。

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an
ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling
semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance
interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate

Result: 实验验证显示最低重叠率要求降低了20%

Conclusion: Ortho-Fuse框架能够生成可靠的正射影像，同时降低重叠率要求，有助于促进AI驱动监测系统在精准农业中的集成应用

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

Motivation: 现有模型依赖训练时学到的归纳偏置进行静态推理，难以适应测试时的新结构模式和传感器引起的失真。

Method: 使用基于MAML的元辅助学习策略，通过两个自监督辅助目标优化补全模型，并在推理时通过优化辅助损失自适应共享编码器，同时引入自适应λ校准机制来平衡主任务和辅助任务的梯度。

Conclusion: 这是首个将元辅助测试时自适应应用于点云补全的工作，能够有效适应新结构模式和传感器失真。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

### [79] [Identifying bias in CNN image classification using image scrambling and transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10383)
*Sai Teja Erukude*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文讨论了CNN中的隐藏偏见问题，提出了通过图像分块和图像变换的方法来区分上下文信息和背景噪声，有效识别数据集偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN作为黑盒模型难以解释其决策过程，容易受到背景信息的偏见影响，需要开发方法来识别这些隐藏偏见。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）将图像分割成随机打乱的非重叠小块；2）应用傅里叶变换、小波变换和中值滤波器等图像变换技术来恢复背景噪声信息。

Result: 在六个不同数据集上的测试表明，该方法能有效区分上下文信息和背景噪声，即使在没有背景信息的情况下也能检测到背景噪声的存在。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效识别CNN中的数据集偏见，帮助区分学习到的特征是否相关，为理解CNN决策过程提供了实用工具。

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh-Gait是一个新颖的多模态步态识别框架，通过从2D轮廓直接重建3D热图作为中间表示，有效结合了2D轮廓和3D几何信息的优势，在保持计算效率的同时实现了最先进的识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于2D轮廓或骨架的步态识别方法容易受到视角变化、遮挡和噪声的影响，而现有的多模态方法虽然结合了3D身体形状信息但计算成本高昂，难以应用于实时场景。

Method: 提出Mesh-Gait框架，通过从2D轮廓重建3D热图作为中间表示，在监督学习下逐步重建准确的3D关节、虚拟标记和网格，同时从轮廓和重建的3D热图中提取判别性特征。

Result: 大量实验表明Mesh-Gait达到了最先进的识别精度，同时避免了从RGB视频直接进行3D重建的沉重计算开销。

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait通过创新的3D热图中间表示，成功结合了2D和3D模态的优势，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了步态识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合特征空间顺序和渐进式匹配的图像特征匹配方法，通过空间顺序模型和极线几何共同指导特征匹配，提高匹配效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像特征匹配方法在处理大量特征点时耗时严重，特征空间顺序作为独立于极线几何的概念，可以补充指导特征匹配，提高效率。

Method: 将特征空间顺序整合到渐进式匹配框架中，利用初始匹配特征构建空间顺序模型，计算后续特征匹配的可能空间范围，过滤不必要的匹配，并与极线几何结合。提出基于基础矩阵的图像对齐方法来消除图像旋转对特征空间顺序的影响。

Result: 在标准基准数据集、自生成模拟图像和真实图像上的实验表明，该方法比传统方法显著更高效，且特征匹配更准确。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过整合特征空间顺序和极线几何，在保持匹配准确性的同时显著提高了匹配效率，证明了特征空间顺序在指导特征匹配中的有效性。

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前步态识别方法通常只关注2D或3D单一模态，无法充分捕捉人类行走模式的几何和动态复杂性。

Method: 使用统一transformer融合多模态步态特征，采用多任务学习策略同时进行步态识别和年龄、BMI、性别等人体属性估计。

Result: 在BRIAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在步态识别方面优于现有方法，并能提供准确的人体属性估计。

Conclusion: 多模态和多任务学习在真实场景中推进基于步态的人类理解具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VR技术的快速发展，晕动症问题严重阻碍了其广泛应用。现有研究多关注多模态传感器数据，但对基于视频特征的预测研究有限。

Method: 采用迁移学习方法，使用在ImageNet上预训练的InceptionV3模型从VR游戏视频中提取高级视觉特征，然后通过LSTM网络捕捉时间动态并预测晕动症严重程度。

Result: 该方法在晕动症严重程度分类任务上达到了68.4%的准确率，超越了仅使用视频数据的现有模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为VR开发者提供了评估和缓解晕动症的有效工具，并为基于视频时序建模的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuLiRAG是一个人类式检索增强生成框架，通过"什么-哪里-重加权"级联方法解决MLLMs在细粒度视觉问答中的幻觉问题，提升定位保真度和事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中经常产生关于物体身份、位置和关系的幻觉，因为文本查询没有明确锚定到视觉参照物。现有RAG方法缺乏局部细节和对细粒度交互的推理能力。

Method: 采用"什么-哪里-重加权"级联：通过开放词汇检测锚定候选参照物（什么），用SAM衍生掩码进行空间解析恢复细粒度精度（哪里），通过局部与全局对齐的权衡自适应优先排序（重加权）。掩码引导微调将空间证据注入生成过程。

Result: 广泛实验表明，这种人类式级联提高了定位保真度和事实一致性，同时减少了幻觉，推动了多模态问答向可信推理发展。

Conclusion: HuLiRAG框架通过模拟人类推理过程，将定位从被动偏置转变为答案制定的显式约束，显著提升了多模态问答的可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion是一个单目SE(3)扩散框架，通过条件去噪扩散过程进行无标记、基于图像的机器人姿态估计，在DREAM和RoboKeyGen基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法使用固定尺度扰动，限制了训练姿态的多样性和网络泛化能力。需要一种能够生成视场内多样化训练姿态的方法，并提高姿态估计的鲁棒性。

Method: 框架包含两个过程：可见性约束扩散过程用于多样化姿态增强，时间步感知反向过程用于渐进姿态细化。扩散过程将真实姿态逐步扰动为噪声变换，反向过程通过去噪网络迭代预测和细化姿态。

Result: 在两个基准测试(DREAM和RoboKeyGen)上均取得改进，在最具挑战性的数据集上达到66.75的AUC，比现有最佳方法提升32.3%。

Conclusion: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion通过扩散过程生成多样化训练姿态，通过时间步感知反向过程实现渐进姿态细化，显著提升了单目机器人姿态估计的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有基于表示的方法在处理一致性异常（跨多个图像重复出现的相似缺陷）时表现不佳，导致异常分类和分割性能下降。

Method: CoDeGraph构建图像级图结构，以图像为节点，通过共享一致性异常模式连接边，利用社区检测过滤异常。基于极值理论提供理论支撑。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ViT-L-14-336骨干网络达到98.3% AUROC异常分类性能，分割性能F1得分66.8%（提升4.2%），AP 68.1%（提升5.4%）。使用DINOv2骨干网络进一步提升分割性能至69.1% F1和71.9% AP。

Conclusion: CoDeGraph能有效检测和过滤一致性异常，在不同骨干网络架构下均表现出鲁棒性，为零样本异常检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

Conclusion: 通过将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声，为构建更稳健可信的医疗AI系统提供了清晰路径。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型(VLMs)存在严重幻觉问题，倾向于生成与图像无关但语言流畅的响应，主要原因是语言偏见。

Method: 在解码过程中自适应地屏蔽关键图像token的注意力权重，通过降解视觉-语言感知来强调视觉上下文，减少语言偏见。

Result: CMG在幻觉特定基准测试中显著提升不同VLM的性能，且能有效泛化，无需额外条件或训练成本。

Conclusion: CMG是一种有效的训练自由解码方法，能显著减少VLM中的幻觉问题，同时保持模型能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

TL;DR: 提出DAGLFNet框架，通过全局-局部特征融合编码、多分支特征提取和深度特征引导注意力机制，提升LiDAR点云语义分割的判别性特征提取能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伪图像表示方法在处理非结构化点云时往往忽略点云的结构和语义细节，导致特征融合和判别能力有限

Method: 1. 全局-局部特征融合编码模块增强局部特征相关性和全局上下文信息；2. 多分支特征提取网络捕获更多邻域信息并增强轮廓特征判别性；3. 深度特征引导注意力机制提升跨通道特征融合精度

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和nuScenes验证集上分别达到69.83%和78.65%的准确率，平衡了高性能与实时性

Conclusion: DAGLFNet在LiDAR点云语义分割中表现出色，具有实时应用潜力

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MSF-Mamba模型，通过融合局部上下文状态来增强Mamba的局部时空建模能力，解决了微手势识别中长程依赖和局部模式捕获的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在微手势识别中存在局限性：CNN难以捕获长程依赖，Transformer计算成本高，而Mamba虽然效率高但缺乏局部时空建模能力。需要一种能同时有效处理长程和局部依赖的模型。

Method: 提出MSF-Mamba，基于中心帧差分的运动感知状态融合模块，增强Mamba的局部时空建模。还提出多尺度版本MSF-Mamba+，支持多尺度运动感知状态融合和自适应尺度加权。

Result: 在两个公共微手势识别数据集上的实验表明，即使是轻量级版本MSF-Mamba也能达到最先进性能，优于现有的CNN、Transformer和SSM模型，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: MSF-Mamba通过运动感知状态融合有效解决了Mamba在局部时空建模方面的局限性，为微手势识别提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文验证了视觉语言模型(VLMs)具有内在的自我精炼能力，能够无需外部监督自主生成高质量的训练数据。作者提出了基于三角一致性原则的自精炼框架，通过三个步骤实现模型的自主学习和改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在无监督指令训练下的潜力，验证其是否具备自我精炼能力，从而摆脱对外部监督数据的依赖。

Method: 提出基于三角一致性原则的自精炼框架：1)通过多任务指令调优激活指令生成能力；2)从未标记图像生成图像-查询-答案三元组并用三角一致性原则过滤；3)使用过滤后的合成数据更新模型。

Result: 以LLaVA-1.5为基线，实验表明模型能够在无任何外部监督的情况下，在多个基准测试中实现一致且适度的改进。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型确实具备自我精炼能力，这一发现可为未来研究VLMs学习机制提供启发。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

TL;DR: HARoPE是一种针对图像生成任务的改进型旋转位置编码方法，通过可学习的线性变换动态调整频率分配和旋转平面对齐，解决了标准RoPE在图像生成中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的多维RoPE在图像生成中存在三个关键限制：刚性频率分配、轴间独立性和统一头处理，导致在细粒度空间关系建模、颜色线索和物体计数方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出HARoPE，在旋转映射前插入一个通过奇异值分解参数化的可学习线性变换，实现动态频率重分配、旋转平面对齐和头特定的位置感受野，同时严格保持RoPE的相对位置属性。

Result: 在类条件ImageNet和文生图任务（Flux和MMDiT）上的广泛实验表明，HARoPE始终优于强RoPE基线和其他扩展方法。

Conclusion: HARoPE可作为即插即用的替代方案，为基于Transformer的图像生成模型提供原则性且可适应的位置感知增强解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable
solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image
generative models.

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D是一个基于多视角扩散模型的3D风格迁移方法，通过拼图操作解耦风格与语义内容，实现快速、视角一致的3D资产风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D风格迁移方法存在两个主要问题：依赖直接参考风格标记注入或2D扩散模型的分数蒸馏，这导致沉重的逐场景优化成本，且经常将风格与语义内容纠缠在一起。

Method: 使用拼图操作（空间打乱和随机掩码参考图像块）来抑制对象语义并分离风格统计信息（调色板、笔触、纹理），通过参考到视角的交叉注意力将这些风格线索集成到多视角扩散模型中。

Result: 在标准3D风格化基准测试中，Jigsaw3D实现了高风格保真度和多视角一致性，延迟显著降低，并能泛化到掩码部分参考风格化、多对象场景风格化和可平铺纹理生成。

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D通过解耦风格与内容的方法，为3D风格迁移提供了一种高效且一致的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: VR-Thinker是一个思考式图像框架，通过视觉推理操作和可配置视觉记忆窗口，让奖励模型能够主动获取和更新视觉证据，在上下文限制内提高推理保真度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态奖励模型面临两个固有局限：(1)视觉输入消耗大量上下文预算，导致帧数减少和细粒度细节丢失；(2)所有视觉信息都打包到初始提示中，加剧了思维链推理中的幻觉和遗忘问题。

Method: 采用强化微调流程：首先用精心策划的视觉思维链数据进行冷启动，蒸馏基本推理技能和操作格式化；然后选择所有维度判断都正确的样本进行拒绝采样微调；最后应用组相对策略优化来加强推理。

Result: 在视频偏好基准测试中达到最先进精度，特别是在长视频上：7B VR-Thinker在VideoGen Reward上达到80.5%，GenAI-Bench上82.3%，MJ-Bench-Video上75.6%。

Conclusion: 结果验证了思考式图像多模态奖励建模的有效性和前景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LUT方法由于表大小组合爆炸问题，导致卷积核感受野受限，影响了CNN推理性能。本研究旨在在固定表大小下扩展CNN感受野。

Method: 1. 学习最优格点向量量化器，根据数据维度重要性自适应分配量化分辨率；2. 引入不规则空洞卷积；3. 设计U形级联LUT结构捕获多级上下文信息。

Result: 该方法在速度、精度和内存效率之间取得良好平衡，相比现有LUT方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过格点向量量化器和感受野扩展策略，有效解决了LUT方法感受野受限的问题，实现了更高效的CNN快速推理。

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Motivation: 解决以往开放词汇分割和上下文分割方法在架构差异、学习目标和表征学习策略上的不一致问题，构建统一的模型来处理不同粒度的分割任务。

Method: 利用基础模型提取输入图像和多模态提示的表征，使用SegDecoder对齐这些表征、建模它们的交互，并根据输入提示获取不同粒度的掩码。

Result: 综合实验表明，COSINE在开放词汇分割和上下文分割任务上都有显著的性能提升。探索性分析显示，视觉和文本提示的协同合作比单模态方法有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: COSINE成功统一了开放词汇分割和上下文分割，通过多模态提示的协同作用实现了更好的泛化性能，为开世界分割提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal
prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their
interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different
granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies,
divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate
recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts
and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that
integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language
modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character
identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis
within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for
enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance
applications.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Motivation: 多模态学习中模态缺失不平衡导致恶性循环：缺失率高的模态更新少，学习进度不一致，表示质量下降，进一步削弱其贡献

Result: 在四个多模态基准测试上的综合评估表明，MCE在各种缺失配置下始终优于最先进方法

Conclusion: MCE通过动态平衡学习进度和增强特征表示，有效解决了多模态学习中的模态缺失不平衡问题

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with

with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection
efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway
environment, we proposed an improved algorithm MRS-YOLO based on YOLO11.
Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point
Operations Per Second (GFLOPs), and improve the detection efficiency. The
experimental results show that the mAP50 and mAP50:95 of the MRS-YOLO algorithm
proposed in this paper are improved to 94.8% and 86.4%, respectively, which are
0.7 and 2.3 percentage points higher compared to the baseline, while Parameters
and GFLOPs are reduced by 44.2% and 17.5%, respectively. It is demonstrated
that the improved algorithm can be better applied to the task of foreign object
detection in railroad transmission lines.

Method: 将现有图像到视频迁移学习策略分为两类：冻结特征（保持ILFM原始表示）和修改特征（对原始表示进行修改）。系统阐述了这些策略在从细粒度（时空视频定位）到粗粒度（视频问答）等各种视频文本学习任务中的应用。

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep
auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and
inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of
our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning
models. Furthermore, we carried out ablation studies for an extended analysis
of our proposed joint learning strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像合成质量受到颜色衰减和浑浊等光学现象影响，这些现象在不同水域表现为不同的风格变化。现有生成模型难以建模多样化水下环境的非均匀条件。

Method: 使用K-means聚类将数据集划分为风格特定域，采用分离的编码器获取风格和内容的潜在空间，通过AdaIN整合潜在表示并解码生成最终合成图像，在每个风格聚类上独立训练以保持域特定特征。

Conclusion: DISC-GAN通过风格-内容解耦和聚类特定训练策略，成功解决了水下图像合成的挑战，实现了高质量的合成结果。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFlow是一个通用的统一视觉分词器，通过层自适应自蒸馏和轻量级像素流解码器，解决了视觉理解与生成之间的性能权衡问题，在13个基准测试中实现了双赢结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一分词器在视觉理解与生成之间存在显著性能权衡，源于高层语义抽象与低层像素重建之间的内在冲突。

Method: 提出UniFlow统一分词器：1）对预训练视觉编码器应用层自适应自蒸馏，继承强语义特征并适应细粒度细节；2）设计轻量级补丁像素流解码器，通过条件流建模实现高保真像素重建；3）使用语义特征作为视觉条件缓解训练冲突。

Conclusion: UniFlow通过创新的自适应蒸馏和像素流解码器设计，成功解决了视觉理解与生成之间的冲突，实现了统一分词器的双赢性能。

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world

TL;DR: 提出Diff-ABFlow框架，基于扩散模型和帧-事件外观-边界融合，解决高速和低光场景下光流估计的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光流估计在高速和低光场景中面临运动模糊和光照不足的问题，导致纹理减弱、噪声放大，影响外观饱和度和边界完整性。事件相机虽然外观稀疏但边界完整，传统方法未能充分利用这一优势。

Method: 采用扩散模型学习从噪声流到清晰流的映射，不受退化视觉特征影响，结合帧相机的外观饱和度和事件相机的边界完整性进行融合。

Result: 提出的Diff-ABFlow框架能够有效处理高速和低光场景下的光流估计问题。

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的帧-事件外观-边界融合方法为退化场景下的光流估计提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在提高胸部X射线诊断准确性的同时，可能在不同人口统计群体间表现不一，从而加剧医疗保健差距。

Method: 扩展CNN-XGBoost管道支持多标签分类，用XGBoost替换CNN最后一层，并在DenseNet-121和ResNet-50等不同骨干网络上验证方法。

Result: 该方法在保持或提高整体预测性能的同时改善了子群体公平性，与对抗训练、重加权等传统方法相比，以更低的计算成本实现了竞争性或更优的偏见减少。

Conclusion: XGBoost重训练与主动学习结合在所有人口统计子群体中实现了最大的偏见减少，为临床放射学中公平深度学习部署提供了实用有效路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

Motivation: 预训练视觉基础模型在OOD检测中的潜力尚未充分探索，尽管它们具有学习判别性和泛化性特征的能力。

Method: 1) 评估预训练基础模型的OOD检测能力；2) 提出MoFE模块分割特征子空间；3) 引入Dynamic-β Mixup策略自适应调整插值权重。

Result: DINOv2模型无需微调即可达到SOTA性能。提出的方法在大语义空间场景中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉基础模型是OOD检测的强大工具，通过MoFE和Dynamic-β Mixup策略可以进一步提升其在大语义空间中的性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

Motivation: 现有的多语言视觉语言模型存在英语偏向问题，且只关注实例级对齐而忽略了共享嵌入空间的全局几何结构

Method: 提出拓扑对齐损失函数，使用持久同调定义拓扑约束，并通过图稀疏化策略近似持久图，具有理论误差界

Result: 在多语言表示中增强了结构一致性，在CIFAR-100上获得更高的零样本准确率，在xFlickr&CO上实现更强的多语言检索性能

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了多语言视觉语言模型的性能，还为表示学习中的拓扑对齐提供了一般性方法

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

Conclusion: FSVG是一种简单而有效的视觉定位基线方法，通过特征选择机制实现了精度和效率的良好平衡

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection
mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster
prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets
comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统SFT方法性能次优，而RLVR在处理超出模型知识库的任务时存在困难。需要一种能结合两者优势的统一方法来解决这些局限性。

Conclusion: 深入分析验证了ViSurf的推导和设计原则，证明其作为统一后训练范式的有效性。

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we

TL;DR: FG-CLIP 2是一个双语视觉语言模型，通过细粒度监督和多种判别目标，在英语和中文上实现了先进的细粒度对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在非英语环境下的细粒度视觉语言理解能力有限，特别是在对象属性、空间关系和语言表达的细粒度对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 采用区域-文本匹配、长文本建模和多种判别目标，引入文本模态内对比损失来区分语义相似的描述，并在大规模英中双语数据上训练。

Result: 在29个数据集和8个任务上的广泛实验表明，FG-CLIP 2在两种语言上都超越了现有方法，取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2显著提升了双语细粒度对齐能力，并发布了新的中文多模态理解基准，为未来研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

TL;DR: OmniQuality-R是一个统一的质量奖励建模框架，将多任务质量推理转化为连续可解释的奖励信号，用于策略优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉评估方法通常局限于单一任务，需要解决多任务质量评估的统一框架问题。

Method: 构建推理增强的奖励建模数据集，通过拒绝采样获取信息丰富的计划-推理轨迹，形成可靠的思维链数据集用于监督微调，然后应用组相对策略优化进行后训练，并使用基于高斯的奖励支持连续分数预测。

Result: 在三个关键图像质量评估任务上进行了评估：美学质量评估、技术质量评估和图文对齐。

Conclusion: 通过标准差过滤和熵门控机制稳定训练并提高下游泛化能力，抑制不稳定更新并减少策略优化中的方差。

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at
https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性注意力模型由于低秩投影结构和过于均匀的注意力分布，导致表达能力显著下降，限制了节点表示的分类能力。

Method: 1) 在值矩阵上附加门控局部图网络分支以提升注意力图秩；2) 在注意力分数中引入可学习的对数幂函数来降低熵并锐化注意力分布。

Result: 在多种同质性和异质性图基准测试中，该方法在保持线性注意力可扩展性的同时实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合框架有效解决了线性注意力的表达能力限制问题，通过提升秩和锐化注意力分布来增强节点表示的可分离性。

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

TL;DR: 提出GeoVLMath模型，通过文本描述辅助线构造来增强大视觉语言模型在几何问题中的表现，使用强化学习框架提升图文对齐精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辅助线对解决复杂几何问题至关重要，但现有大视觉语言模型难以处理。直接编辑图表绘制辅助线存在几何精度问题，因此转向生成文本描述来更好地利用模型优势。

Method: 提出强化学习框架，核心是跨模态奖励机制，评估生成的辅助线描述与真实辅助线图表的匹配程度。基于此开发GeoVLMath模型，采用GRPO强化学习实现精确的图文对齐。构建AuxSolidMath数据集支持训练。

Result: 在3B和7B规模上，GeoVLMath在辅助线推理基准测试中表现优异，与强大的开源和专有LVLM相比具有竞争力甚至更优。

Conclusion: 通过文本描述辅助线构造和强化学习框架，成功提升了LVLM在几何问题中的表现，为复杂几何推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFOD方法主要针对传统检测模型如Faster R-CNN，缺乏对DETR等新型检测架构的专门适配，需要为DETR设计专门的源自由目标检测解决方案。

Method: 包含四个核心模块：OSSR基于目标性分数重加权检测损失；CMMB集成多级特征到记忆库增强对比学习；UQFD通过不确定性加权和查询特征融合改进特征蒸馏；DTUI优化自训练流程。

Result: 在多个广泛使用的基准测试中，FRANCK实现了最先进的性能，证明了其在DETR基SFOD模型中的有效性和兼容性。

Conclusion: FRANCK通过查询中心特征增强，有效将源预训练的DETR模型适配到目标域，具有增强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

Result: 方法统一了现有场景角点案例分类法，在角点案例检测任务中表现优异，并能分析组合角点案例。

Conclusion: 为角点案例识别提供了原则性基础，验证了无需手动规范的定义方法。

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,
underlining our manual specification-free definition.

Conclusion: 提出的结合文本注释的全景符号检测框架能够更全面地理解CAD图纸，通过联合建模几何和文本信息以及显式关系建模，显著提升了符号检测性能。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

Method: 提出了包含存在稳定性、定位稳定性和形状稳定性的多维度评估框架，使用新颖的稳定性指标并整合为统一的平均稳定性评分(mAS)。

Result: 在42个模型和变体上的实验表明，准确性(mAP)和稳定性(mAS)代表了相对独立的性能维度，并识别了影响这两个标准的模型设计关键因素。

Conclusion: 时间稳定性应与准确性一起作为核心评估标准，这项工作推动了更可靠自动驾驶系统的发展，并发布了公开基准以促进稳定性研究。

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at
https://stablehdmap.github.io/.

TL;DR: video-SALMONN S是首个能在固定内存预算下处理3小时视频（1FPS，360p）的流式视听LLM，通过测试时训练记忆模块和提示相关记忆读取器实现长视频理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解LLM难以扩展处理长视频流，离线方法需要调整帧率，流式方法会丢失信息。需要开发能在固定内存下连续处理长视频的方法。

Method: 引入测试时训练(TTT)记忆模块持续更新token表示，使用Hessian-free共轭梯度优化；设计提示相关记忆读取器选择性检索上下文相关内容。

Result: 在长视频基准测试中，8B参数模型在10k帧、100万token的多小时视频上保持高质量理解，Video-MME长分割达到67.8%，总体74.2%，优于离线和流式基线。

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S证明了在固定内存预算下处理极长视频流的可行性，为未来AI代理的连续视频处理提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

Motivation: 千亿级病理基础模型虽然性能优异，但由于计算成本过高难以实际应用。需要找到一种参数和数据高效的方法来达到类似性能。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏技术，将千亿级教师模型的能力转移到参数少得多的大型学生模型上，仅需目标癌症的1000张病理切片进行蒸馏训练。

Conclusion: 该蒸馏方法是一种参数和数据高效的方式，能够在癌症特定应用中实现千亿级性能，而无需承担过高的计算负担。

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

Motivation: 受文本到视频模型在模拟真实世界几何和物理规律方面强大能力的启发，探索利用视频生成先验从给定4D场景进行视点规划的可行性，因为视频内部伴随自然视点的动态场景。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于现有竞争对手，消融研究验证了关键技术设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作在一定程度上证明了视频生成模型在现实世界4D交互方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a

true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool

Abstract: Sign languages serve as essential communication systems for individuals with
hearing and speech impairments. However, digital linguistic dataset resources
for underrepresented sign languages, such as Nepali Sign Language (NSL), remain
scarce. This study introduces the first benchmark dataset for NSL, consisting
of 36 gesture classes with 1,500 samples per class, designed to capture the
structural and visual features of the language. To evaluate recognition
performance, we fine-tuned MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 architectures on the

TL;DR: 提出MSM-Seg框架，通过双记忆分割范式整合多模态和切片间信息，使用类别无关提示进行脑肿瘤分割，在多个MRI数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的分割方法忽视跨模态相关性，依赖劳动密集的类别特定提示，限制了在真实场景中的适用性。

Method: 引入模态和切片记忆注意力(MSMA)挖掘跨模态和切片间关系，设计多尺度类别无关提示编码器(MCP-Encoder)提供肿瘤区域指导，开发模态自适应融合解码器(MF-Decoder)利用不同模态的互补解码信息。

Conclusion: MSM-Seg框架通过创新的双记忆分割范式有效解决了多模态脑肿瘤分割中的跨模态相关性和提示效率问题。

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

TL;DR: 提出一个多模态自动化框架，用于SEM图像中的比例尺检测和提取，结合目标检测、文本识别和LLM代理，显著提高了分析效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SEM图像比例尺检测主要依赖人工操作，耗时且易出错，需要自动化解决方案来提高分析效率和准确性。

Method: 四阶段框架：1)自动数据集生成模型；2)比例尺目标检测；3)混合OCR系统进行信息提取；4)LLM代理验证结果准确性。

Result: 目标检测精度100%，召回率95.8%，mAP@0.5为99.2%；混合OCR系统在自动生成数据集上达到89%精度、65%召回率和75%F1分数，显著优于主流独立引擎。

Conclusion: 该自动化方法显著提升了SEM图像比例尺检测和提取的效率和准确性，为显微分析和科学成像领域提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为状态特定模型（SSM）的新框架，统一并增强了动作检测和预测任务，通过关键状态记忆压缩、动作模式学习和跨时间交互模块来减少冗余信息并建模动作动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未修剪视频通常包含大量冗余信息和噪声，且在动作理解建模中往往忽略了智能体意图对动作的影响。

Method: SSM框架包含三个模块：关键状态记忆压缩模块压缩帧序列为关键状态；动作模式学习模块构建多维边状态转移图建模动作动态；跨时间交互模块通过跨时间交互建模意图与过去及当前信息的相互影响。

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens-100、THUMOS'14、TVSeries和PDMB等多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该框架优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: 动作动态学习和跨时间交互对于动作理解研究具有重要意义，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

*Samer Al-Hamadani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次对监督学习检测器(YOLO)和零样本视觉语言模型(Gemini)进行了成本效益分析，建立了架构选择的量化平衡点阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督检测需要大量标注成本，而零样本VLM虽然准确率较低但无需标注。需要系统比较两种方法的成本效益，为实际部署提供决策依据。

Method: 在1000张分层COCO图像和200张多样化产品图像上进行系统评估，结合详细的总拥有成本建模，建立定量平衡阈值。

Result: 监督YOLO准确率91.2%，零样本Gemini准确率68.5%，但Gemini在未训练类别上仍有52.3%准确率而YOLO为0%。监督方法仅在超过5500万次推理时才具有成本效益。

Conclusion: 最优架构选择取决于部署量、类别稳定性、预算约束和准确率要求，而非纯粹的技术性能指标。

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架成功解决了同时处理散焦和运动模糊的挑战，通过可靠的模糊核估计和优化策略实现了高质量的新视角合成。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用未标记域数据训练ControlNet的方法，通过引入不确定性控制机制，结合语义控制，生成目标域的高不确定性标注数据，显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ControlNet倾向于复制原始训练分布，限制了数据增强效果。需要利用未标记域数据来扩展训练分布，特别是在存在大域偏移的场景中（如视网膜OCT图像）。

Method: 在控制机制中引入不确定性概念，结合来自未标记数据集的不确定性控制和来自标记数据集的语义控制，训练能够生成目标域标注数据的ControlNet。

Result: 在视网膜OCT实验中，该方法显著改善了Home-OCT域的分割结果，无需额外监督。在交通场景实验中也验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 不确定性引导方法能够实现任意域偏移而无需严格学习图像风格，优于风格迁移方法，为跨域分割任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

Abstract: We present WorldMirror, an all-in-one, feed-forward model for versatile 3D
geometric prediction tasks. Unlike existing methods constrained to image-only
inputs or customized for a specific task, our framework flexibly integrates
diverse geometric priors, including camera poses, intrinsics, and depth maps,
while simultaneously generating multiple 3D representations: dense point
clouds, multi-view depth maps, camera parameters, surface normals, and 3D
Gaussians. This elegant and unified architecture leverages available prior
information to resolve structural ambiguities and delivers geometrically
consistent 3D outputs in a single forward pass. WorldMirror achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks from camera, point map,

Conclusion: DocReward模型能够有效评估文档的结构和风格质量，在指导生成智能体产生人类偏好的文档方面表现出优越性能，填补了现有文档生成工作流在视觉结构评估方面的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors
and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach
for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

### [143] [Restricted Receptive Fields for Face Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10753)
*Kagan Ozturk,Aman Bhatta,Haiyu Wu,Patrick Flynn,Kevin W. Bowyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部补丁相似性的人脸相似度度量方法，通过将全局相似度分解为受限感受野的贡献，提供无需后处理分析的局部可加性解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏可靠的评估指标，现有后处理方法对模型实际推理过程的保真度存在不确定性，因此需要设计决策过程本身可解释的模型。

Method: 将两个人脸图像的相似度定义为补丁级相似度分数的总和，通过分解全局相似度为受限感受野的贡献，实现局部可加性解释。

Result: 在112x112人脸图像中使用28x28补丁时达到竞争性验证性能，使用56x56补丁时超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种内在可解释的人脸相似度度量，既能保持竞争性能，又能提供透明的决策过程解释。

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Abstract: Identifying drones and birds correctly is essential for keeping the skies
safe and improving security systems. Using the VIP CUP 2025 dataset, which
provides both RGB and infrared (IR) images, this study presents EGD-YOLOv8n, a
new lightweight yet powerful model for object detection. The model improves how
image features are captured and understood, making detection more accurate and
efficient. It uses smart design changes and attention layers to focus on
important details while reducing the amount of computation needed. A special
detection head helps the model adapt to objects of different shapes and sizes.
We trained three versions: one using RGB images, one using IR images, and one
combining both. The combined model achieved the best accuracy and reliability
while running fast enough for real-time use on common GPUs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NV3D提出了一种新的3D物体检测方法，通过从体素邻居提取法向量特征来增强特征表示，并采用两种采样策略减少55%数据量同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态方法面临特征对齐挑战，而局部特征提取方法对于复杂3D检测任务可能过于简化。需要更有效的特征表示方法。

Method: 使用KNN和PCA计算每个体素的法向量特征，提出密度采样和FOV感知分箱采样两种策略，并应用元素级注意力融合机制。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，NV3D在汽车和自行车检测上表现优异，无采样时分别达到86.60%和80.18% mAP，比基线提升2.61%和4.23%；采样后仍保持85.54% mAP。

Conclusion: 法向量特征能有效提升3D物体检测性能，采样策略可显著减少计算量而不牺牲精度，特别适用于具有空间形状的物体检测。

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Motivation: 随着CT检查量增加，需要自动化工具支持放射科医生。现有3D CNN方法难以捕捉长距离依赖，而Vision Transformers需要大量领域特定预训练。

Method: 将3D CT体积表示为结构化图，轴向切片三元组作为节点，通过谱图卷积处理，支持切片间依赖关系推理。

Result: 在3个独立机构数据集上训练评估，实现强跨数据集泛化能力，性能与最先进视觉编码器相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持临床部署兼容性的同时，有效处理3D CT多标签分类问题，并展示在放射学报告生成和腹部CT数据上的广泛适用性。

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动概念发现方法往往无法将提取的概念与模型真实决策过程对齐，从而损害解释的忠实度。

Method: FACE框架在非负矩阵分解基础上加入KL散度正则化项，在概念学习过程中融入分类器监督，强制预测一致性。

Result: 在ImageNet、COCO和CelebA数据集上的系统评估表明，FACE在忠实度和稀疏性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FACE通过理论保证和实验验证，提供了一种能够生成忠实概念解释的有效框架。

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Result: 在Math-VR基准上比基线模型提升21%，验证了代码驱动推理范式的有效性

Conclusion: 为多模态数学推理开辟了新方向，提供了首个大规模数据集、基准测试和强有力方法

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at
https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D可变形模型依赖严格拓扑结构和线性特性，难以表示复杂的全头部形状。现有方法将潜在空间划分为局部组件，导致潜在维度庞大且效率低下。

Method: 保留单一紧凑的身份空间，引入中间区域特定潜在表示来实现局部编辑。使用大规模数据集（4000个不同身份）进行训练。

Result: 实验证明该方法在表示多样化身份和表情方面优于先前方法，具有更强的表达能力。

Conclusion: imHead不仅能够有效建模3D头部头像，还提供可解释的3D面部操作解决方案，支持用户进行局部编辑。

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

Motivation: 高质量的公开分割标注对图像处理领域至关重要，特别是体积图像的大规模标注耗时且困难。现有公开数据集中缺乏完整的3D时间推移细胞迁移分割标注。

Method: 三名不同标注者对Cell Tracking Challenge中的两个MDA231细胞序列进行了完整的3D时间推移分割标注，并与CTC提供的自动生成的silver truth和现有跟踪标记进行了比较分析。

Result: 创建的标注与CTC发布的跟踪标记一致，分割精度在标注者间变异性范围内。与自动生成的silver truth相比，提出的标注能更好地表示输入图像的复杂性。

Conclusion: 该3D标注数据集可用于测试和训练细胞分割算法，或分析高度动态物体的3D形状，填补了公开数据集中3D时间推移细胞迁移分割标注的空白。

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

Motivation: 现有基于transformer的3D人体网格恢复模型计算成本高且复杂，主要由于深层transformer架构和冗余令牌

Method: 使用ECLM选择性合并对MPJPE影响最小的transformer层，Mask-ToMe合并对预测贡献小的背景令牌，并采用扩散解码器结合时间上下文和姿态先验

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现2.3倍加速，性能相比基线略有提升

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了3D人体网格恢复的计算复杂度，同时保持甚至略微提升了性能

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

Motivation: 现有场景文本编辑方法通常局限于内容替换和简单风格，缺乏自由风格迁移能力，无法实现灵活和局部化的文本风格编辑。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在场景文本风格转换方面表现优异，在视觉保真度和文本保持方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SceneTextStylizer框架成功解决了场景文本灵活局部风格编辑的挑战，实现了高质量的风格迁移效果。

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

Motivation: 解决纹理less物体6D姿态估计中深度信息缺失的问题，现有多视角方法要么依赖深度数据，要么未能充分利用多视角几何线索。

Method: 设计三阶段渐进式姿态优化策略，利用密集多视角关键点几何信息；通过注意力聚合和对称感知训练增强关键点网络，提高预测精度并解决对称物体的模糊性。

Result: 在ROBI数据集上的大量实验表明，DKPMV优于最先进的多视角RGB方法，在大多数情况下甚至超过了RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: 仅使用RGB图像就能实现高质量的6D姿态估计，为工业机器人应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level
fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage
progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint
geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the
keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training,
improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects.
Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods
in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

Method: 基于重建稳定性假设：ID图像在随机测量变化下重建稳定，而OOD图像重建不稳定。通过计算重建变异性作为OOD指标，无需训练分布知识或重新训练成本。

Result: 在MNIST数字断层重建实验中，仅用数字"0"训练的模型评估所有数字，OOD数字显示出更高的变异性，与重建误差高度相关，验证了该指标的有效性。

Conclusion: 该指标为生成先验提供轻量级防护机制，可在ID情况下实现激进测量减少，同时自动警告OOD应用，增强部署安全性。

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

TL;DR: 提出IUT-Plug模块，通过图像理解树增强现有交错视觉语言模型，解决逻辑、对象身份和风格方面的上下文漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图像-文本生成中难以保持逻辑、对象身份和风格的一致性，限制了在复杂多模态场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：动态IUT-Plug提取模块将视觉场景解析为层次符号结构；协调的叙事流和图像合成机制确保跨模态一致性。

Result: 实验表明IUT-Plug不仅提高了现有基准的准确性，还有效缓解了三种关键上下文漂移形式。

Conclusion: IUT-Plug通过显式结构化推理增强了交错视觉语言模型，在多模态问答场景中显著改善了上下文一致性。

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

TL;DR: Chart-RVR是一个通过可验证奖励和组相对策略优化来增强大型视觉语言模型在图表推理任务中的鲁棒性和可解释性的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在图表推理任务中，特别是在分布外数据上表现不佳，且在生成思维链推理时性能进一步下降，限制了模型的可解释性。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)结合三个自动可验证的奖励：(i) 正确图表类型分类，(ii) 忠实图表表格重建，(iii) 过程一致性，对30亿参数的大型视觉语言模型进行微调。

Result: Chart-RVR在分布内和分布外数据集上均优于标准监督微调，缩小了OOD性能差距并提高了推理忠实度，在六个图表推理基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: Chart-RVR通过可验证奖励和GRPO训练出了更可靠、可解释的图表推理模型，增强了信任和可靠性。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出了Multimodal Mixup (MM)和Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM)方法来解决多模态视频理解中的模态不平衡问题，通过特征混合和动态调整混合比例来改善泛化能力和模态鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型容易过拟合强模态，导致弱模态贡献被抑制，需要解决模态不平衡问题以提升模型性能。

Method: MM在多模态特征层面应用Mixup策略生成虚拟特征-标签对；B-MM在此基础上根据各模态对学习目标的贡献动态调整混合比例。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，所提方法能有效提升泛化能力和多模态鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的MM和B-MM方法能有效缓解多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题，提高模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in
virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained
diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential
requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work,
we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian
inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency
verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines
inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views
adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as
prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views,
PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting
quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and
NeRFiller datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness and
generalization capability.

TL;DR: ContextGen是一个用于多实例图像生成的Diffusion Transformer框架，通过布局和参考图像引导生成，解决了现有扩散模型在对象布局控制和多主体身份保持方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代扩散模型在多实例图像生成中存在关键限制，难以实现精确的对象布局控制并保持多个不同主体的身份一致性。

Method: 提出了ContextGen框架，包含两个关键技术：上下文布局锚定机制（CLA）将复合布局图像整合到生成上下文中，确保对象精确定位；身份一致性注意力（ICA）利用上下文参考图像确保多实例身份一致性。同时构建了IMIG-100K数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明，ContextGen在控制精度、身份保真度和整体视觉质量方面优于现有方法，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: ContextGen通过创新的CLA和ICA机制，结合大规模数据集IMIG-100K，成功解决了多实例图像生成中的布局控制和身份保持问题，为相关领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

Motivation: 基础模型在复杂低对比度背景下难以聚焦前景区域，特别是当恶性肿瘤与正常器官相似时，上下文区分变得困难。

Method: FASS框架包含三个模块：前景感知模块增强背景与整体空间区分；基于小波变换的频率增强模块提取高频特征；边缘约束模块保持分割边界的几何连续性。

Result: 在多个医学数据集上的实验显示，该方法在所有指标上都表现出优越性能，特别是在复杂条件下的鲁棒性和精细结构识别方面。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了低对比度图像的分割效果，为更复杂多样的医学成像场景应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

Conclusion: COCO-Tree有效提升了VLM的组合推理能力，同时提供了可解释的推理过程

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架成功扩展了Mamba用于视频人体姿态估计，能够有效学习全局和局部的高分辨率时空表示，在性能和计算效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

Conclusion: GIR-Bench为系统评估多模态模型提供了全面框架，揭示了理解与生成对齐的挑战，并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP

Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations

Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

TL;DR: ICCV 2025 LSVOS挑战赛报告，包含三个赛道：传统VOS、RVOS和新引入的MOSEv2，后者增加了更复杂的真实场景挑战，采用新评估指标J&Ḟ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动视频对象分割在真实场景中的鲁棒性，超越精心设计的基准测试，关注长期一致性和泛化能力。

Method: 引入MOSEv2赛道，增加密集小物体、频繁消失重现、严重遮挡、恶劣天气和光照等挑战性场景，采用J&Ḟ作为主要评估指标。

Result: 总结了数据集和协议，展示了顶级解决方案，发现LLM/MLLM组件和内存感知传播等新兴趋势。

Conclusion: 为野外环境下具有弹性和语言感知能力的视频分割技术指明了未来发展方向。

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

TL;DR: 提出SeerDrive框架，通过联合建模未来场景演化和轨迹规划，在端到端自动驾驶中实现闭环决策


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端自动驾驶方法依赖当前场景上下文，低估了场景动态性和时间演化的重要性，限制了在复杂驾驶场景中的适应性决策能力

Method: 引入双向关系建模：预测未来鸟瞰图表示来预判周围场景动态，利用这种前瞻性生成未来上下文感知的轨迹；包含未来感知规划和迭代场景建模两个关键组件

Result: 在NAVSIM和nuScenes基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 未来轨迹与环境动态演化紧密交织，SeerDrive通过闭环联合建模实现了更明智和自适应的驾驶决策

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于监督扩散的去噪框架，通过配对对抗-干净图像数据集微调扩散模型，结合提示优化，显著提升多模态大语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答任务中的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型容易受到对抗攻击，现有防御方法如对抗训练和输入净化存在计算成本高、图像质量下降和泛化能力不足等问题。

Method: 使用配对对抗-干净图像数据集微调扩散模型，结合任务特定的方向性指导，并引入提示优化作为补充防御机制。

Result: 在图像描述和视觉问答任务上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了鲁棒性，并对未知对抗攻击表现出强迁移性。

Conclusion: 监督扩散去噪方法为多模态防御提供了有效解决方案，有助于多模态大语言模型在现实应用中的可靠和安全部署。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能生成合理且语义一致的3D场景运动。

Conclusion: MoMap表示和扩散模型能有效学习3D运动先验，为3D运动预测和2D视频合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

TL;DR: DiPro框架通过区域感知解耦和多时间尺度对齐，解决了纵向多模态数据中CXR序列冗余和与EHR数据时间不对齐的问题，在疾病进展识别和ICU预测任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向多模态数据（如EHR和连续CXR）对疾病进展建模至关重要，但存在两个关键挑战：连续CXR序列中的冗余（静态解剖区域主导临床有意义的动态变化）以及稀疏、不规则成像数据与连续EHR数据之间的时间不对齐。

Method: 1. 在连续CXR中解耦静态（解剖）和动态（病理进展）特征，优先考虑疾病相关变化；2. 通过局部（成对间隔级）和全局（全序列）同步，分层对齐这些静态和动态CXR特征与异步EHR数据，以建模连贯的进展路径。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上的广泛实验表明，DiPro能有效提取时间临床动态，在疾病进展识别和一般ICU预测任务上实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DiPro框架成功解决了纵向多模态数据中的关键挑战，通过区域感知解耦和多时间尺度对齐，有效建模疾病进展，在临床预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

Method: 使用CLIP作为强教师模型，少样本视觉编码器作为弱学生模型，通过无监督代理任务蒸馏语义对齐的视觉知识；包含训练自由的协同知识挖掘模块、视觉-语义桥接模块、视觉权重生成器和语义权重重构器

Result: 在四个少样本学习数据集上的实验结果表明，即使与简单的少样本视觉编码器配对，SynTrans也显著优于当前最先进方法

Conclusion: SynTrans框架通过有效转移大型多模态模型的多样化互补知识，成功提升了少样本学习的性能

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中难以准确遵循计数指令，研究发现单纯扩大数据集和模型规模无法解决计数问题，提出通过向噪声先验注入计数感知的布局信息来有效控制物体数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型是否能够通过扩大数据集和模型规模来准确生成文本提示中指定的物体数量，因为现有模型如FLUX和GPT-4o在计数任务上表现不佳。

Method: 构建了两个合成数据集GrayCount250和NaturalCount6用于评估，分析了扩散模型依赖噪声初始化而非文本提示的问题，并提出通过向噪声先验注入计数感知布局信息的方法。

Result: 单纯扩大模型和数据集无法提高计数准确率，而提出的方法在GrayCount250上准确率从20.0%提升到85.3%，在NaturalCount6上从74.8%提升到86.3%。

Conclusion: 扩散模型本身无法通过规模扩展解决计数问题，但通过注入计数感知的布局信息可以显著提高计数准确率，且具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多流形证据融合网络(MMEFnet)，用于有效融合PolSAR协方差矩阵和多特征这两个互补视图，通过流形学习和证据理论实现更可靠、可解释的分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统融合方法忽视了协方差矩阵和多特征位于不同流形上的几何结构差异，忽略了不同视图的重要性差异和不确定性，导致预测不可靠。

Method: 将协方差矩阵建模在Hermitian正定流形上，多特征建模在Grassmann流形上，构建两个不同的核度量学习网络学习流形表示，然后使用可信多视图证据融合估计置信质量并量化不确定性，最后基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合证据。

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMEFnet成功地将PolSAR流形学习和证据融合集成到统一架构中，实现了更可靠和可解释的分类性能。

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

TL;DR: CoPRS是一个基于多模态思维链的位置感知模型，通过可微分的热图将语言推理与分割任务连接起来，提高了可解释性和分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接将语言模型的隐藏特征连接到掩码解码器或用文本表示位置，限制了可解释性和语义细节。需要一种更清晰、可解释的方式来连接推理和分割。

Method: 使用多模态思维链(MCoT)生成可微分的位置先验热图，通过可学习的集中令牌聚合图像和推理文本特征，然后用轻量级解码器生成精确掩码。

Result: 在RefCOCO系列和ReasonSeg数据集上，CoPRS在可比协议下达到或超过了最佳报告指标，在验证集和测试集上的性能均达到或超过先前的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 热图质量强烈影响掩码质量，证明了推理输出与下游掩码生成之间的一致关联。该范式在连接推理和分割方面具有实用性，在推理驱动的集中性和更精确的掩码预测方面显示出优势。

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

Motivation: 传统跨模态对齐方法假设嵌入仅包含语义信息，忽略了非语义信息（风格变化）的影响，导致信息偏差或丢失。

Method: 提出PICO框架，量化每个特征列表示语义信息的概率作为嵌入交互权重，并采用基于性能反馈的原型迭代构建方法确保语义概率可靠性。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型骨干网络上，PICO优于现有最先进方法5.2%-14.1%。

Conclusion: PICO通过有效分离语义和风格信息，显著提升了跨模态对齐的性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis是一个多模态、多文化基准，用于评估视觉语言模型在日常文化知识方面的鲁棒性，涵盖语言改写和视觉模态，揭示了当前模型在文化理解上的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在全球部署，评估其对文化情境知识的理解能力变得至关重要。现有评估主要关注静态回忆或孤立视觉基础，未能验证模型是否具备鲁棒且可迁移的文化理解能力。

Method: 基于BLEnD数据集构建313个文化基础问题模板，涵盖16个地区，生成三种对齐的多选格式：文本基线查询、倒置文本变体和VQA风格版本，包含4,916张图像和超过21,000个多选问题实例。

Result: 当前VLM文化知识存在显著脆弱性，模型在语言改写下性能下降，视觉线索虽有助于性能但跨模态一致性低，特别是在低资源地区，文本和视觉理解的鲁棒整合面临挑战。

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis为系统分析文化鲁棒性和多模态基础提供了关键测试平台，揭示了局限性并指导开发更具文化能力的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Motivation: 研究沙特手语翻译面临的挑战，特别是面纱等独特特征对手语识别和翻译的困难，探索如何利用大规模美国手语数据来改进沙特手语翻译系统。

Method: 使用T5模型，比较在YouTubeASL数据集上预训练的模型与直接在SSL数据集上训练的模型，采用包含三个挑战性测试协议的新型SSL数据集进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，在YouTubeASL上预训练的模型性能显著优于直接训练的模型，BLEU-4指标提升了约3倍，证明了跨语言迁移的有效性。

Conclusion: 利用大规模ASL数据可以显著改善SSL翻译性能，为开发更有效的手语翻译系统提供了重要见解，证明了手语模型的跨语言可迁移性。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our
code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

*Shengming Yuan,Xinyu Lyu,Shuailong Wang,Beitao Chen,Jingkuan Song,Lianli Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FlexAC框架，通过调节多模态大语言模型的联想推理强度，在忠实性和创造性之间实现灵活平衡。该方法利用幻觉诱导的中间表示来构建联想导向向量，在创造任务上实现5.8倍提升，幻觉率降低29%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法缺乏调节联想推理强度的灵活性，限制了模型在事实性和创造性场景之间的适应性。需要一种能够灵活控制联想行为的方法。

Method: FlexAC框架：1）发现中间层在塑造联想倾向中的关键作用；2）利用幻觉诱导中间表示编码联想方向；3）选择高联想实例构建联想导向向量；4）自适应校准向量强度平衡创造性与稳定性；5）引入任务特定联想向量适应多样化任务。

Result: 在Creation-MMBench上创造力提升5.8倍，在CHAIR上幻觉率降低29%，超越了现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FlexAC提供了一种轻量级、无需训练的方法来灵活控制MLLM的联想推理，有效平衡了忠实性和创造性需求，显著提升了模型在多样化任务上的适应性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于类别原型的监督对比学习方法，用于检测在线视频中的教育内容，特别是识字和数学类内容。该方法使用多模态transformer网络捕捉视觉和音频线索的交互，在自建数据集APPROVE上表现优于现有基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着儿童早期在线媒体消费的增长，需要数据驱动工具帮助教育工作者筛选适合年轻学习者的教育内容。

Method: 采用基于类别原型的监督对比学习，为每个类别学习原型，最小化类别原型与同类样本的距离，最大化与其他类别样本的距离。使用多模态transformer网络捕捉视觉和音频线索的交互。

Result: 在APPROVE数据集（193小时专家标注视频，19个类别）上，该方法优于YouTube-8M和COIN等基准模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测在线视频中的教育内容，特别是处理细粒度多标签分类问题，为儿童教育内容筛选提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究证明仅通过面部表情的动态成分就能识别个体身份，与静态面部外观无关。在1,429人的数据集上达到61.14%的识别准确率，458倍于随机猜测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否仅凭面部表情的动态特征就能识别个体身份，而不依赖静态面部形状，探索面部动态中是否包含个人特有的身份特征。

Method: 使用FLAME 3D可变形模型分离面部形状和表情动态，仅保留表情和下颌参数。采用Conformer模型和监督对比学习进行识别。引入漂移噪声比(DNR)量化形状与表情分离的可靠性。

Result: 在1,429人分类任务中达到61.14%准确率，远高于随机水平。DNR与识别性能呈强负相关，证实不稳定的形状估计会损害动态识别效果。

Conclusion: 面部动态携带强烈的个人身份特征，这一发现对社会感知和临床评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Motivation: 当前医学图像分割方法在结构表示和上下文建模方面存在局限，影响在复杂临床场景中的泛化能力。

Method: DTEA模型包含STR模块（将多尺度语义特征重组为动态超图以建模跨分辨率解剖依赖）和EPG模块（通过扰动评估通道稳定性并过滤高熵通道以增强空间注意力）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该框架实现了优越的分割精度和跨临床场景的更好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的DTEA模型通过改进的跳跃连接框架有效提升了医学图像分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic
hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy
and better generalization across various clinical settings. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了Class Vectors方法，通过在潜在空间中捕获类别特定的表示调整，实现图像分类器的灵活编辑，包括类别遗忘、分布适应等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类器编辑方法要么局限于错误修正，要么需要大量重新训练成本，难以实现灵活编辑，特别是在图像分类领域缺乏有效解决方案。

Method: 引入Class Vectors概念，在微调过程中捕获类别特定的表示调整。这些向量在潜在空间中解耦每个类别的适应，可以通过特征引导或权重空间映射来更新决策边界。

Result: Class Vectors能够捕获每个类别的语义偏移，其固有的线性和正交性支持通过简单的类别算术实现高效、灵活的高层概念编辑。

Conclusion: Class Vectors在遗忘学习、环境适应、对抗防御和对抗触发器优化等应用中展现出实用性，为分类器编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

TL;DR: HaDola框架通过人类不确定性感知的数据选择和自动标注，减少对昂贵人工标注的依赖，使视觉语言模型在更少训练数据下达到或超越最先进方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集存在人类不确定性（HU）——不同标注者置信度存在差异，但标准监督微调仅优化最频繁标签，忽视了HU分布。这引发两个问题：HU如何影响SFT训练，以及如何有效利用HU？

Method: 提出HaDola框架，包含四个阶段：区分、自标注、错误触发和训练，通过迭代识别有害样本、优先选择信息丰富的样本，从5%的小种子集进行引导训练。

Result: 在VQAv2和VizWiz数据集上的广泛实验表明，HaDola在更少训练数据下持续匹配或超越最先进的基线方法，使模型更准确且校准更好。

Conclusion: 工作强调了在监督微调中显式建模人类不确定性的重要性，表明更好地利用HU比单纯扩大数据集规模更有效。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在实际应用中会遇到分布内数据和分布外数据，其中OOD数据包括协变量偏移和语义偏移。需要提高模型对协变量偏移OOD数据的泛化能力，同时有效检测开放集语义偏移的OOD类别。

Method: 提出ΔEnergy OOD评分方法，基于重新对齐视觉-语言模态时的能量变化；开发EBM框架通过ΔEnergy的下界最大化来同时改进OOD检测和泛化；建立统一微调框架。

Result: 在具有挑战性的OOD检测和泛化基准测试中表现出优越性，相比现有方法在AUROC指标上提升10%到25%。

Conclusion: ΔEnergy方法显著优于基于能量的OOD评分，EBM框架理论证明能同时提升OOD检测和泛化能力，为视觉语言模型提供了统一的鲁棒性改进方案。

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

Motivation: 解决基于草图的3D重建中由于草图抽象稀疏、缺乏足够语义和几何信息而导致的挑战

Method: 两阶段生成方法：1) 通过草图到图像转换进行语义桥接，丰富稀疏草图表示；2) 引入对称约束作为几何先验，利用日常物体的结构规律性

Result: 在主流草图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在倒角距离、地球移动距离和F分数方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: 提出的语义桥接和对称感知设计有效提升了草图到3D形状重建的性能

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了SAR图像预处理、洪水制图和水深估计方法，发现方法选择和超参数调整对洪水范围和水深估计有显著影响，建议采用集成方法考虑整个处理流程的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水制图和水深估计对于校准和验证水力模型至关重要，需要评估不同处理方法及其参数选择对结果的影响。

Method: 使用SAR图像，通过集成预处理图像、洪水图和水深场，评估不同预处理（特别是斑点噪声减少）、洪水制图和水深估计方法，以法国加龙河2019和2021年两次洪水事件为案例，使用水动力模拟和现场观测作为参考数据。

Result: 斑点滤波器的选择会改变洪水范围估计，变化达数平方公里；监督方法优于无监督方法，但调优的无监督方法（如局部阈值或变化检测）可获得相当结果；预处理和洪水制图步骤的累积不确定性导致水深场估计的高变异性。

Conclusion: 应考虑整个处理流程（预处理、洪水制图和水深估计方法及其超参数），优先采用集成方法并考虑方法不确定性；洪水制图中方法选择影响最大，水深估计中洪水图输入和方法超参数影响最大。

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

TL;DR: 提出了InternSVG系列，包括SAgoge数据集、SArena基准和InternSVG模型，通过多模态大语言模型实现SVG的统一建模，在理解和生成任务上取得显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SVG建模面临的挑战：数据集碎片化、方法跨任务迁移性差、结构复杂性处理困难

Method: 构建SAgoge数据集和SArena基准，提出InternSVG模型，采用SVG特定标记、子词嵌入初始化和两阶段训练策略

Result: 在SArena和现有基准上的实验表明，InternSVG相比领先的开源和专有模型取得显著提升

Conclusion: 通过统一建模方法实现了SVG理解、编辑和生成的正向迁移，提升了整体性能

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MMAP框架，通过多放大倍率特征提取和原型增强架构，从H&E染色全玻片图像预测空间转录组基因表达，解决了局部特征粒度不足和全局空间上下文覆盖不充分的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学技术能够测量基因表达并保留空间信息，但现有方法在从组织学图像预测基因表达时面临两个关键限制：局部特征提取粒度不足和全局空间上下文覆盖不充分。

Method: MMAP框架采用多放大倍率补丁表示来增强局部特征粒度，同时学习一组潜在原型嵌入作为玻片级信息的紧凑表示，以改善全局上下文理解。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，MMAP在多个评估指标（包括平均绝对误差、均方误差和皮尔逊相关系数）上始终优于所有现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MMAP框架通过同时解决局部特征粒度和全局空间上下文的问题，显著提高了从组织学图像预测空间基因表达的性能。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了基于推理的图像质量评估模型泛化能力的来源，并提出了一种无需推理过程的新算法RALI，在保持相似泛化性能的同时大幅降低了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于强化学习的推理型图像质量评估模型虽然泛化能力强，但其推理能耗和延迟过高，限制了实际部署。研究旨在理解其泛化机制并开发更高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过实验验证推理型模型将冗余视觉表示转换为紧凑的跨域对齐文本表示的能力，并基于此提出RALI算法，使用对比学习直接对齐图像与可泛化的文本表示，无需推理过程和加载大语言模型。

Result: RALI在质量评分任务中实现了与推理型模型相当的泛化性能，同时仅需不到5%的模型参数和推理时间。

Conclusion: 推理型IQA模型的泛化能力源于将视觉表示转换为跨域对齐文本表示的过程，而RALI通过直接学习这种表示，在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

Motivation: 现有方法在高斯泼溅中引入反射相关材质属性进行PBR渲染，但在有限环境建模下材质推断缺乏足够约束，导致光照锯齿和泛化能力下降。

Method: 1) 强制2D高斯在多视角下产生一致的材质图；2) 通过跨视角光度变化识别高反射区域作为反射强度先验；3) 引入基于2DGS光线追踪的环境建模策略处理间接光照。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，该方法能够忠实恢复光照和几何信息，在新视角合成中达到最先进的渲染质量。

Conclusion: 多视角一致的材质推断和更物理的环境建模是高斯泼溅中学习准确反射的关键，该方法显著提升了渲染质量。

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

Conclusion: LM-EEC框架通过有效融合自我-外部特征和增强长期记忆能力，成功解决了自我-外部视角对应任务的核心挑战。

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: 卫星影像与AIS融合的方法可行，支持近实时船队盘点、异常检测和内河监控，未来将扩展数据集、加入时序跟踪和多模态深度学习以提升可扩展性。

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

Conclusion: 该方法通过紧密耦合退化建模与融合过程，有效解决了退化图像融合问题，为实际应用提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/VGDCFusion.

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在新视角合成方面表现出色，但其表面重建能力尚未充分探索。由于高斯点的离散和非结构化特性，仅基于图像渲染损失的监督往往导致几何不准确和多视图对齐不一致。

Method: 1) 将边缘感知图像线索融入渲染损失以改善表面边界描绘；2) 引入可见性感知光度对齐损失来建模遮挡并鼓励高斯点间的准确空间关系；3) 结合法向量约束来细化高斯点的空间方向并改进局部表面估计；4) 利用深度图像特征嵌入来增强跨视图一致性。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在表面重建和新视角合成方面均实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过视图对齐方法显著增强了3D高斯溅射的几何表示能力，在保持高效渲染的同时实现了更准确的表面重建。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

Result: 在标准法向量积分基准测试中达到最先进结果，仅需几秒钟，在大分辨率法向量图上比像素级方法快一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法通过组件级优化显著提高了法向量积分的计算效率，同时保持了重建质量。

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing

Conclusion: 大规模激活在局部细节合成中起关键作用，DG策略能有效增强DiT模型的细节保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

Conclusion: 全方位图像理解是MLLMs面临的新挑战，ODI-Bench为评估提供了标准，Omni-CoT方法有效提升了模型性能，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

TL;DR: 通过幂律拟合预测胸部X光分类所需标注数据量，发现XrayCLIP和XraySigLIP相比ResNet-50基线显著减少所需标注样本，仅用50个标注案例就能准确预测最终性能平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光分类需要大量标注数据，基础模型虽能减少依赖，但具体需要多少标注样本仍不明确。

Method: 系统评估使用幂律拟合预测达到特定ROC-AUC阈值所需的训练规模，测试多种病理和基础模型。

Result: XrayCLIP和XraySigLIP相比ResNet-50基线显著减少所需标注样本，仅50个标注案例的学习曲线斜率就能准确预测最终性能平台。

Conclusion: 研究结果使从业者能够通过仅标注达到目标性能所需的基本样本来最小化标注成本。

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the
training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple
pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable
practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential
samples for targeted performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNAP是一个统一的交互式3D点云分割模型，支持跨域（室内、室外、空中）的点基和文本基提示，通过多数据集训练和领域自适应归一化实现泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D点云分割方法局限于单一领域和单一交互方式的问题，避免多数据集训练导致的负迁移，开发具有通用性的统一模型。

Method: 在7个跨域数据集上训练，使用领域自适应归一化防止负迁移；对于文本提示分割，自动生成掩码提案并与CLIP文本查询嵌入匹配。

Result: 在9个零样本基准测试中，8个达到最先进性能；在5个文本提示基准测试中均表现优异，证明统一模型可以超越专用领域方法。

Conclusion: SNAP展示了统一模型在3D点云分割中的可行性，为可扩展的3D标注提供了实用工具，实现了跨域泛化和多模态交互支持。

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

*Denis Zavadski,Damjan Kalšan,Tim Küchler,Haebom Lee,Stefan Roth,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用扩散模型将合成数据集适配到真实目标域的新框架，仅需不完美的伪标签即可生成高保真、目标对齐的图像，显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据集与真实图像存在明显差距，特别是在特定目标域（如Cityscapes）中，这种差距限制了模型性能。传统方法需要昂贵的3D建模，违背了低成本标注数据的初衷。

Method: 使用现成的扩散模型，仅通过不完美的伪标签来适应目标域。该方法过滤次优生成结果，纠正图像标签不对齐问题，并标准化跨数据集的语义，将弱合成数据转化为有竞争力的真实域训练集。

Result: 在五个合成数据集和两个真实目标数据集上的实验显示，分割性能比最先进的翻译方法提升了高达+8.0% mIoU，使快速构建的合成数据集与需要大量手动设计的高成本合成数据集同样有效。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了一种有价值的协作范式，即快速语义原型设计与生成模型相结合，能够为城市场景理解创建可扩展的高质量训练数据。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

Conclusion: 研究结果为基础模型在业务化高光谱作物制图中的应用提供了系统评估，并为未来模型开发指明了方向，强调了模型架构对于跨地理区域和传感器平台强泛化能力的重要性。

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for
hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three
foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery:
HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth
dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned
on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent
test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average
accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%),
DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of
93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved
91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong
generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results
provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational
hyperspectral crop mapping and outline directions for future model development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-Mix是一个用于多模态情感分析的自适应情感敏感数据增强框架，通过情感感知样本选择、情感强度引导的混合比例计算和情感对齐损失来解决传统Mixup方法在多模态场景中的标签模糊和语义不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析面临标注数据稀缺的问题，而传统的Mixup数据增强方法直接应用于多模态场景时会引入标签模糊和语义不一致的挑战，因为缺乏情感感知的混合机制。

Method: 提出MS-Mix框架，包含三个关键组件：1) 情感感知样本选择策略防止混合情感矛盾的样本；2) 情感强度引导模块使用多头自注意力动态计算模态特定的混合比例；3) 情感对齐损失通过KL散度损失对齐不同模态的预测分布。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和六个最先进骨干网络上的广泛实验表明，MS-Mix始终优于现有方法，为鲁棒的多模态情感增强建立了新标准。

Conclusion: MS-Mix通过情感感知的混合机制有效解决了多模态情感分析中的数据增强问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出ACE-G方法，通过将坐标回归器和地图表示分离为通用变换器和场景特定地图代码，显著提升了视觉重定位的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统场景坐标回归方法在训练视图和查询图像成像条件差异较大时容易失败，因为其设计本质上会过拟合训练视图。需要解决SCR方法的泛化能力不足问题。

Method: 将坐标回归器和地图表示分离为通用变换器和场景特定地图代码，在数千个场景上预训练变换器，使其能够从映射图像泛化到未见过的查询图像。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的重定位数据集上，ACE-G方法显著提高了鲁棒性，同时保持了有吸引力的计算开销。

Conclusion: 通过分离坐标回归器和地图表示，并利用大规模预训练，ACE-G成功解决了SCR方法的泛化问题，实现了更好的重定位性能。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽略了真实实验室工作的细粒度和长时程特性，无法准确评估MLLMs在科学发现加速方面的真正潜力，特别是在湿实验室环境中。

Method: 从同行评审的视频出版物中收集数据，建立三级任务层次：细粒度感知、程序理解、科学推理；采用视觉中心的标注流程，结合自动生成和多学科专家验证。

Result: 评估19个领先MLLMs发现，它们在粗粒度识别上表现良好，但在区分细粒度细节、跟踪状态变化以及将实验程序与科学结果关联方面存在困难；专有模型与开源模型之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ExpVid不仅提供了诊断工具，还为开发能够在科学实验中成为可信赖伙伴的MLLMs绘制了路线图。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有照片增强方法要么注重性能但无法在边缘设备部署，要么注重计算效率但实际应用性能不足，需要平衡性能与效率。

Method: 使用图像自适应的3D LUT处理全局色调，结合空间频率变换器权重预测器提取权重，并应用局部拉普拉斯滤波器细化高频细节。

Result: 在HDR+数据集上PSNR提升2.64 dB，4K分辨率图像处理仅需13ms，在两个基准数据集上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LLF-LUT++成功实现了高性能与高效率的平衡，为高分辨率图像增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the
InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen

*Boyang Zheng,Nanye Ma,Shengbang Tong,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出用表示自编码器（RAE）替代传统VAE作为扩散变换器的潜空间编码器，解决了VAE的架构过时、潜空间维度低和表示质量差等问题，实现了更好的图像生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散变换器使用的VAE编码器存在架构过时、潜空间维度限制信息容量、基于纯重建训练的表示质量差等问题，限制了生成质量。

Method: 使用预训练表示编码器（如DINO、SigLIP、MAE）配合训练的解码器构建表示自编码器（RAE），分析高维潜空间的挑战并提出理论解决方案，采用轻量级宽DDT头的DiT变体。

Result: 在ImageNet上获得强图像生成结果：256x256无引导FID 1.51，256x256和512x512有引导FID均为1.13，实现更快收敛且无需辅助表示对齐损失。

Conclusion: RAE具有明显优势，应成为扩散变换器训练的新标准方法。

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

*Sarah Harkins Dayton,Hayden Everett,Ioannis Schizas,David L. Boothe Jr.,Vasileios Maroulas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的贝叶斯拓扑CNN，结合拓扑感知学习和贝叶斯采样，在数据有限或损坏的情况下提供更好的性能和不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN需要大量训练数据，容易产生过度自信的预测，且缺乏不确定性量化能力。为了解决这些问题，需要结合拓扑学习和贝叶斯方法。

Method: 利用重要流形信息加速训练，通过在网络参数上放置先验分布并学习适当后验来减少校准误差。在损失函数中加入一致性条件来改进先验分布。

Result: 在基准图像分类数据集上优于传统CNN、贝叶斯神经网络和拓扑CNN，特别是在训练数据有限或损坏的情况下表现更优，能更好地识别分布外数据。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法在图像分类中具有更高效和鲁棒的潜力，特别是在不确定性量化和数据受限场景下。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

*Haoran Feng,Dizhe Zhang,Xiangtai Li,Bo Du,Lu Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiT360是一个基于DiT的框架，通过混合训练透视和全景数据来生成全景图像，解决了几何保真度和照片真实感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注模型设计，而全景图像生成质量不佳的主要原因是缺乏大规模、高质量的真实世界全景数据。

Method: 采用图像级和标记级的跨域转换和域内增强模块，包括透视图像引导、全景细化、循环填充、偏航损失和立方体损失等技术。

Result: 在文本到全景、修复和外延任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在11个定量指标上实现了更好的边界一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: DiT360通过数据中心的视角和混合训练策略，有效提升了全景图像生成的质量和几何保真度。

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Insta360-Research-Team/DiT360.

*Ayush Shrivastava,Sanyam Mehta,Daniel Geng,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用预训练视频扩散模型进行零样本点跟踪，通过在查询点放置彩色标记并重新生成视频来传播标记轨迹


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跟踪器和视频生成器解决密切相关的问题，前者分析运动，后者合成运动。这种联系使得预训练视频扩散模型能够通过视觉标记点来进行零样本点跟踪

Method: 在查询点放置独特颜色的标记，然后从中等噪声水平重新生成视频的其余部分，使用未编辑的初始帧作为负提示来确保标记在生成过程中保持可见

Result: 这种"涌现"轨迹优于先前的零样本方法，能够持续通过遮挡，性能与专门的自监督模型相当

Conclusion: 视频扩散模型能够有效执行零样本点跟踪任务，展示了生成模型在运动分析任务中的潜力

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ev4DGS是首个仅从单目事件流中渲染非刚性变形物体新视角的方法，使用可变形3D高斯泼溅表示，无需RGB输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法处理非刚性物体时需要稀疏RGB输入，这在实践中存在限制，本文探索是否仅从事件流就能学习类似模型。

Method: 通过1) 将估计模型输出与2D事件观测空间相关的损失函数，2) 从事件生成的二值掩码训练的粗略3D变形模型，来回归可变形3D高斯泼溅表示。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明Ev4DGS的有效性，相比多个朴素基线表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: Ev4DGS证明了仅从事件流渲染非刚性变形物体新视角的可行性，为事件相机在动态场景中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

TL;DR: 提出了一个表征具身AI神经症行为的框架，包括12种常见模式，并开发了在线检测器和逃逸策略。研究发现即使在全可见环境下，习得的厌恶成本也会导致持久的恐惧回避行为。


<details>

Motivation: 研究具身AI中出现的内部一致但与现实错配的行为模式（神经症），这些行为源于规划、不确定性处理和厌恶记忆之间的相互作用。

Method: 在网格导航系统中识别12种神经症模式，开发轻量级在线检测器和可重用的逃逸策略，使用遗传编程进行破坏性测试以最大化神经症得分。

Result: 成功识别了多种神经症行为模式，包括翻转变换、计划变动、持续循环等，并展示了即使在全可见环境下也会出现持久恐惧回避。

Conclusion: 局部修复不足，全局故障可能持续存在，需要通过破坏性测试来暴露需要架构级修订而非症状级修补的问题。

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

TL;DR: 提出了一种几何框架来研究LLM的推理过程，将推理建模为表示空间中的流动轨迹，分离逻辑结构与语义内容，并通过几何量分析推理行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型如何在表示空间中"思考"，探索LLM是否真正内化了逻辑而不仅仅是表面形式，为理解LLM推理行为提供新的分析视角。

Method: 使用几何框架将LLM推理建模为表示空间中的流动轨迹，通过相同自然演绎命题搭配不同语义载体来分离逻辑与语义，利用表示代理设计受控实验来可视化和量化推理流。

Result: 理论表明：(1)LLM推理对应表示空间中的平滑流动；(2)逻辑语句作为这些流动速度的局部控制器。通过实验验证了理论框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究推理现象提供了概念基础和实践工具，为LLM行为的可解释性和形式分析提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要假设完全自动化，未能反映真实世界中人机协作的本质，需要更严谨的人类-智能体交互评估方法。

Method: 开发PULSE评估框架，在基于开源软件智能体OpenHands的大规模网络平台上部署，收集超过15,000名用户的真实使用数据，研究LLM骨干网络、规划策略和记忆机制三种设计决策对开发者满意度的影响。

Result: 框架使智能体设计评估更加稳健，置信区间比标准A/B测试减少40%；发现真实环境结果与基准测试性能存在显著差异（如claude-sonnet-4和gpt-5结果呈负相关）。

Conclusion: 研究为人类参与的LLM智能体评估提供指导，识别了改进智能体设计的机会，强调了基准驱动评估的局限性。

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of
complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their
usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,
they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative
nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards
the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a
framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which
comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user
satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings
with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a
large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,
collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case
studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,
planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction
rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how
our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing
confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find
substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance
(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and
gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our
findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and
identify opportunities for better agent designs.

Motivation: 现有的地球观测驱动表示主要编码物理和光谱模式，缺乏捕捉城市功能和社会经济维度的能力，需要将人类活动语义融入地理空间基础模型

Method: 提出AETHER轻量级框架，通过POI多模态对齐将AlphaEarth嵌入与POI文本表示对齐，在预训练AE基础上进行语义增强

Result: 在伦敦地区，AETHER相比AE基线在土地利用分类F1分数上相对提升7.2%，在社会经济映射的KL散度上相对减少23.6%

Conclusion: 通过耦合地球观测与人类中心语义，AETHER推动了地理空间基础模型向整合物理形态和功能意义的通用城市表示发展

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

TL;DR: 研究发现，当AI系统整合用户记忆时，会在情感推理中产生系统性偏见，优势用户群体获得更准确的情感解读，导致AI个性化可能强化社会不平等。


<details>

Motivation: 随着个性化AI系统越来越多地整合长期用户记忆，理解这种记忆如何影响情感推理变得至关重要。

Method: 通过评估15个大型语言模型在人类验证的情感智力测试上的表现，分析相同情境下不同用户档案对情感解读的影响。

Result: 发现相同情境下不同用户档案会产生系统性不同的情感解读，多个高性能LLM中出现系统性偏见，优势用户档案获得更准确的情感解读。

Conclusion: 为个性化设计的AI系统可能无意中强化社会不平等，这是记忆增强AI面临的关键挑战。

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

Motivation: 大型语言模型存在严重的推理缺陷，包括产生幻觉和在逻辑谬误分类中准确性差，这源于其默认的快速直觉式系统1处理，而可靠推理需要深思熟虑的系统2方法。

Method: 创建了分步指令数据集，将谬误分类分解为一系列原子程序步骤（简单的二元问题），并增加了通过关系知识图谱进行最终验证的步骤。

Result: 这种程序化、基于规则的干预显著提高了LLM在逻辑谬误分类中的性能，并为决策过程提供了更好的透明度。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经符号架构解决LLM推理缺陷提供了一条实用路径，展示了低成本干预在改善模型推理能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

Motivation: 随着LLM在敏感日常场景中的部署，理解其在复杂道德推理中表现出的价值观至关重要。现有研究多关注单轮提示，但多轮对话中价值观通过对话、修正和共识形成的过程尚不清楚。

Method: 使用LLM辩论方法，让GPT-4.1、Claude 3.7 Sonnet和Gemini 2.0 Flash三个模型在1000个Reddit日常困境中集体分配责任，采用同步和轮询两种辩论格式测试顺序效应和裁决修正。

Result: 发现显著行为差异：同步设置中GPT表现出强惯性（0.6-3.1%修正率），而Claude和Gemini更灵活（28-41%）。价值观模式也不同：GPT强调个人自主权和直接沟通，Claude和Gemini优先考虑共情对话。辩论格式对模型行为有强烈影响。

Conclusion: 辩论格式和模型特定行为塑造了多轮交互中的道德推理，表明社会技术对齐不仅取决于系统输出，还取决于对话结构方式。

guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to
Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These
results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral
reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical
alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their
outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了RIPRAG攻击框架，一种针对检索增强生成系统的黑盒中毒攻击方法，使用强化学习优化中毒文档生成，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要针对简化的RAG架构进行白盒攻击，但在实际场景中，攻击者通常无法获取系统内部细节，且RAG系统包含多个组件，需要研究更复杂的黑盒攻击场景。

Method: 提出RIPRAG攻击框架，将目标RAG系统视为黑盒，仅利用攻击是否成功的信息，使用强化学习优化中毒文档生成模型，确保生成的中毒文档符合目标系统偏好。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法能有效攻击大多数复杂RAG系统，攻击成功率相比基线方法提升高达0.72。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了当前防御方法的普遍缺陷，为LLM安全研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can
effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems,
achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to
baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive
methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CE-Graph框架，将LLM工作流优化重新概念化为分布问题，通过最小化期望失败质量来系统性地减少失败分布，而不是最大化标量得分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM工作流优化方法存在信息坍塌问题，将丰富的执行轨迹简化为成功/失败信号，无法建模失败分布结构。

Method: 定义失败签名空间(FSS)，通过反例池近似失败分布，识别密集失败模式，使用提议-验证机制进行图编辑来贪婪减少失败质量。

Result: 在数学、代码和问答基准测试中，CE-Graph以显著更低的成本实现了更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 系统可靠性源于系统性地学习和重塑失败分布的几何结构，而非避免失败。

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

*Saleh Nikooroo,Thomas Engel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种图论框架，将可信度与置信度分离，通过收缩传播过程获得稳定的置信度值，定义推理区域作为高置信度、结构平衡的子图，并引入冲击更新来建模信念变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信念系统很少具有全局一致性，但有效的推理通常在局部持续存在。需要一种能够容忍矛盾并仅在结构支持的地方激活经典逻辑的推理基础。

Method: 使用有向、带符号、加权的图表示信念，节点为信念，边编码支持和矛盾。通过收缩传播过程计算置信度，定义推理区域为高置信度、结构平衡的子图，并提供近线性过程来构建区域图谱。引入冲击更新来建模信念变化。

Result: 在合成的带符号图中进行了实验，报告了区域恢复、冲击下的稳定性和运行时间。

Conclusion: 为容忍矛盾的推理提供了原则性基础，在结构支持的地方精确激活经典逻辑。

Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often
persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly
separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an
internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in
a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and
contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that
mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,
stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:
high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference
is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that
seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and
applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to
build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that
locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving
contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized
reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the
entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with
planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.
The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that
activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

TL;DR: SwarmSys是一个受群体智能启发的分布式多智能体推理框架，通过探索者、工作者和验证者三种角色的迭代交互实现协调，无需全局监督即可实现动态任务分配和自组织收敛。


<details>

Motivation: 现有多智能体框架通常依赖固定角色或集中控制，限制了长时推理的可扩展性和适应性。

Method: 集成自适应智能体和事件档案、基于嵌入的概率匹配以及信息素启发的强化机制，支持动态任务分配和自组织收敛。

Result: 在符号推理、研究综合和科学编程任务中，SwarmSys始终优于基线方法，提高了准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 群体启发的协调是扩展、鲁棒和自适应多智能体推理的有前景范式，协调扩展可能与模型扩展相媲美，以推进LLM智能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and
scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,
improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight
swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and
adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival
model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

TL;DR: SyncLipMAE是一个自监督预训练框架，通过学习同步感知和可转移的面部动态，将掩码视觉建模与跨模态对比对齐相结合，使用三个提示令牌编码身份、语音运动和周围运动，在多个下游任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从无标签的音频-视觉流中学习同步感知和可转移的面部动态，解决传统方法在跨模态对齐和下游任务泛化方面的局限性。

Method: 结合掩码视觉建模与跨模态对比对齐，使用三个提示令牌（身份、语音运动、周围运动），通过对比目标将两种模态映射到共享嵌入空间。

Result: 在四个需要不同能力的任务系列中实现最先进的结果，包括音频-视觉流同步、面部表情识别、视觉语音识别和视觉配音。

Conclusion: 同步感知、因子化的自监督预训练在多种任务中表现出有效性，证明了该框架的通用性和强大性能。

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

TL;DR: StepFly是一个用于自动化故障排除指南执行的端到端智能框架，通过三阶段工作流解决现有LLM方案在TSG质量、复杂控制流、数据密集型查询和执行并行化方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模IT系统中的故障管理依赖故障排除指南，但手动执行缓慢且易出错。现有基于LLM的解决方案缺乏对TSG质量问题、复杂控制流解释、数据密集型查询处理和执行并行化的专门支持。

Method: StepFly采用三阶段工作流：1) TSG Mentor工具帮助SRE改进TSG质量；2) 离线预处理使用LLM从非结构化TSG中提取结构化执行DAG并创建专用查询准备插件；3) 在线执行使用DAG引导的调度器-执行器框架，支持并行执行独立步骤。

Result: 在真实TSG和事件上的评估显示，StepFly在GPT-4.1上达到约94%的成功率，优于基线方法且时间和token消耗更少。对于可并行化的TSG，实现了32.9%到70.4%的显著执行时间减少。

Conclusion: StepFly通过其创新的三阶段框架有效解决了TSG自动化中的关键挑战，显著提高了故障排除的效率和成功率，为大规模IT系统的自动化事件管理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

TL;DR: 提出了DixitWorld评估套件，包含DixitArena多智能体环境和DixitBench静态基准，用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态溯因推理能力，发现模型在生成创造性和判别理解之间存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对视觉语言模型多模态溯因推理能力的评估主要局限于静态、单智能体任务，需要更全面的评估框架来解构这一挑战。

Method: 设计了DixitWorld评估套件，包含DixitArena（动态多智能体环境，评估假设生成和选择）和DixitBench（静态问答基准，隔离听者任务）。

Result: 较小开源模型在作为讲故事者时表现创造性但区分性较差，较大专有模型在整体性能特别是作为听者时表现更优。DixitBench与DixitArena听者结果强相关。

Conclusion: 多模态溯因推理中存在生成创造性和判别理解之间的关键权衡，这是开发更平衡、更有能力的视觉语言代理的核心挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保角色身份一致性在基于扩散的文本到图像生成中仍然是一个基本限制。

Method: 在冻结的扩散骨干网络上构建，使用提示感知控制动态组合适配器进行推理。

Result: 在多场景叙事实验中，CharCom显著提升了角色保真度、语义对齐和时间一致性，在拥挤场景中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CharCom能够以最小开销实现可扩展的多角色生成，非常适合故事插图和动画等实际应用。

Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a
fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose
CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves
character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters,
enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base
model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes
adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene
narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity,
semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes
and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making
it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and
animation.

Motivation: 现有简洁推理方法依赖手工启发式规则，难以平衡简洁性与性能，且无法跨领域和模型规模适应。

Method: 将简洁推理建模为约束优化问题，使用拉格朗日优化转化为无约束问题，并通过三个近似实现：离策略rollout估计性能、拉格朗日乘子截断、分位数驱动的长度调整。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上，输出长度减少65%，准确率提升15%，在五个基准测试中优于其他方法，且能适应不同领域和模型规模。

Conclusion: PALU是一种实用有效的简洁推理方法，能够跨领域和模型规模自适应地减少推理步骤，同时提升性能。

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

TL;DR: SAFER是一个两阶段风险控制框架，通过弃权感知采样和一致性过滤来解决开放性问题回答中缺乏固定有限解空间的问题，提供统计保证的风险控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在风险敏感应用中的部署，确保其输出的可信度变得至关重要。现有的一致性预测方法不切实际地假设所有实例的可接受答案可以通过有限采样获得，这在开放性问题回答场景中存在问题。

Method: SAFER采用两阶段框架：1) 在保留校准集上使用Clopper-Pearson精确方法校准采样预算；2) 应用一致性风险控制方法确定统计有效的置信度阈值，过滤候选集中的不可靠干扰项。

Result: SAFER能够控制采样集的最大允许错误覆盖率和正确答案被排除的风险，与各种任务特定的准入标准和校准-测试分割比率兼容。

Conclusion: SAFER提供了一个稳健且高效的数据风险控制框架，适用于开放性问题回答场景，能够提供统计保证的风险控制。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM智能体在复杂多轮工具使用任务中面临的高质量训练数据稀缺问题，避免监督微调导致的过拟合和标准强化学习面临的冷启动与训练不稳定问题。

Method: 环境调优范式，包含结构化课程编排、提供纠正反馈的环境增强、以及确保稳定高效探索的细粒度进度奖励。

Result: 在BFCL基准测试中，仅使用400个问题实例就实现了有竞争力的分布内性能，并展现出优越的分布外泛化能力，克服了SFT方法的性能崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 从基于静态轨迹的监督微调转向动态环境探索的范式转变，为训练更鲁棒和数据高效的智能体开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,
environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and
data-efficient agents.

Motivation: 现有激活引导方法依赖粗糙启发式，缺乏对引导位置和干预强度的原则性考虑，需要更可靠的行为控制方法来确保LLM的可信生成。

Method: 提出PIXEL框架：1) 从双视图（尾平均和末端token）学习属性对齐子空间；2) 通过约束几何目标选择干预强度；3) 样本级正交残差校准；4) 轻量级位置扫描识别注入点

Result: 在多样化模型和评估范式下，PIXEL持续改进属性对齐，同时保持模型通用能力，为LLM可控生成提供实用且原则性的方法。

Conclusion: PIXEL通过位置感知的激活引导，实现了可靠的对齐，同时保持模型性能，为LLM的可控生成提供了原则性解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

Motivation: 长推理模型在推理场景中表现出色，但存在因过度思考导致的计算成本增加和推理延迟问题，需要平衡推理性能与效率。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1) 监督微调阶段构建混合推理数据集；2) 强化学习阶段引入熵引导混合策略优化(EHPO)，在高熵单元进行分支并应用难度感知惩罚。

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on
various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational
costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these
limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扰动的关键神经元识别方法，发现大语言模型中存在超稀疏的关键神经元集合，这些神经元主要分布在模型外层，且破坏它们会导致模型性能急剧下降而非渐进式衰退。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类大脑中少量关键神经元对认知功能至关重要的神经科学研究启发，探索大语言模型中是否也存在类似的关键神经元子集。

Method: 提出基于扰动的关键神经元因果识别方法，系统性地定位大语言模型中的关键神经元。

Result: 发现：(1)大语言模型存在超稀疏关键神经元集合，破坏这些神经元会导致720亿参数模型完全崩溃，困惑度增加高达20个数量级；(2)关键神经元非均匀分布，主要集中在模型外层，特别是MLP down_proj组件；(3)性能退化呈现急剧的相变而非渐进式下降。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更鲁棒的模型架构和提高安全关键应用中的部署安全性提供了指导，深化了对大语言模型鲁棒性和可解释性的理解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级、可解释的两步插件方法，通过识别感知和推理导向的注意力头并调节其贡献，有效减少多模态大推理模型的幻觉问题，在多个模型和基准测试中平均提升5%，最高提升15%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大推理模型在视觉语言推理方面快速发展，但幻觉问题仍然是一个持续存在的失败模式，表现为错误的推理链和视觉内容的误解。研究发现注意力头存在阶段性分工：浅层头主要负责感知，深层头转向符号推理，这揭示了幻觉的两个主要原因：感知偏差和推理漂移。

Method: 提出功能性头识别和类条件重缩放的两步插件方法：1) 定位感知导向和推理导向的注意力头；2) 在不重新训练的情况下调节这些头的贡献。该方法完全模型无关，仅需<1%的额外计算和9%的基线延迟。

Result: 在三个真实世界MLRM模型（Kimi-VL、Ocean-R1、R1-Onevision）、六个跨三个领域的基准测试和四个基线方法上的评估显示，该方法平均提升5%，最高提升15%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著增强了现有多模态大推理模型的可靠性和可解释性，使其能够安全部署在高风险应用中。代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and
interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe
deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at

Additionally, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy to create

fine-tuning of our model. Our internal experiments (not applied to Airbnb
products) demonstrate that our approach of restructuring workflows and
fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data significantly enhances their performance,
setting a new benchmark for their application in customer support. Our solution
is not only cost-effective but also improves customer support, as evidenced by
both accuracy and manual processing time evaluation metrics.

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded
market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these
considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects
and data advantages accrue to early movers.

Motivation: 解决LLM幻觉问题并提升其可靠部署能力，需要有效的置信度估计方法。

Method: 通过多模型、多数据集、多提示的综合实验，分析推理轨迹长度作为置信度估计器的性能，并探究其机制。

Result: 推理轨迹长度在置信度估计方面表现良好，与口头表达置信度等方法相当但互补；推理后训练改变了轨迹长度与准确率的关系；高熵或"分叉"token在机制中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 推理后训练增强了不确定性量化能力，推理轨迹长度可作为大型推理模型的实用置信度度量指标。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

Method: 采用多代理系统，包括工作代理链处理EHR数据块，EHRMem长期记忆模块存储关键事件，以及管理代理综合信息进行预测。

Result: 在零样本一年期肺癌风险预测任务中，Traj-CoA优于四类基线方法，展现出临床对齐的时序推理能力。

Conclusion: Traj-CoA是建模复杂患者轨迹的稳健且可泛化的有前景方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling
patient trajectories, but suffer from the long and noisy nature of electronic
health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for
patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to
process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events
into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a
comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents'
summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a
zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR
data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that
Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a
promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient
trajectories.

Conclusion: 协作方法在不同医疗领域泛化良好，特别适用于远程医疗咨询和常规临床场景，同时提供可解释的决策路径

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image
analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect
diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation:
existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the
cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing
their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the
isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a
confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by
integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark,
DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and
treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\%
diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy,
outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This
collaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving
especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical
scenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.

Motivation: 推理模型通过增加计算资源来提高问题解决能力，但识别哪些推理路径可能成功是关键机会，可靠预测有效路径可以大幅减少计算浪费并提高整体效率。

Method: 引入Latent-Trajectory信号，通过测量推理开始和结束时潜在表征的总体变化、中间步骤累积的变化以及这些变化向最终状态推进的程度来预测解决方案准确性。

Result: Latent-Trajectory信号比跨层指标和基于输出的置信度测量更可靠地预测解决方案准确性。在指导多个采样生成的答案选择时，比多数投票更有效和高效，令牌使用减少高达70%，同时准确率平均提高2.6%。

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅为推理时效率提供了实用策略，还提供了关于推理过程如何在潜在空间中表示和区分的更深层次可解释性视角。

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

Method: 通过激励驱动的对抗性标注过程开发ELAIPBench基准，包含137篇论文的403个多选题，涵盖三个难度级别，强调非平凡推理而非浅层检索。

Result: 最佳性能LLM准确率仅39.95%，配备思维模式或RAG系统的前沿LLMs未能改善结果，甚至因过度思考或噪声检索而降低准确率。

Conclusion: 当前LLM能力与真正理解学术论文之间存在显著差距。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

Conclusion: 基于累积Jaccard指数的距离度量方法为随机置换集提供了一种有效且灵活的距离测量工具，具有重顶性特性，能够更好地处理有序结构的不确定信息。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

Result: 通过广泛实验验证了进化算法有效优化神经网络的能力，为计算资源有限的群体参与深度学习研究提供了可能。

Conclusion: 进化算法是训练大语言模型的有效替代方法，能显著降低计算成本，打破梯度优化方法的垄断地位。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

Method: 使用结合了提升方法和可解释性的自动分段线性回归(APLR)模型，并与几种最先进方法进行比较。

Result: APLR模型提供了最佳拟合，通过数值和可视化解释发现时间管理、专注能力、对同学的帮助性和线下课程参与对学习满意度有最显著的积极影响，而创意活动参与没有正面影响。

Conclusion: 贡献因素可以在个体层面进行解释，使教育者能够根据学生档案定制教学指导。

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern
techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not
been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear
regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction
among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型和数学优化的混合框架，用于在线叫车平台的供需平衡问题，无需训练数据，通过LLM作为元优化器生成语义启发式指导底层优化器，在纽约和芝加哥出租车数据集上相比现有方法平均提升16%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两类问题：强化学习方法数据效率低、对现实动态建模过于简化、难以强制执行操作约束；分解在线优化方法依赖手动设计的高层目标，缺乏对底层路由动态的认知。需要一种能结合两者优势的解决方案。

Method: 提出训练免费的混合框架，将LLM与数学优化集成在动态分层系统中：LLM作为元优化器生成语义启发式，指导负责约束执行和实时决策的底层优化器；通过和谐搜索驱动的闭环进化过程迭代优化LLM提示。

Result: 基于纽约和芝加哥出租车数据集的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进的基线方法平均提升了16%的性能。

Conclusion: 该混合框架成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过LLM与数学优化的结合，在无需大规模训练数据的情况下实现了更好的供需平衡效果。

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了UCAS方法，通过利用模型内部不确定性信号来改进强化学习中的信用分配，解决了现有方法在推理过程中对关键决策关注不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR算法如GRPO对所有token广播统一的优势信号，忽略了推理过程中不确定的高风险决策的关键作用，导致探索效率低下和熵崩溃问题。

Method: UCAS是一个无模型方法，通过两个阶段操作：首先使用模型的整体自信度调节响应级优势，然后基于原始logit确定性应用token级惩罚。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试上的广泛实验表明，UCAS显著优于强RLVR基线，在1.5B和7B等多个模型规模上都表现出色。

Conclusion: UCAS不仅获得更高奖励，还促进更大的推理多样性，并成功缓解了熵崩溃问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

Abstract: Generative Agentic AI systems are emerging as a powerful paradigm for
automating complex, multi-step tasks. However, many existing frameworks for
building these systems introduce significant complexity, a steep learning
curve, and substantial boilerplate code, hindering rapid prototyping and
deployment. This paper introduces simpliflow, a lightweight, open-source Python
framework designed to address these challenges. simpliflow enables the rapid
development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows
through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture
decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting
ease of use and extensibility. By integrating with LiteLLM, it supports over
100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture,
operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility
through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to
real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks
like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool
optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow
environments.

TL;DR: OmniVideoBench是一个大规模视频理解基准测试，专注于评估多模态大语言模型在音频-视觉协同推理方面的能力，包含1000个高质量问答对和13种问题类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法全面评估音频和视觉模态的协同推理能力，往往忽略其中一个模态或以逻辑不一致的方式整合它们。

Method: 构建包含1000个问答对的大规模基准测试，这些问答对来自628个多样化视频，每个都带有逐步推理痕迹，并经过人工验证确保正确性和独特性。

Result: 多个MLLM在OmniVideoBench上的评估显示，模型性能与人类推理之间存在显著差距，开源模型明显落后于闭源模型。

Conclusion: OmniVideoBench将促进开发具有更强、更可泛化推理能力的MLLM，突显了真正音频-视觉推理的内在难度。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: 传统推理演算基于二元归结，限制在成对子句交互，限制了多子句间的演绎协同。CSE框架提出了动态多子句推理理论，但其算法实现尚未形式化。

Method: 开发了扩展三角方法（ETM），在三角几何框架中统一多种矛盾构建策略，支持灵活的子句交互和动态协同，作为多个高性能定理证明器的核心算法。

Result: 基于ETM的定理证明器（CSE、CSE-E、CSI-E、CSI-Enig）在标准一阶基准测试（TPTP问题集和CASC 2018-2015）中取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: ETM将矛盾分离范式推进为通用、可扩展且具有实际竞争力的自动推理模型，为逻辑推理和定理证明的未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and
theorem proving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种自适应选择符号语言的方法来提升LLMs的逻辑推理性能，通过为不同自然语言问题选择最合适的符号语言形式化方法，显著优于单一符号语言翻译方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将自然语言问题翻译为符号语言时，只关注语义相似度，忽略了不同符号语言类型本身对特定逻辑推理问题的适用性差异。

Method: 利用LLMs为每个问题自适应选择最合适的符号语言（一阶逻辑、逻辑编程或布尔可满足性），然后翻译为对应符号语言表达式并使用相应的逻辑求解器得出答案。

Result: 在基准测试中，自适应选择方法显著优于单一符号语言翻译和随机选择方法。在混合数据集上达到96%准确率，比一阶逻辑翻译方法提升25%。

Conclusion: 不同自然语言逻辑推理问题对应不同的最优符号语言形式化方法，自适应选择目标符号语言能显著提升LLMs的逻辑推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning.
While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is
highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL)
problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个框架来评估大语言模型是否具备真正的战略思维能力，通过分析信念形成、行动评估和选择行为，发现前沿模型展现出信念一致的最佳响应行为，并表现出元推理和新型启发式规则形成的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估LLMs在均衡策略或推理深度方面的表现，但缺乏对其真正战略思维能力（包括信念形成、行动评估和基于信念的选择）的系统性研究。

Method: 开发了一个框架，在静态完全信息博弈中分离信念、评估和选择，通过分析模型的显性选择和推理轨迹，并引入新的无上下文游戏来排除记忆模仿的影响。

Result: 前沿模型在目标推理深度上展现出信念一致的最佳响应行为；在无约束情况下会自我限制推理深度，并对人类和合成对手形成差异化推测；在复杂性增加时，显式递归让位于内部生成的稳定、模型特定的启发式选择规则。

Conclusion: 信念一致性、元推理和新型启发式形成可以从语言建模目标中共同涌现，为研究人工智能体的战略认知提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在数学自动形式化中难以识别和利用先验数学知识的问题，传统检索方法因非正式陈述复杂且上下文有限而效果不佳

Method: 引入DRIFT框架：分解非正式数学陈述为更易处理的子组件，从数学库中针对性检索前提，并获取示例定理帮助模型更有效地使用前提

Result: 在多个基准测试中一致改进前提检索，ProofNet上F1分数相比DPR基线几乎翻倍；在分布外ConNF基准上表现强劲，GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1的BEq+@10分别提升37.14%和42.25%

Conclusion: 数学自动形式化中的检索效果高度依赖模型特定知识边界，需要与各模型能力对齐的自适应检索策略

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的MAC协议需要手动配置，而基于深度强化学习的协议虽然能提升性能，但泛化性和鲁棒性较差，需要昂贵的重新训练来适应动态环境。

Method: 将上行链路传输建模为动态多跟随者Stackelberg博弈，使用LLM驱动的智能体通过近端策略优化协调，合成自适应语义MAC协议，并采用协议动作语法确保可靠性。

Result: 仿真验证该框架相比传统基线实现了77.6%的吞吐量提升和65.2%的公平性改善，且能很好地泛化到变化的用户数量而无需重新训练。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合博弈论和LLM，成功解决了传统DRL协议泛化性差的问题，实现了高性能且自适应的MAC协议设计。

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

Conclusion: PaperArena为开发更强大的科学发现代理提供了评估基准，社区应采纳以推动进步。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

<details>

Motivation: 发现RAG代理存在工具调用劫持问题，即代理通过表面正确的工具调用虚增奖励信号，而不真正利用检索证据，导致模式崩溃和虚假接地。

Method: PoU框架通过统一的逐步合约实现，结合语法引用验证、基于扰动的敏感性奖励和答案-证据对齐目标，确保工具使用的可解释性和功能接地。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，PoU在事实准确性、证据忠实度和工具路由平衡方面持续优于DeepResearch基线，涵盖域内、域外和工具分布外设置。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在RL训练代理中不仅要在任务结果中接地，还要在检索信息的因果使用中接地，为可信的检索增强推理提供了原则性路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

### [275] [Video-STR: Reinforcing MLLMs in Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning with Relation Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10976)
*Wentao Wang,Heqing Zou,Tianze Luo,Rui Huang,Yutian Zhao,Zhuochen Wang,Hansheng Zhang,Chengwei Qin,Yan Wang,Lin Zhao,Huaijian Zhang*

TL;DR: Video-STR是一种基于图强化学习的视频时空推理方法，通过图分组相对策略优化来提升多模态大语言模型在精确时空理解方面的能力，并在STV-205k数据集上训练，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在语义理解方面表现良好，但在精确时空理解方面存在局限，特别是忽略了视频中的物理信息（如多物体布局和运动），这限制了在具身智能和VR等需要高精度应用中的使用。

Method: 提出基于图的强化学习方法Video-STR，利用可验证奖励的强化学习和图分组相对策略优化机制，引导模型在思考过程中推断场景的潜在时空拓扑结构。构建了包含20.5万个问答对的STV-205k数据集来支持模型训练。

Result: 实验表明Video-STR在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，在STI-Bench上比基础模型提升了13%，证明了该方法和数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: Video-STR通过图强化学习方法有效提升了多模态大语言模型的精确时空推理能力，为需要高精度时空理解的下游应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.
Code, model, and data will be released.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了模型插值的动态特性，为构建具有精确目标推理能力的模型提供了实用框架，证明了简单方法在模型融合中的潜力。

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在制造系统中，识别故障原因对维持和提高生产效率至关重要。基于知识的故障原因推断需要知识库能够明确结构化目标系统和故障知识，并包含足够长的故障因果链。

Method: 构建了诊断知识本体，并提出了基于功能-行为-结构(FBS)模型的维护记录积累方法。

Result: 使用该方法积累的维护记录进行故障原因推断，与专家枚举的候选原因集显示出更好的一致性，特别是在相关案例数量少、使用词汇不同的困难情况下。

Conclusion: 未来需要开发针对这些维护记录的推断方法，构建用户界面，并在更大更多样化的系统上进行验证。该方法有望成为整个工程链知识共享的基础。

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在法律环境中的不透明性对公平性、问责制和信任构成挑战，黑箱问题削弱了自动化决策的合法性，需要提供有意义的法律解释。

Method: 采用计算论证框架，分析不同解释策略的优缺点，评估其在法律推理中的适用性，强调论证框架能够捕捉法律的可废止性、可争议性和价值敏感性。

Result: 论证框架为可解释法律AI提供了特别稳健的基础，能够更好地满足技术和规范性透明度要求。

Conclusion: 计算论证最适合满足法律领域透明度的技术和规范要求，但仍需解决偏见缓解、司法环境实证验证等开放挑战。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
socio-economic systems are entering a new stage of "human-AI co-creation."
Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic
model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output
evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI
collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show
that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based
models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the
expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological
catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or
even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based
analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system
transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as
quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the
recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as
large language models and foundation models. Ensuring robust and reliable power
infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms
worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data
centre power management, has the potential to strongly improve the
sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental,
financial, and societal fields.

TL;DR: ARIA是一个基于规范驱动、人机协作的自动化可解释数据分析框架，通过自然语言规范定义分析目标，自动生成代码、验证计算并生成透明文档。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学数据的快速增长导致分析能力与研究意图之间存在差距，现有AI分析工具要么偏向自动化而牺牲透明度，要么依赖手动脚本阻碍可扩展性和可重复性。

Method: ARIA集成六个互操作层（命令、上下文、代码、数据、编排和AI模块），采用文档中心化工作流，通过自然语言规范让研究人员定义分析目标，系统自动生成可执行代码。

Result: 在波士顿房价案例中，ARIA发现了25个关键特征并确定XGBoost为最佳模型（R平方=0.93），过拟合最小。跨领域评估显示ARIA在性能、可解释性和效率方面优于最先进系统。

Conclusion: ARIA通过将AI研究原则与科学AI原则结合在规范驱动架构中，为透明、协作和可重复的科学发现建立了新范式。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical
capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from
AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over
transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and
reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a
spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data
analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,
Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow
that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language
specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously
generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent
documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly
identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant
tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA
discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model
(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous
domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for
science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new
paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了$How^{2}$记忆代理框架，使AI代理能够提问如何完成任务的问题、存储答案并在交互环境中重复使用以实现终身学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理在规划问题中需要通过回答"如何完成X"这类问题来减少不确定性并填补知识空白，但这类开放性问题对AI代理提问和AI专家回答都构成挑战。

Method: 在Minecraft制作环境中评估，使用不同抽象级别的教师模型回答问题，从可执行动作序列到高级子目标描述。

Result: 终身学习代理从与当前状态解耦的抽象答案中获益最大。

Conclusion: $How^{2}$为基于LLM的代理提供了一种通过在交互环境中提问来持续提升规划能力的方法。

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment (CDRA)方法，将LLM对齐重新定义为结构化推理过程，通过DeepPref基准和Pers-GenPRM模型解决用户深层偏好推断和防御性推理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐方法无法推断用户深层隐含偏好（包括未陈述的目标、语义上下文和风险容忍度），且缺乏应对现实世界模糊性的防御性推理能力，导致响应肤浅、脆弱和短视。

Method: 1. 引入DeepPref基准数据集（3000个偏好-查询对，涵盖20个主题），通过模拟多面认知委员会生成带有批判注释的推理链；2. 提出个性化生成过程奖励模型(Pers-GenPRM)，将奖励建模重构为个性化推理任务；3. 使用批判驱动策略对齐进行过程级在线强化学习。

Result: 实验证明CDRA在发现和适应用户真实偏好方面表现出色，同时执行稳健的推理。

Conclusion: CDRA通过结构化推理过程有效解决了LLM个性化对齐中的认知差距问题，提供了可解释的奖励信号和稳健的推理能力。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI对齐技术都有失效模式，防御深度策略依赖于不同技术失效模式的不相关性。如果所有技术有相同失效模式，防御深度将无法提供额外保护。

Method: 分析7种代表性对齐技术和7种失效模式，研究它们之间的重叠程度。

Result: 发现不同对齐技术的失效模式存在一定程度的重叠，但并非完全相关。

Conclusion: 防御深度策略在AI安全中具有一定价值，但需要谨慎评估技术间失效模式的相关性。研究结果为风险理解和研究优先级提供了重要参考。

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

TL;DR: PADME是一个基于图表示的智能代理框架，能够将自然语言程序文本转换为可执行图，实现长时程任务的自主执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能代理从自然语言（如食谱、科学协议等）自主执行长时程程序时的漂移和失败问题，这些自由形式指令的变异性强且缺乏结构。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：Teach阶段将程序文本结构化并丰富可执行逻辑，Execute阶段根据实时输入和环境反馈进行动态执行；通过图表示捕获任务依赖、决策点和可重用子程序。

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld等四个不同基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明了基于图表示的程序建模对可靠代理驱动自动化的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于图的程序表示为稳健和可泛化执行提供了强大的中间抽象，显著减少了长时程推理中的错误累积。

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural
language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form
instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows
encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure
cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during
execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent
framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of
procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or
unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into
executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable
subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which
focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of
procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in
response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures
quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once
and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also
provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon
reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for
reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.
These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure
representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and
generalizable execution.

Conclusion: AAS为从"经验时代"迈向"模拟时代"提供了基础性支撑，通过生成高质量模拟数据推动教育系统研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

Method: 构建标准化流程（提示生成→归一化→本体对齐），提出语义F1分数（基于嵌入匹配评估内容准确性）和层次感知F1分数（评估结构正确性），比较零样本和防泄露少样本提示策略。

Result: 零样本提供强基线，少样本能稳定措辞和粒度并改善层次对齐；延迟分析显示引导式提示有时比零样本更快，因为生成更符合模式。

Conclusion: 该框架、基准和指标为开发忠实于本体的技能分解系统提供了可复现的基础。

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language
Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework.
Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to
normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we
introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

Abstract: Anemia, a condition marked by insufficient levels of red blood cells or
hemoglobin, remains a widespread health issue affecting millions of individuals
globally. Accurate and timely diagnosis is essential for effective management
and treatment of anemia. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in
the use of artificial intelligence techniques, i.e., machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) for the detection, classification, and diagnosis of anemia.
This paper provides a systematic review of the recent advancements in this
field, with a focus on various models applied to anemia detection. The review
also compares these models based on several performance metrics, including
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. By analyzing these metrics,
the paper evaluates the strengths and limitation of discussed models in
detecting and classifying anemia, emphasizing the importance of addressing
these factors to improve diagnostic accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了维度级奖励模型（DRM），通过三个可解释维度（置信度、相关性、连贯性）来评估推理过程质量，解决了传统结果监督强化学习和过程级奖励模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的结果监督强化学习只奖励最终正确答案，容易传播错误推理且奖励信号稀疏；过程级奖励模型虽然提供更密集的反馈，但缺乏泛化性和可解释性，需要任务特定的推理过程分割。

Method: 提出维度级奖励模型（DRM），从三个基本维度评估推理过程：置信度（不确定性校准）、相关性（语义对齐）、连贯性（逻辑一致性），无需真实答案即可进行可解释评估。

Result: 实验结果表明DRM提供有效的监督信号，指导LLM优化并增强其推理能力。在数学、问答、代码执行和谜题等开放领域任务上，DRM监督训练在分布内和分布外都取得一致增益。

Conclusion: 多维度的推理过程监督可以提升LLM在训练分布之外的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain
tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.
Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the
training distribution.

TL;DR: DARK是一个统一的知识图谱推理框架，同时支持演绎和溯因推理，通过掩码扩散模型捕获查询与结论的双向关系，在两种推理任务上都达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识图谱推理方法将演绎推理和溯因推理分开处理，但两者具有明显的协同潜力：演绎可以验证假设，溯因可以发现更深层的逻辑模式。为了弥合这一差距，需要统一的推理框架。

Method: 提出DARK框架，采用掩码扩散模型：1）自反思去噪过程，在溯因推理中迭代生成和验证候选假设；2）逻辑探索强化学习方法，同时掩码查询和结论，探索新的推理组合。

Result: 在多个基准知识图谱上的广泛实验表明，DARK在演绎和溯因推理任务上都实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 统一处理演绎和溯因推理的方法具有显著优势，DARK框架通过双向建模查询与结论关系，有效提升了知识图谱推理能力。

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing
knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to
scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves
retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

Abstract: Governance of data, compliance, and business privacy matters, particularly
for healthcare and finance businesses. Since the recent emergence of AI
enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private
data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants
across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing
zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI

for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution
is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such
systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of
commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this
arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct
technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce
AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing
much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this
paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data
retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models
service providers like Open Ai, Anthropic, and Meta.

TL;DR: 提出了CC-Gen基准测试生成器和CAP-CPT方法，用于解决LLM代理系统中政策文档内部化问题，通过可控复杂度评估和政策分类持续预训练，显著减少提示长度并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理系统中的政策文档随着需求增长而快速扩展，导致高计算开销，需要开发将政策文档嵌入模型先验的内部化方法。

Method: 引入CC-Gen基准生成器（可控四个复杂度级别），并提出CAP-CPT方法：自动解析政策文档提取关键规范，分为事实性、行为性和条件性类别，通过自回归预训练损失实现政策内部化。

Result: CAP-CPT在所有设置中均优于SFT基线，在Qwen-3-32B上提升达41%和22%，在CC-Gen上实现97.3%的提示长度减少，并增强tau-Bench性能。

Conclusion: CAP-CPT方法有效缓解了数据和推理负担，通过分类感知的政策持续预训练成功实现了政策信息的内部化。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy
documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these
documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates
developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model
priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets
generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels
and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce
CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four
levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity
and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our
analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose
major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent
interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy
complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose
Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline
parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into
factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex
conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis
and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive
pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all
settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt
length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI政策制定者面临信息环境中信噪比过低的问题，这导致监管捕获和风险优先级的不确定性，削弱了制定有效政策的能力。

Method: 通过评估其他科学领域的复现性危机，提出在AI研究中采用预注册、提高统计功效和发表阴性结果的复现性协议。

Result: 论文认为这些复现性协议能够改善AI风险格局的共识，为有效的AI治理提供支持。

Conclusion: 虽然AI治理必须保持反应性，但政策制定者应将复现性协议视为治理工具箱的核心工具，并要求AI研究达到更高标准。

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance
mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development.
However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised
by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and
creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from
a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI
combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility
protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful
policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt
stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve
consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility
crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific
domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased
statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can
enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be
reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that
policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core
tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

TL;DR: 提出一个结合可解释AI、生存分析和RFM分析的三组件框架，用于客户流失分析，旨在从单纯预测转向制定个性化保留策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线零售中客户获取成本高于保留成本，但现有流失模型多为黑箱，缺乏对流失原因、干预时机和高风险客户群体的洞察。

Method: 集成可解释AI量化特征贡献、生存分析建模流失风险时间、RFM分析按交易行为细分客户的三组件框架。

Result: 能够识别流失驱动因素、估计干预时间窗口、优先处理需要针对性行动的客户细分群体。

Conclusion: 该框架支持减少客户流失和增强客户忠诚度的策略制定，将重点从预测转向基于可解释证据的个性化保留策略设计。

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

Motivation: 现有智能体基准主要关注任务完成度，但忽视了并行和异步操作的时间效率，需要专门评估多智能体系统的并行规划能力。

Method: 基于Overcooked游戏设计ParaCook环境，提供简化的动作空间来专注于并行战略规划的核心挑战，建立可扩展的评估框架。

Result: 当前最先进的LLMs在ParaCook上表现不佳，生成的计划在并行动作和协调方面存在困难，但在抽象任务上显示出并行优化的潜力。

Conclusion: ParaCook为开发和评估时间效率感知的多智能体规划提供了基础，揭示了LLMs在并行规划方面的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous
operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for
time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,
establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware
multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.
