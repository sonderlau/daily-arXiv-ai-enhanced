Rare event sampling (RES) and ensemble boosting\noffer a novel strategy to extract more information from those occasional\nsimulated events: small perturbations in advance can turn a moderate event into\na severe one, which otherwise might not come for many more simulation-years.\nBut how to choose this ``advance split time'' (AST) remains a challenge for\nsudden, transient events like precipitation. In this work, we formulate a\nconcrete optimization problem for the AST and instantiate it on an idealized\nbut physically informative model system: a quasigeostrophic turbulent channel\nflow advecting a passive tracer, which captures key elements of midlatitude\nstorm track dynamics. Three major questions guide our investigation: (1) Can\nRES methods, in particular \\emph{ensemble boosting} and \\emph{trying-early\nadaptive multilevel splitting}, accurately sample extreme events of return\nperiods longer than the simulation time? (2) What is the optimal AST, and how\ndoes it depend on the definition of the extreme event, in particular the target\nlocation? (3) Can the AST be optimized ``online'' while running RES?\n  Our answers are tentatively positive. (1) RES can meaningfully improve tail\nestimation, using (2) an optimal AST of 1-3 eddy turnover timescales, which\nvaries weakly but detectably with target location. (3) A certain functional\nthat we call the \\emph{thresholded entropy} successfully picks out near-optimal\nASTs, eliminating the need for arbitrary thresholds that have thus far hindered\nRES methods.

However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have\nrarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained\nquantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for\nmultiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in\nImage Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics,\nContent, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains\n40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we\ndevelop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various\ndimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I\nand I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to\ngenerate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among\nmodel-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently\nprovides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for\neach type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's\ndimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to\nenhance overall performance.

This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the \"hard systematicity\nchallenge.\" However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be\nregulated by the rationales for systematization.

Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade\ngliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose\ndiagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation\noffers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across\nheterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A\nretrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,\nmedulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI\nsequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual\nannotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),\nT2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D\nnnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation\nperformance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared\nagainst intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust\nperformance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator\nvariability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean\nDSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by\ntumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2\nalone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL\nis feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and\nCC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement.

Our key contribution lies in the integration\nof handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our\nmodel to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features\nfrom retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark\ndatasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for\nGlaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates\nconsistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for\nbinary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the\nIC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\\% accuracy, 94.8\\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,\noutperforming several state-of-the-art models.

However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are\noften constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant\nchallenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although\nincorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial\ndomain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner\nhardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain\ntransferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain\nAdaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA\nleverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with\neach branch comprising an encoder and a classifier.

However, harnessing\nthe power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires\nformulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the\nadvent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to\nautomatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus\nbridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated\narchitecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about\nthe relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in\nmanufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we\nevaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate\ninformation retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,\nparticularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core\nInformation Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding\nrelevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in\ntransforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that\nLLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and\ncomplete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema.

A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution\nusing the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of\ngenerative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent\nstochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their\neffectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed\nmethod leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based\ngenerative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate\nsegmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling\nmultiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose\npixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This\nsampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,\noffering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive\nsegmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper\ninsights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes.

Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental\nflaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic\nfeatures. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained\ninformation due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,\nmemory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly\ncapture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise\npredictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical\nmemory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for\nmemory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic\ninformation. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel\nand semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism\nto perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their\ninherent feature discrepancies.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored\nspecifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service\nrobots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and\n46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.\nParticipants performed various human actions in diverse environments at\ndistances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,\nsimulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights\ndue to uneven ground.

OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,\nleading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised\nsetting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot\nsetting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching\nchallenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by\nthe classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we\nshow that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD\ndetection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD\ncombines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a\nspecific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier\ntrained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is\nmodular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus\nintroduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.\nWe evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also\nconsider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label\nnoise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been\npreviously overlooked.

However, despite\ntheir acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences\noriginating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture\nof the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,\nevent cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a\nunified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point\ncorrespondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By\nformulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a\nconstant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence\nrelation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D\npoints with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its\ngeneral formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing\nmodalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can\neven combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the\neffectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we\nshow consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent\napproaches.

Studying AAA progression and\nrupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged\nwall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD\nsimulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,\ngeometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been\nproposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a\nfew seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to\nestimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to\ncommon factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep\nlearning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective\ngeometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a\ndataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are\nextracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are\nobtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,\nas well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately\nestimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary\nconditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to\ndifferent artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added\nduring inference.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a\nself-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we\npretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of\nlinearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable\nimage file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of\nartificial face manipulations.

While recent large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely\nsolely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing\nspatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in\npractice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or\nmockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that\nperforms UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,\nplanning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to\ndetect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical\nlayout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces\nHTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves\nrobustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that\nautomatically produces large-scale image-code pairs.

To extend the\nboundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose\nOmnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset\ncontaining 2,098 videos and 59,458 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS\nstands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions\nthat flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on\nunderstanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the\ninclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore,\nwe introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the\nchallenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of\naudiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and\nperform reasoning-based segmentation. Extensive experiments show that OISA\noutperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on\nother related tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniAVS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b2,098\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u548c59,458\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53c2\u8003\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u652f\u63018\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u5bf9\u97f3\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u3002OISA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u5272\uff08RAVS\uff09\u5728\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0cOmniAVS\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOmniAVS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cOmnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant\uff08OISA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528MLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "OISA\u5728OmniAVS\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniAVS\u548cOISA\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u5272\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}
