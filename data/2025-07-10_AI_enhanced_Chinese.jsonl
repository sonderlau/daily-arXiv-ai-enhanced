Here, we show\nthat conditions frequently arise in coastal marine settings where these\nassumptions do not hold. Using flux measurements from the Coastal Land-Air-Sea\nInteraction (CLASI) project's Air-Sea Interaction Spar (ASIS) buoys with wind\nand flux measurements at typically ~3m and ~5m above the sea surface, we find\nthat wind speed decreases with height in nearly 20% of observations, and that\nlarge vertical gradients in sensible heat flux occur near the surface, contrary\nto what would be predicted by MOST. Both anomalies are strongly modulated by\ncoastal proximity and wind direction, with the highest occurrence rates near\nshore under offshore winds. These patterns were found using the Discovery\nEngine, a general-purpose automated system for scientific discovery, which\nidentifies complex relationships in data without prior hypotheses. The\nDiscovery Engine uncovered three distinct mechanisms responsible for breakdowns\nin MOST assumptions: internal boundary layers formed by offshore continental\nflow, wave-driven wind jets associated with high wave age, and thermally stable\nboundary layers over cold sea surfaces where warm, moist air overlies cooler\nwater far from shore.

Above all, to develop a\nperception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual\nperception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model\nis leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the\nquality of underwater images.

Hosseini"], "title": "SPARC: Concept-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders for Cross-Model and Cross-Modal Interpretability", "comment": null, "summary": "Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts,\nsuch as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically\nproduces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods\nlike Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each\nmodel, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model\ninterpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for\nAligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,\nunified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,\nvision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is\nenforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,\nensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given\nconcept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages\nsemantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically\nimproves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than\ntripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared\nsparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar\nhigh-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of\nhow different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring\nmanual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned\nrepresentation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided\nspatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal\nretrieval.

In the domain of wildland fire science, this\nchallenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets\nwith labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data\nAugmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of\ndeep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving\nsegmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)\nidentify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization\ntechnique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined\nfire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity\nwhile preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The\neffectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical\nanalysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a\nweighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps\nelevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which\ncarries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,\nash, or background).

This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging\nof behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However,\ncontinuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant\npower impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video\ndata for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial\ncomputational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time\nadaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal\nsensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use\nlow-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches\nfrom one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling\nrate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during\nperiods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the\nhand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in\neach RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part\nof the image for activity recognition.

Compared to existing surveys that focus on isolated domains, our\ntaxonomy categorizes attention-worthy traffic entities into two main groups\nthat are anomalies and normal but critical entities, integrating ten categories\nand twenty subclasses. It establishes connections between inherently related\nfields and provides a unified analytical framework. Our survey highlights the\nanalysis of 35 vision-driven tasks and comprehensive examinations and\nvisualizations of 73 available datasets based on the proposed taxonomy. The\ncross-domain investigation covers the pros and cons of each benchmark with the\naim of providing information on standards unification and resource\noptimization. Our article concludes with a systematic discussion of the\nexisting weaknesses, underlining the potential effects and promising solutions\nfrom various perspectives. The integrated taxonomy, comprehensive analysis, and\nrecapitulatory tables serve as valuable contributions to this rapidly evolving\nfield by providing researchers with a holistic overview, guiding strategic\nresource selection, and highlighting critical research gaps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5143\u7d20\u5206\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u6b63\u5e38\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e8635\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u9a71\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u548c73\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9053\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4ea4\u901a\u5b9e\u4f53\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\uff08\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u6b63\u5e38\u4f46\u5173\u952e\uff09\uff0c\u6574\u540810\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u548c20\u4e2a\u5b50\u7c7b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e8635\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c73\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u8d44\u6e90\u9009\u62e9\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

Then, we use a MarianMT machine\ntranslation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)\ngloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without\ngrammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.\nTo make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such\nas Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the\ntranslated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on\nSign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key\npoints from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss\ntranslation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which\nturns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss\nusing grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly\ninterpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations.

CDR-CA aims\nto refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the\napplication's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a\nsimple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)\nto multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified\nsimilarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent\nNormalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.

Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently\nfactorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static\nand foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,\ncapturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the\nmodern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a\nfixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different\nfuture environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust\ninitial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of\nsurrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes\nILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)\nattention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an\ninverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,\nintroducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal\ncoordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture\ncomplex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to\nextract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost\nno increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion\nforecasting datasets.

In addition to being highly\nimperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several\nstate-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.", "AI": {"tldr": "IAP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u611f\u77e5\u611f\u77e5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u4eba\u7c7b\u6216\u81ea\u52a8\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u3002", "method": "IAP\u7ed3\u5408\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5730\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u8865\u4e01\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u611f\u77e5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5bf9\u6297\u635f\u5931\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "result": "IAP\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7ed5\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "IAP\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Most existing methods use equally\npenalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less\ndiscriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly\nambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually\nannotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points\nwould lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design\nAMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity\nestimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points\nbased on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,\nwhich ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes\nfor high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position\ndiscrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by\nthe assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking\nambiguity awareness.

The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a\nrich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature,\nand principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make\navailable, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical\nCAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training\nand testing.

Preprint version", "summary": "Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by\nleveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration\nproblem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a\ndenoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions\nbetween these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In\nthis paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and\nidentify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts\nbetween the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal\nfluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these\ninstabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration\nperformance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive\nGradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD\nintegrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up\nstrategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum\n(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD\nsignificantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art\nperformance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner\nincorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical\nfeature field. This field represents language and instance features using\ndistilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM).

In this work, we\nintroduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images\nfrom an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into\nexisting thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and\norientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the\nbackground. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object\ncategories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the\nHIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating\nthese datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across\nboth new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new\napplications.

However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color\nspace-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due\nto the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)\ncolor space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red\nand black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color\nspace for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV\ncolor map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances\nfor the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable\nintensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.\nAdditionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+\n(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and\nmitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+\nleverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light\nimages using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel\nPrior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can\npromote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color\ncorrection, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the\nmeticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we\nconstruct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for\ninformation-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions,\nensuring accurate brightness adjustments.

It consists of a deep learning model trained on satellite imagery\nto identify palm trees, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify palm\nclusters, which are then used to estimate ancient management areas. To assess\nthe palm distribution in relation to past human activity, we applied the\nproposed approach to unique high-resolution satellite imagery data covering 765\nkm2 of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. With this work, we also\nrelease a manually annotated palm tree dataset along with estimated locations\nof archaeological sites from ground-surveys and legacy records. Results\ndemonstrate how palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological\nsites showing large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm\ncluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major\ninfrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated\nby archaeological evidence alone. Our findings suggest that pre-Columbian\npopulations influenced local vegetation fostering conditions conducive to palm\nproliferation, leaving a lasting ecological footprint. This may have lowered\nthe logistical costs of establishing infrastructure-heavy settlements in\notherwise less accessible locations.

However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete\npanoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation\npipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing\nstreet view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration\ncapabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing\ndatasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation.

Additionally, to achieve the controllable\ngeneration of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method\n(PPM).

Yet, their effectiveness\nin practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional\nchanges, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.\nTherefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the\nuse of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample\npredictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA\nmethods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or\nmake unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and\ntest data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and\nuniversally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the\nflexibility of TTA.

Therefore, we conduct the first study of\nLiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present\na novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under\nadverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception\ncapabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due\nto the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed.

However, in cross-modal\nsettings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges\ndue to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the\ncomplementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This\npaper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:\ndistillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,\nwe propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework\nfeaturing a mixture of specialized teachers.
