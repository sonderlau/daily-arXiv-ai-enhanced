### [1] [Reinitializing weights vs units for maintaining plasticity in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00212)
*J. Fernando Hernandez-Garcia,Shibhansh Dohare,Jun Luo,Rich S. Sutton*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文比较了两种防止神经网络失去可塑性的方法：重新初始化单元和重新初始化权重，并提出了一种新的选择性权重重新初始化算法。实验表明，在特定情况下（如网络单元较少或包含层归一化时），重新初始化权重更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在长时间训练非平稳数据时失去可塑性的问题，设计持续学习系统。

Method: 提出选择性权重重新初始化算法，并与持续反向传播和ReDo算法进行比较。

Result: 在单元较少或包含层归一化的网络中，重新初始化权重更有效；在网络足够大且无层归一化时，两种方法效果相当。

Conclusion: 重新初始化权重在更广泛的情况下能保持网络的可塑性。

Abstract: Loss of plasticity is a phenomenon in which a neural network loses its
ability to learn when trained for an extended time on non-stationary data. It
is a crucial problem to overcome when designing systems that learn continually.
An effective technique for preventing loss of plasticity is reinitializing
parts of the network. In this paper, we compare two different reinitialization
schemes: reinitializing units vs reinitializing weights. We propose a new
algorithm, which we name \textit{selective weight reinitialization}, for
reinitializing the least useful weights in a network. We compare our algorithm
to continual backpropagation and ReDo, two previously proposed algorithms that
reinitialize units in the network. Through our experiments in continual
supervised learning problems, we identify two settings when reinitializing
weights is more effective at maintaining plasticity than reinitializing units:
(1) when the network has a small number of units and (2) when the network
includes layer normalization. Conversely, reinitializing weights and units are
equally effective at maintaining plasticity when the network is of sufficient
size and does not include layer normalization. We found that reinitializing
weights maintains plasticity in a wider variety of settings than reinitializing
units.

*Piotr Urbańczyk,Aleksandra Urbańczyk,Magdalena Król,Leszek Rutkowski,Marek Kisiel-Dorohinicki*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了结合PSO和GA的混合进化-群体元启发式算法，并引入了一种新型连续混合PSO-GA算法，通过信息传递机制提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究混合PSO和GA的算法，以提升在高维搜索空间中的收敛性和一致性。

Method: 采用顺序、并行和连续的混合方式，并在新型算法中通过修改GA的变异算子实现信息传递。

Result: 实验结果表明，混合方法在多个基准函数上表现优于标准算法，尤其在更高维度。

Conclusion: 混合算法，特别是新型连续PSO-GA算法，在高维问题中具有显著优势。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is twofold. First, it explores hybrid
evolutionary-swarm metaheuristics that combine the features of PSO and GA in a
sequential, parallel and consecutive manner in comparison with their standard
basic form: Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization. The algorithms
were tested on a set of benchmark functions, including Ackley, Griewank, Levy,
Michalewicz, Rastrigin, Schwefel, and Shifted Rotated Weierstrass, across
multiple dimensions. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid
approaches achieve superior convergence and consistency, especially in
higher-dimensional search spaces. The second goal of this paper is to introduce
a novel consecutive hybrid PSO-GA evolutionary algorithm that ensures
continuity between PSO and GA steps through explicit information transfer
mechanisms, specifically by modifying GA's variation operators to inherit
velocity and personal best information.

### [3] [Evolutionary Generative Optimization: Towards Fully Data-Driven Evolutionary Optimization via Generative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00380)
*Kebin Sun,Tao Jiang,Ran Cheng,Yaochu Jin,Kay Chen Tan*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: EvoGO是一个基于生成学习的数据驱动进化算法框架，通过三个阶段（数据准备、模型训练和种群生成）实现高效优化，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的进化算法仍依赖人工启发式方法，限制了其通用性和自动化。EvoGO旨在通过生成学习解决这一问题。

Method: EvoGO分为三个阶段：数据准备（构建配对数据集）、模型训练（生成模型学习优化解）、种群生成（替代传统繁殖操作）。

Result: 实验表明，EvoGO在10代内收敛，并在数值基准、控制问题和机器人任务中显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: EvoGO展示了数据驱动进化算法的潜力，提供了一种高效且通用的优化框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have
demonstrated the potential of leveraging data to improve optimization accuracy
and adaptability. Nevertheless, most existing approaches remain dependent on
handcrafted heuristics, which limits their generality and automation. To
address this challenge, we propose Evolutionary Generative Optimization
(EvoGO), a fully data-driven framework empowered by generative learning. EvoGO
streamlines the evolutionary optimization process into three stages: data
preparation, model training, and population generation. The data preparation
stage constructs a pairwise dataset to enrich training diversity without
incurring additional evaluation costs. During model training, a tailored
generative model learns to transform inferior solutions into superior ones. In
the population generation stage, EvoGO replaces traditional reproduction
operators with a scalable and parallelizable generative mechanism. Extensive
experiments on numerical benchmarks, classical control problems, and
high-dimensional robotic tasks demonstrate that EvoGO consistently converges
within merely 10 generations and significantly outperforms a wide spectrum of
optimization approaches, including traditional EAs, Bayesian optimization, and
reinforcement learning based methods. Source code will be made publicly
available.

### [4] [STF: Shallow-Level Temporal Feedback to Enhance Spiking Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00387)
*Zeqi Zheng,Zizheng Zhu,Yingchao Yu,Yanchen Huang,Changze Lv,Junfeng Tang,Zhaofei Yu,Yaochu Jin*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的浅层时间反馈模块（STF），用于提升基于Transformer的脉冲神经网络（SNN）在静态数据集上的性能，同时降低计算成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度级反馈设计虽然能提升SNN性能，但带来了高计算成本、参数开销和延迟问题，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了STF模块，包含时空位置嵌入（TSPE）和时间反馈（TF），用于编码层，以增强脉冲模式的多样性。

Result: 实验表明，STF在多种Transformer-based SNN骨干网络上显著提升了性能，同时增强了对抗鲁棒性和时间敏感性。

Conclusion: STF是一种高效且通用的脉冲编码方案，适用于静态场景，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Transformer-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) suffer from a great
performance gap compared to floating-point Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
due to the binary nature of spike trains. Recent efforts have introduced
deep-level feedback loops to transmit high-level semantic information to narrow
this gap. However, these designs often span multiple deep layers, resulting in
costly feature transformations, higher parameter overhead, increased energy
consumption, and longer inference latency. To address this issue, we propose
Shallow-level Temporal Feedback (STF), a lightweight plug-and-play module for
the encoding layer, which consists of Temporal-Spatial Position Embedding
(TSPE) and Temporal Feedback (TF).Extensive experiments show that STF
consistently improves performance across various Transformer-based SNN
backbones on static datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K,
under different spike timestep settings. Further analysis reveals that STF
enhances the diversity of the spike patterns, which is key to performance gain.
Moreover, evaluations on adversarial robustness and temporal sensitivity
confirm that STF outperforms direct coding and its variants, highlighting its
potential as a new spike encoding scheme for static scenarios. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

### [5] [A Quality-Guided Mixture of Score-Fusion Experts Framework for Human Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00053)
*Jie Zhu,Yiyang Su,Minchul Kim,Anil Jain,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为QME的新型框架，通过可学习的分数融合策略提升全身生物识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法忽略了各模态分数分布的差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: 采用专家混合（MoE）策略，引入伪质量损失和分数三元组损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: QME有效解决了多模态和多模型中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Whole-body biometric recognition is a challenging multimodal task that
integrates various biometric modalities, including face, gait, and body. This
integration is essential for overcoming the limitations of unimodal systems.
Traditionally, whole-body recognition involves deploying different models to
process multiple modalities, achieving the final outcome by score-fusion (e.g.,
weighted averaging of similarity matrices from each model). However, these
conventional methods may overlook the variations in score distributions of
individual modalities, making it challenging to improve final performance. In
this work, we present \textbf{Q}uality-guided \textbf{M}ixture of score-fusion
\textbf{E}xperts (QME), a novel framework designed for improving whole-body
biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy
using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for
quality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score
triplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on
multiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics
compared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and
multi-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the
similarity score domain and variability in data quality.

### [6] [Punching Bag vs. Punching Person: Motion Transferability in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00085)
*Raiyaan Abdullah,Jared Claypoole,Michael Cogswell,Ajay Divakaran,Yogesh Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了动作识别模型在跨多样上下文中的高级运动概念迁移能力，发现模型在新颖情境下性能显著下降，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估动作识别模型在未见过的高级别动作变体（如“打人”）中的泛化能力，并探索其迁移性能。

Method: 方法包括引入三个数据集（Syn-TA、Kinetics400-TA、Something-Something-v2-TA），评估13种先进模型，并分析其性能表现。

Result: 结果显示模型在新颖情境下性能显著下降，多模态模型在细粒度动作上表现更差，大模型在空间主导任务中表现更好但时间推理能力不足。

Conclusion: 结论认为研究为动作识别中的运动迁移性评估提供了重要基准，并建议通过解耦粗粒度与细粒度运动来改进性能。

Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they
effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even
within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad
action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching
person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with
three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)
Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural
video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and
observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions
in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more
with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free
Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing
greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve
transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal
reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization.
We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve
recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study
establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action
recognition. Datasets and relevant code:

### [7] [The Monado SLAM Dataset for Egocentric Visual-Inertial Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00088)
*Mateo de Mayo,Daniel Cremers,Taihú Pire*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了Monado SLAM数据集，旨在解决现有VIO/SLAM系统在头戴设备使用场景中的挑战性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉惯性里程计（VIO）和SLAM系统在头戴设备使用场景中表现不佳，如高动态运动、遮挡等问题未被充分解决。

Method: 通过收集多个虚拟现实头戴设备的真实序列数据，构建Monado SLAM数据集。

Result: 发布了Monado SLAM数据集，采用CC BY 4.0许可，以推动VIO/SLAM研究。

Conclusion: Monado SLAM数据集填补了现有研究的空白，有助于解决头戴设备使用中的实际问题。

Abstract: Humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets benefit from the use of
head-mounted sensors for tracking. While advancements in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced
new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are
still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in
the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions,
dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse
lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be
covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may
inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we
present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple
virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0
license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.

### [8] [Exploring the Feasibility of Deep Learning Techniques for Accurate Gender Classification from Eye Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00135)
*Basna Mohammed Salih Hasan,Ramadhan J. Mstafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的模型，利用眼周区域的颜色图像进行性别分类，在CVBL和（Female and Male）数据集上分别达到99%和96%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性别分类在安全、人机交互等领域至关重要，但化妆品和伪装等因素会影响分类准确性。研究专注于眼周区域，因其包含丰富的视觉特征。

Method: 采用CNN模型，利用颜色图像数据库提取眼周区域的关键特征，并在两个数据集上进行测试。

Result: 模型在CVBL数据集上达到99%的准确率，在（Female and Male）数据集上达到96%的准确率，参数数量较少（7,235,089）。

Conclusion: 模型性能优异，适用于安全和监控等实际应用。

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields,
including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising.
Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors
such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to
addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color
images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area
surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between
them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features
for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the
effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate
the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL
and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding
accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a
commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters
(7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of
our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we
evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it
with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate
the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical
application in domains such as security and surveillance.

### [9] [World Consistency Score: A Unified Metric for Video Generation Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00144)
*Akshat Rakheja,Aarsh Ashdhir,Aryan Bhattacharjee,Vanshika Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World Consistency Score (WCS) 是一种新的生成视频模型评估指标，强调视频的内部世界一致性，通过四个可解释的子指标（对象持久性、关系稳定性、因果合规性和闪烁惩罚）综合计算，并与人类判断对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频评估指标主要关注视觉保真度或提示对齐，忽略了视频中时间与物理一致性的重要性。WCS旨在填补这一空白，提供更全面的评估框架。

Method: WCS结合四个子指标，通过开源工具（如跟踪器、动作识别器、CLIP嵌入和光流）计算，并使用人类偏好数据训练权重。实验验证包括与人类评估的相关性测试、敏感性分析及与其他指标（如FVD、CLIPScore）的对比。

Result: WCS提供了一个可解释且全面的框架，能够有效评估视频生成模型在维持时间与物理一致性方面的表现。

Conclusion: WCS通过整合多个子指标和人类偏好数据，为生成视频模型的世界一致性评估提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce World Consistency Score (WCS), a novel unified evaluation metric
for generative video models that emphasizes internal world consistency of the
generated videos. WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object
permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each
measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video.
These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a
single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the
motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics,
formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools
(trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how
the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We
also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like
VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human
evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against
established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a
comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation
models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing
gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.

### [10] [GeoExplorer: Active Geo-localization with Curiosity-Driven Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00152)
*Li Mi,Manon Bechaz,Zeming Chen,Antoine Bosselut,Devis Tuia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoExplorer提出了一种基于好奇心驱动的探索方法，用于主动地理定位任务，提高了在陌生目标和环境中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于距离奖励的强化学习方法在距离估计困难或面对陌生目标时表现不佳，缺乏可靠的探索策略。

Method: GeoExplorer通过引入好奇心驱动的内在奖励，实现目标无关的多样化探索，并结合有效的环境建模。

Result: 在四个AGL基准测试中，GeoExplorer表现出色，尤其在陌生目标和环境中的定位能力显著提升。

Conclusion: 好奇心驱动的探索策略显著提升了AGL任务的鲁棒性和泛化能力，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented
in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text),
within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a
goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward.
They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance
from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when
encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced
robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration
strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL
agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards.
Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic,
enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on
effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through
extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings,
particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

### [11] [Robust 3D Object Detection using Probabilistic Point Clouds from Single-Photon LiDARs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00169)
*Bhavya Goyal,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Wei Lin,Andreas Velten,Yin Li,Mohit Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为概率点云（PPC）的新3D场景表示方法，通过为每个点添加概率属性来封装原始数据中的测量不确定性，从而提升3D物体检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LiDAR在远距离或低反光物体等场景中会产生稀疏或错误的点云，这些误差会传播到下游感知模型，导致精度下降。传统3D处理流程未保留原始测量中的不确定性信息。

Method: 提出了PPC，为点云中的每个点添加概率属性，并设计了基于PPC的推理方法，可作为轻量级模块集成到3D推理流程中。

Result: 通过仿真和实际数据验证，PPC方法在室内外场景中优于LiDAR及相机-LiDAR融合模型，尤其在处理小、远、低反光物体及强环境光时表现突出。

Conclusion: PPC通过显式建模不确定性，显著提升了3D物体检测的鲁棒性，适用于多种挑战性场景。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation
used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in
several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects,
producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in
the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception
models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because
conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information
from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds.
  We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation
where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates
the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further
introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object
detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally
lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both
simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform
several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across
challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and
low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

*David Restrepo,Ira Ktena,Maria Vakalopoulou,Stergios Christodoulidis,Enzo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种选择性模态转移（SMS）方法，用于量化视觉语言模型（VLMs）在二元分类任务中对不同模态的依赖，发现模型偏向文本信息而忽视视觉线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需要结合医学图像和临床报告，但现有VLMs常偏向单一模态（尤其是文本），可能忽视关键的视觉信息。

Method: 通过选择性模态转移（SMS），在二元分类任务中交换样本的图像或文本，量化模型对模态的依赖，并在两个医学影像数据集上评估了六种VLMs。

Result: 发现模型普遍依赖文本输入，即使视觉信息具有互补性；注意力分析进一步证实图像内容常被文本细节掩盖。

Conclusion: 设计多模态医学模型时需真正整合视觉和文本信息，而非依赖单一模态信号。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images
and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can
offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward
one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual
information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a
perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in
binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between
samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six
open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on
two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray)
and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance
and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings,
we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the
presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative
attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often
overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of
designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate
visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决在机器学习和计算科学中，如何高效地构建层次化模型架构，并支持多尺度分析和操作的需求。

Method: 方法包括定义层次化增长的图谱系，引入延长映射和骨架操作（如乘积构造、加厚和升级），并构建代数类型理论。

Result: 结果表明，骨架操作具有类似标准操作的代数性质，图谱系可以逼近连续极限对象，并成功应用于深度神经网络和多网格方法。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法为层次化模型架构（hierarchitectures）提供了一种高效的代数框架，适用于多尺度分析和优化问题。

Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the
architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning
and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered
by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number
of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2)
bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in
multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using
prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures
between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded
graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard
algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product,
disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence
hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar
but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard
counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can
approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on
graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of
multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers
(useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal"
functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and
(hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to
defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local
sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such
application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces)
and to multigrid numerical methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于个性化内部认知的自动真实人格识别方法，通过短音频-视觉行为模拟认知，并利用2D-GNN进行人格推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常作为外部观察者推断人格印象，与真实人格存在偏差，导致识别性能不佳。

Method: 模拟个性化内部认知，构建包含二维节点和边特征的图，设计2D-GNN进行人格推断，采用端到端联合训练策略。

Result: 通过模拟真实人格相关认知，提高了人格识别的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模拟内部认知和2D-GNN，有效提升了真实人格识别的性能。

Abstract: Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to evaluate human real
personality traits from their expressive behaviours. However, most existing
solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality
impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which
significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to
inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real
personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of
expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently
simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short
audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated
personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce
the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions,
is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge
feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for
inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related
cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition
simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.

Conclusion: 语义条件集成是高效适应SAM架构的实用且可扩展方法。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization
in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts
remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and
boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for
adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic
guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called
Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling
semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture
frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer
block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through
supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data
subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as
input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation
on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic
conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for
efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

TL;DR: 在Few-Shot图像分类中，通过引入目标局部位置信息显著提升性能，Segment Anything Model和无需监督的前景提取方法也能实现大部分改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-Shot图像分类中，图像因多目标或复杂背景导致模糊性，影响性能。

Method: 利用目标在图像中的局部位置信息，结合Segment Anything Model或无监督前景提取方法。

Result: 显著提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 局部位置信息和简单标注或无监督方法可有效改善Few-Shot分类。

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as
one example per class, the presence of image ambiguities stemming from multiple
objects or complex backgrounds can significantly deteriorate performance. Our
research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local
positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification
across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant
fraction of the improvement can be achieved through the use of the Segment
Anything Model, requiring only a pixel of the object of interest to be pointed
out, or by employing fully unsupervised foreground object extraction methods.

Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在长距离依赖和全局上下文建模方面存在局限，而Transformer的计算复杂度和内存消耗较高，限制了其在高分辨率深度图处理中的应用。

Method: 设计了结合残差密集通道注意力块和Mamba状态空间模块的结构，利用多尺度跨模态融合策略，通过彩色图像的高频纹理信息指导深度图超分辨率。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上验证了模型的有效性，显著减少了参数量并提升了重建精度，尤其在大规模深度图超分辨率任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: MSF-UM模型通过结合局部特征提取和长距离依赖建模的优势，实现了高效的深度图超分辨率，具有优秀的泛化能力。

Abstract: Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution
of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail
information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in
dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global
contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global
dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are
quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution
depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba
(MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core
innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling
capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color
image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and
the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature
extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of
the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the
model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the
high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the
super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream
methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model
parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness
of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task
of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在初始化时间长和多视图一致性不足的问题，PointGauss旨在通过点云分割驱动流程直接解析高斯基元来解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 基于点云的高斯基元解码器，可在1分钟内生成3D实例掩码；2. GPU加速的2D掩码渲染系统，确保多视图一致性。

Conclusion: PointGauss通过高效的点云引导框架和GPU加速渲染，显著改进了3D分割性能，并提出了新的数据集DesktopObjects-360以解决现有基准的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce PointGauss, a novel point cloud-guided framework for real-time
multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. Unlike
existing methods that suffer from prolonged initialization and limited
multi-view consistency, our approach achieves efficient 3D segmentation by
directly parsing Gaussian primitives through a point cloud segmentation-driven
pipeline. The key innovation lies in two aspects: (1) a point cloud-based
Gaussian primitive decoder that generates 3D instance masks within 1 minute,
and (2) a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system that ensures multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over
previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance gains of 1.89 to
31.78% in multi-view mIoU, while maintaining superior computational efficiency.
To address the limitations of current benchmarks (single-object focus,
inconsistent 3D evaluation, small scale, and partial coverage), we present
DesktopObjects-360, a novel comprehensive dataset for 3D segmentation in
radiance fields, featuring: (1) complex multi-object scenes, (2) globally
consistent 2D annotations, (3) large-scale training data (over 27 thousand 2D
masks), (4) full 360{\deg} coverage, and (5) 3D evaluation masks.

Result: 在多样化视觉语言任务上，方法优于现有持续学习方案，生成更符合指令的响应。

Conclusion: 框架有效平衡视觉与语言信息，提升持续学习性能。

Abstract: Continual learning enables pre-trained generative vision-language models
(VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from
previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual
information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large
language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize
visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with
repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language
instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of
visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture
of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language
translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new
tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose
an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to
those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to
alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in
previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches
by generating instruction-following responses.

Abstract: Multimodal referring segmentation aims to segment target objects in visual
scenes, such as images, videos, and 3D scenes, based on referring expressions
in text or audio format. This task plays a crucial role in practical
applications requiring accurate object perception based on user instructions.
Over the past decade, it has gained significant attention in the multimodal
community, driven by advances in convolutional neural networks, transformers,
and large language models, all of which have substantially improved multimodal
perception capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of
multimodal referring segmentation. We begin by introducing this field's
background, including problem definitions and commonly used datasets. Next, we
summarize a unified meta architecture for referring segmentation and review
representative methods across three primary visual scenes, including images,
videos, and 3D scenes. We further discuss Generalized Referring Expression
(GREx) methods to address the challenges of real-world complexity, along with
related tasks and practical applications. Extensive performance comparisons on
standard benchmarks are also provided. We continually track related works at

Motivation: 语义对应是计算机视觉中的基础任务，但其在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性研究不足。

Method: 建立包含14种挑战性场景的基准数据集，评估现有方法和模型（如DINO和Stable Diffusion）的性能。

Result: 现有方法在恶劣条件下性能下降，大规模视觉模型提升鲁棒性，但微调会降低相对鲁棒性；DINO优于Stable Diffusion，融合两者效果更佳。

Conclusion: 任务特定的鲁棒性增强设计是必要的，通用数据增强效果有限。

Abstract: Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful
relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in
computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D
reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of
large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable
performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness
of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated.
In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic
correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14
distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging
issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and
environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key
insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All
existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse
conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness,
but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3)
The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and
their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common
robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that
general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for
task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and
real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is
recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However,
detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in
real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is
decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with
heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial
Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network to better extract key facial features and improve detection
performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity
Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different
operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the
global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool
that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and
cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,
flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that
our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning
settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling
real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in
intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and
reliable drowsiness detection.

Conclusion: TITAN-Guide不仅降低了内存需求，还在多个扩散指导基准测试中显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy
supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks.
Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a
favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However,
the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory
requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These
shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require
intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this
work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video
Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues,
and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the
counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing
diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model.
In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks
with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory
during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed
approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances
T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks. Code, models,
and demo are available at https://titanguide.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一理解不同动态对象的需求，以及生物研究中跨物种姿态和形状准确估计的重要性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，包括具有挑战性的 Animal Kingdom 数据集。

Conclusion: AniMer+ 的网络架构和合成数据集显著提升了实际应用性能。

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of
different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower
stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and
shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in
biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the
limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive
multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an
extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a
unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key
innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer
(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture
partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)
and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and
common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical
shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a
diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces
two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for
birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for
birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on
an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining
real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over
existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the
challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated
synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack
robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios
in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework
for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by
integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach
begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera
views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and
stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view
spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable
area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control
conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian
insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism,
spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish
the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view
pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data
augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 通过解耦增强流程和动态对齐策略，显著提升了低光图像增强性能。

Abstract: The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency,
provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based
cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution,
capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based
methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully
exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance.
Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement
pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure
refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with
amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude
and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy
with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by
the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to
refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility
restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to
simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact
degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model
to learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety
applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity,
unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it
difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and
generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we
propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection
(GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to
produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos.
These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In
addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the
influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The
experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提升文本对齐和目标分布保真度，且无需额外计算开销。

Conclusion: 提出的个性化引导方法有效平衡了微调模型的性能，适用于多种微调策略。

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the
pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image
generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent
trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject
fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text
editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output
toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target
distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method
leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover,
our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model
through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during
inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance
scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space
without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution
fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

reference targets with known spectral reflectances, our method only requires an
uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet, readily available off-the-shelf. By
capturing images of the direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through
the grating sheet, our method estimates both the camera spectral sensitivity
and the diffraction grating parameters in a closed-form manner. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method outperforms
conventional reference target-based methods, underscoring its effectiveness and
practicality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双代理的多图像推理框架，通过语言提示和视觉推理模型实现跨任务和多数据集的自动化推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态任务中跨数据集和任务格式的推理挑战。

Method: 使用PromptEngineer生成任务提示，VisionReasoner进行推理，无需训练且模块化。

Result: 在18个数据集上表现优异，Claude 3.7在TQA、DocVQA等任务中接近天花板性能。

Conclusion: LVLMs在信息提示引导下可有效进行多图像推理，设计选择对性能有显著影响。

Abstract: We present a Collaborative Agent-Based Framework for Multi-Image Reasoning.
Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across
diverse datasets and task formats by employing a dual-agent system: a
language-based PromptEngineer, which generates context-aware, task-specific
prompts, and a VisionReasoner, a large vision-language model (LVLM) responsible
for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and
training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question
answering, and free-form generation tasks involving one or multiple input
images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE
Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks
including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and
scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively
reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude
3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13%
accuracy), DocVQA (96.87%), and MMCoQA (75.28 ROUGE-L). We also explore how
design choices-such as model selection, shot count, and input length-influence
the reasoning performance of different LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于速度引导的可学习卡尔曼滤波器（SG-LKF），通过动态调整不确定性建模以适应车辆速度，显著提升了动态场景中的多目标跟踪稳定性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多目标跟踪方法依赖静态坐标变换，忽略了车辆速度对观测噪声和参考帧变化的影响，导致在高动态场景中跟踪性能下降。

Method: 提出SG-LKF，结合MotionScaleNet（MSNet）动态预测关键参数，并引入自监督轨迹一致性损失以增强帧间关联和轨迹连续性。

Result: 在KITTI 2D MOT上以79.59% HOTA排名第一，KITTI 3D MOT上达82.03% HOTA，nuScenes 3D MOT上比SimpleTrack高出2.2% AMOTA。

Conclusion: SG-LKF通过动态适应车辆速度，显著提升了多目标跟踪在高动态场景中的性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously
perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction,
behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional
tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate
transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle
speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes,
which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed
scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed
in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that
dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly
improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF
is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that
adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame
association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised
trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional
constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all
vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results
on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on
nuScenes 3D MOT.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的协作感知方法CoST，通过统一时空空间同时聚合多智能体和多时间观测，提升了传输效率和感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法将多智能体融合和多时间融合分离的问题，提升协作感知的效率和准确性。

Method: 提出协作感知时空变换器（CoST），统一时空空间进行特征传输和融合。

Result: CoST在效率和准确性上均有提升，且兼容多数现有方法。

Conclusion: CoST通过统一时空空间优化了协作感知的性能和效率。

Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps
solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small
sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and
multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes
an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from
different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal
space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,
i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient
feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the
spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas
prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior
feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified
spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby
enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our
Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains
improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any
specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods,
enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

Conclusion: 该方法在蜂蜜植物来源分类中表现优异，达到了当前最佳水平。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method for automatically
classifying honey botanical origins. Dataset preparation, feature extraction,
and classification are the three main steps of the proposed method. We use a
class transformation method in the dataset preparation phase to maximize the
separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and
reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the
extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate
our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset.
Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces
state-of-the-art results on this dataset, achieving the highest classification
accuracy of 95.13% for hyperspectral image-based classification and 92.80% for
hyperspectral instance-based classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图3D重建的现有方法在泛化性和重建质量上存在不足，SparseRecon旨在通过新方法提升重建效果。

Method: 结合体积渲染的特征一致性损失和不确定性引导的深度约束，优化神经隐式场，解决视图一致性不足和遮挡问题。

Result: 实验表明，SparseRecon在稀疏视图输入下优于现有方法，尤其在小重叠视图场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: SparseRecon通过新设计的约束机制，显著提升了稀疏视图3D重建的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or
scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based
or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not
generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the
reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the
limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel
neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume
rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.
Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the
neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by
insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and
smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an
uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in
areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry
details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce
high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with
small overlapping views. Project page: https://hanl2010.github.io/SparseRecon/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度的增加，Transformer模型的计算成本（尤其是自注意力的二次成本）和GPU内存访问开销显著增加，现有方法如token压缩和FlashAttention存在兼容性问题。

Method: 提出Representation Shift度量方法，通过测量token表示的变化程度实现token压缩，无需注意力图或重新训练，且适用于多种模型（如Transformer、CNN和状态空间模型）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频-文本检索和视频QA任务中分别实现了5.5%和4.4%的速度提升。

Conclusion: Representation Shift是一种高效且通用的token压缩方法，解决了现有技术与FlashAttention的兼容性问题，并在多种任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language,
and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more
tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU
memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has
proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative
tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been
developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction
and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most
training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to
determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a
training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each
token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with
FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further
generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive
experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression
compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and
4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统方法因单向性限制性能，难以捕捉场景中的语义子动作，BiAnt旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合前向和后向预测，利用大语言模型进行双向预测。

Result: 在Ego4D数据集上，BiAnt在编辑距离指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: BiAnt通过双向预测有效提升长期动作预测性能。

Abstract: Video-based long-term action anticipation is crucial for early risk detection
in areas such as automated driving and robotics. Conventional approaches
extract features from past actions using encoders and predict future events
with decoders, which limits performance due to their unidirectional nature.
These methods struggle to capture semantically distinct sub-actions within a
scene. The proposed method, BiAnt, addresses this limitation by combining
forward prediction with backward prediction using a large language model.
Experimental results on Ego4D demonstrate that BiAnt improves performance in
terms of edit distance compared to baseline methods.

Result: 优化了缺陷检测性能，并通过专家验证提升了系统的可靠性和透明度。

Conclusion: Adapt-WeldNet和DDIA框架提升了焊接缺陷检测的信任度、安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of
piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine
and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods
often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures
and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for
defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained
architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for
deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that
systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning
strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and
hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights.
Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA)
framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable
AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific
evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals.
Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the
principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and
accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in
automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance
and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in
welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore
and marine environments.

Motivation: 空间转录组学成本高且技术复杂，限制了临床应用。从常规病理图像预测基因表达是一种实用替代方案，但现有ViT模型性能不足。

Method: 提出$MV_{Hybrid}$架构，结合SSMs和ViT，利用SSMs的低频偏置特性捕捉形态学模式。在相同数据集上预训练并与其他架构对比。

Result: $MV_{Hybrid}$在基因表达预测中相关性比ViT高57%，性能下降减少43%，且在分类、检索和生存预测任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: $MV_{Hybrid}$是一种有前景的下一代病理视觉基础模型架构，代码已开源。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue
context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response
prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption.
Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology
images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models
(VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below
clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse
whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs
may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating
with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized
with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce
$MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models
(SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for
pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using
the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models
using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same
biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher
correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance
degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction,
demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore,
$MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification,
patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing
its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

Conclusion: Cued-Agent通过多智能体协作有效解决了CS识别中的异步问题，为有限数据下的多模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading
with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing
impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures
and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal
asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex
modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by
limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity
for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in
handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose
the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It
integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based
Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt
strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip
Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand
Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip
features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction
Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from
phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through
semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS
dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a
mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios
compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at

Conclusion: DAPT通过对称模态对齐和注意力优化，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm,
has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific
transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously
overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly
conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.
Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the
biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To
address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive
decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the
visual modality into the foreground and background representation via
exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these
decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the
hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal
alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual
pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,
directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the
region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT
through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient
learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks.
Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增加自编码器的潜在通道数可提高重建质量，但会导致扩散模型收敛慢，限制了潜在扩散模型的质量上限。

Method: 提出了结构化潜在空间和增强扩散训练两种创新方法，前者通过训练在潜在空间中引入通道结构，后者通过额外扩散训练目标加速收敛。

Result: DC-AE 1.5在ImageNet 512x512上比DC-AE生成质量更好，且速度快4倍。

Conclusion: DC-AE 1.5通过创新方法解决了潜在通道增加带来的问题，显著提升了扩散模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for
high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel
number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality.
However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer
generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the
quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of
autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key
innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a
training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the
latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter
latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an
augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training
objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these
techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling
results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better
image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code:

Result: 在文本到视频和图像到视频任务中，该方法表现出强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过结合RGB和光流特征，该方法能有效检测多种伪造视频。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to
increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video
forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained
temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual
fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework
that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance
features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch
architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level
artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion
anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these
complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of
forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks
across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong
generalization ability of the proposed approach.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在HOI场景中显著优于现有方法，且无需真实接触标注仍具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了机器对动态环境的感知能力，适用于3D重建和新视角/姿态合成等任务。

Abstract: Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of
objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex
human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing
methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to
generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited
understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach
that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional
inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints
from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions:
the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the
secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional
inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions
within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the
generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in
HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like
understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust
even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability
to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

Result: 在零样本条件下，八种先进视频语言模型在iSafetyBench上表现不佳，尤其在危险活动识别和多标签场景中。

Conclusion: iSafetyBench揭示了现有模型的性能差距，强调了开发更鲁棒、安全感知的多模态模型的必要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot
settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where
recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is
essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous
scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world
industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags
spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired
with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label
evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and
safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language
models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing
video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in
recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results
reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust,
safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench
provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction. The
dataset is available at: https://github.com/raiyaan-abdullah/iSafety-Bench.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AerialCSP的虚拟数据集，用于模拟CSP（聚光太阳能发电）工厂的航拍图像，以减少对大量人工标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CSP工厂的航拍图像具有高反射表面和领域特定元素，传统计算机视觉模型难以泛化，而收集和标注真实数据成本高昂。

Method: 通过生成高质量的合成数据集AerialCSP，模拟真实条件，用于预训练模型，并评估其在CSP相关视觉任务中的表现。

Result: 预训练在AerialCSP上的模型显著提高了真实世界故障检测的准确性，尤其是对小而罕见的缺陷。

Conclusion: AerialCSP为CSP工厂的航拍图像分析提供了有效的预训练解决方案，减少了人工标注的需求。

Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images
captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural
landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly
reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in
traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models
trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without
extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting
and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for
rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of
AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By
generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our
objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment,
significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main
contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality
synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data
for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models
on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we
demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world
fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for
extensive manual labeling. AerialCSP is made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出TopoTTA框架，通过两阶段方法解决TSS中的域偏移问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TSS对域偏移敏感，传统方法难以保持拓扑完整性，需针对性地解决。

Method: TopoTTA分两阶段：1) 使用TopoMDCs适应拓扑差异；2) 通过TopoHG生成伪标签优化拓扑连续性。

Result: 在四个场景和十个数据集上平均提升31.81%的clDice指标。

Conclusion: TopoTTA是首个针对TSS的TTA框架，可作为即插即用解决方案。

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications,
such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress
in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance
degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is
more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can
compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features
distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may
further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose
Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time
adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two
stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using
the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance
topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2
improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation
(TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels
in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four
scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling
topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in
clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS
models.

*Tao Wu,Jingyuan Ye,Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态效率指数（DEI）和多阶段视频恢复框架（PMR），用于解决大气湍流导致的视频质量下降问题，特别是在高湍流和复杂动态场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流引起的几何畸变和模糊问题严重影响了远距离动态场景视频的质量，现有方法难以恢复边缘细节和消除混合失真。

Method: 引入动态效率指数（DEI）量化视频动态强度，并提出物理模型驱动的多阶段视频恢复框架（PMR），包括去倾斜、运动分割增强和去模糊三个阶段。

Result: 实验表明，PMR能有效抑制运动拖影、恢复边缘细节，并在高湍流和复杂动态场景中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为高湍流和复杂动态场景下的视频恢复提供了高效解决方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Geometric distortions and blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence degrade
the quality of long-range dynamic scene videos. Existing methods struggle with
restoring edge details and eliminating mixed distortions, especially under
conditions of strong turbulence and complex dynamics. To address these
challenges, we introduce a Dynamic Efficiency Index ($DEI$), which combines
turbulence intensity, optical flow, and proportions of dynamic regions to
accurately quantify video dynamic intensity under varying turbulence conditions
and provide a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. Additionally, we
propose a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration ($PMR$) framework
that consists of three stages: \textbf{de-tilting} for geometric stabilization,
\textbf{motion segmentation enhancement} for dynamic region refinement, and
\textbf{de-blurring} for quality restoration. $PMR$ employs lightweight
backbones and stage-wise joint training to ensure both efficiency and high
restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details and
exhibits strong generalization capability, especially in real-world scenarios
characterized by high-turbulence and complex dynamics. We will make the code
and datasets openly available.

TL;DR: LesiOnTime是一种新型3D分割方法，结合纵向影像和BI-RADS评分，显著提升小病灶分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要针对大病灶，忽视了纵向和临床信息，而早期癌症检测需要这些信息。

Method: 提出Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)块和BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR)损失，整合纵向数据和临床评分。

Result: 在DCE-MRI数据集上，Dice分数比现有方法高5%，TPA和BCR均贡献性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合时间和临床背景对乳腺癌筛查中的早期病灶分割至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced
MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk
patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,
they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and
clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,
detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across
timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS
score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics
clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and
BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)
block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans;
and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent
space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding
domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house
longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5%
in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute
complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of
incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion
segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening. Our code is publicly

TL;DR: Sortblock是一种无需训练的推理加速框架，通过动态缓存块级特征并选择性跳过冗余计算，显著提升DiTs的推理速度，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs因其顺序去噪过程导致高推理延迟，限制了实时应用。现有加速方法未能充分利用去噪阶段和Transformer块的语义变化。

Method: 提出Sortblock框架，动态缓存块级特征，基于相邻时间步的相似性排序，自适应确定重计算比例，并引入轻量级线性预测机制减少误差。

Result: 实验表明，Sortblock在多种任务和DiT架构中实现超过2倍的推理加速，且输出质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: Sortblock为扩散生成模型提供了一种高效且通用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that
enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential
denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment
in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches
typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking
the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To
address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration
framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity
across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock
adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant
computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a
lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped
blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures
demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with
minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable
solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Wukong是一个基于Transformer的NSFW检测框架，利用扩散模型早期去噪步骤的中间输出，显著优于基于文本的防护措施，并与图像过滤器精度相当，但效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NSFW检测方法（文本过滤器和图像过滤器）存在局限性，如忽略模型特定变化或计算成本高，需要一种更高效且准确的外部防护方法。

Method: Wukong利用扩散模型早期去噪步骤的中间输出和预训练的U-Net交叉注意力参数，实现在扩散过程中的早期检测。

Result: Wukong在NSFW检测上显著优于文本过滤器，与图像过滤器精度相当，同时效率更高。

Conclusion: Wukong提供了一种高效且准确的NSFW检测方法，适用于现代T2I系统。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC)
technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs
may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating
community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known
as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into
two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I
model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image
filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly
and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems
like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a
U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1)
early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)
cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image
regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW
detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising
steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong
operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting
for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts,
seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two
public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms
text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while
offering much greater efficiency.

Result: 方法在定量和定性上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过改进判别器和损失函数，实现了视觉吸引且全局一致的视频外绘效果。

Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while
maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the
use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and
reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as
in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting
models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry
results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a
critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a
discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the
extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of
adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical
discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a
specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global
features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function
enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and
globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary
materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

Result: D3在4个开源数据集上表现优异，例如在Gen-Video上比之前最佳方法提升10.39%的平均精度。

Conclusion: D3具有高效的计算性能和鲁棒性，为合成视频检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it
increasingly easy to produce high-fidelity AI-generated videos, raising public
concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, existing
detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of
temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a
theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian
mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features
tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical
foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature
distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose
Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection
method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We
validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video,
VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo,
D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average
Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations
demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba的水下实例分割模型UIS-Mamba，通过动态树扫描（DTS）和隐藏状态弱化（HSW）模块解决水下场景的特殊挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下实例分割任务因水下场景的特殊性（如颜色失真和边界模糊）面临挑战，现有方法难以保持实例内部连续性。

Method: 设计了DTS模块（动态调整补丁偏移和缩放）和HSW模块（基于Ncut的隐藏状态弱化机制），以优化Mamba模型在水下任务中的应用。

Result: 在UIIS和USIS10K数据集上实现了最先进性能，同时保持低参数和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: UIS-Mamba通过创新模块有效解决了水下实例分割的挑战，为相关任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater
complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with
inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable
for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,
due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in
applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot
maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of
severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the
hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the
understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first
Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two
innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to
migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of
the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to
dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and
providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the
interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information
flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based
hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while
maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity. Code is

Conclusion: 研究强调了在虚拟化身通信中行为生物特征防御的重要性，并提供了公开数据集和系统。

Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in
virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more
immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One
emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's
avatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to
detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore
the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our
main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as
reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's
visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we
introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a
state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and
impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable
spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal
attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial
gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable
meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed
benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in
order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral
biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.

Result: 在低剂量CT去噪和T1到T2 MRI翻译任务中表现优于基线模型和现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: 动态样本特定调整是提升模型在真实场景中鲁棒性的有效途径。

Abstract: Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical
imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion.
However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples
without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the
translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our
method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a
Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a
pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the
performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We
evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose
CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over
both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our
analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly
apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples,
demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path
to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有交互式抠图方法在边缘细节提取上表现不足，而扩散模型在复杂数据建模和纹理合成上表现优异，适合用于抠图任务。

Conclusion: SDMatte通过扩散模型和视觉提示驱动，显著提升了交互式抠图的效果，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Recent interactive matting methods have shown satisfactory performance in
capturing the primary regions of objects, but they fall short in extracting
fine-grained details in edge regions. Diffusion models trained on billions of
image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex
data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting
robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution
for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven
interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the
powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction
capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable
interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual
prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing
SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information.
Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to
focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting. Our code

TL;DR: AutoDebias是一个自动识别和减轻文本到图像（T2I）模型中社会偏见的框架，无需预先了解具体偏见类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型常表现出未提及的社会偏见（如性别或种族刻板印象），现有方法难以处理复杂或重叠的偏见。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型检测偏见模式，生成包容性提示，并通过CLIP引导的训练过程优化模型。

Result: 在25种偏见场景中，AutoDebias准确检测91.6%的偏见，将偏见输出从90%降至可忽略水平，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: AutoDebias能有效处理复杂和多重偏见，且不影响模型性能。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images from text prompts but
often exhibit unintended social biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes,
even when these attributes are not mentioned. Existing debiasing methods work
well for simple or well-known cases but struggle with subtle or overlapping
biases. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and
mitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias
types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect
biased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive
alternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a
CLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the
original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods,
AutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple
interacting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25
bias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur
simultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and
reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the
visual fidelity of the original model.

TL;DR: CLIPTime是一个基于CLIP架构的多模态多任务框架，用于预测真菌生长的发育阶段和时间戳，无需显式时间输入即可进行时间感知推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解生物生长的时间动态在微生物学、农业和生物降解研究中至关重要，但现有视觉语言模型在捕捉时间进展方面表现有限。

Method: CLIPTime通过联合学习视觉-文本嵌入，结合分类和回归任务，预测离散生长阶段和连续时间戳。

Result: 实验表明，CLIPTime能有效建模生物进展，并生成可解释的时间相关输出。

Conclusion: CLIPTime展示了视觉语言模型在现实生物监测应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across
diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research.
Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining
(CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their
effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address
this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to
predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal
growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model
learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without
requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and
evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with
aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs
classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside
continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including
temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware
predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models
biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs,
highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological
monitoring applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIF-Net提出了一种融合多光谱和高光谱图像的框架，通过引入不适定先验和可逆Mamba架构，解决了数据不对齐问题，显著提升了图像恢复性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像融合（MHIF）任务因光谱与空间信息的固有权衡和观测数据有限而具有不适定性，现有方法未能有效解决数据不对齐问题。

Method: 提出PIF-Net框架，结合不适定先验和可逆Mamba架构，设计Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation模块动态校准特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PIF-Net显著优于现有方法，同时保持模型高效性。

Conclusion: PIF-Net通过创新架构和模块设计，有效解决了MHIF任务的不适定问题，实现了高性能的图像融合。

Abstract: The goal of multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF) is to
generate high-quality images that simultaneously possess rich spectral
information and fine spatial details. However, due to the inherent trade-off
between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of
observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not
effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which
explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral
images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with
computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba
architecture that maintains information consistency during feature
transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process
reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the
Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral
and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly
better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining model efficiency.

Result: 实验表明SeTe-VSR在细节恢复和感知质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SeTe-VSR在复杂视频超分辨率任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated
impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to
limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high
fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal
consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we
propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel
approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the
latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level
semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our
approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and
ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual
content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail
recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex
video super-resolution tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HyPCV-Former的双曲时空变换器，用于3D点云视频中的异常检测，通过双曲空间建模事件层次结构和时空连续性，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在RGB或深度域中使用欧几里得表示，难以捕捉事件的层次结构和时空连续性，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这些限制。

Method: 首先从点云序列中提取每帧空间特征，并将其嵌入洛伦兹双曲空间；引入双曲多头自注意力机制（HMHA）建模时间动态，直接在双曲空间中进行特征变换和异常评分。

Result: 在TIMo数据集上性能提升7%，在DAD数据集上提升5.6%，优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: HyPCV-Former通过双曲空间建模显著提升了异常检测性能，为视频监控领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with
broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems.
Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth
domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event
structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we
propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for
anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts
per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud
extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better
captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal
dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism
that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn
temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all
feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian
space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a
5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: LAMIC是一个无需训练的布局感知多图像合成框架，通过两种注意力机制实现多参考图像的布局感知生成，并在多个指标上达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多参考图像合成中布局一致性和背景一致性的挑战。

Method: 基于MMDiT模型，引入Group Isolation Attention和Region-Modulated Attention两种注意力机制。

Result: 在ID-S、BG-S、IN-R和AVG等指标上优于现有方法，展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LAMIC为可控多图像合成提供了一种无需训练的新范式，具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: In controllable image synthesis, generating coherent and consistent images
from multiple references with spatial layout awareness remains an open
challenge. We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework
that, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to
multi-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT
model, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group
Isolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)
Region-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To
comprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three
metrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout
control; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background
consistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art
performance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing
multi-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all
settings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results
demonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background
preservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any
training or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By
inheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling
seamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new
training-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation
models continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale
accordingly. Our implementation is available at:

Result: 方法减少了标注异常，支持细粒度标注，并在编码空间中形成旋转不变的语义关系。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督流程在遥感影像标注中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate
labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time
and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on
pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work,
we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas
of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our
approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with
convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space
for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into
homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial
similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the
surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local
neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces
outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and
allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be
formed within the encoding space.

Motivation: 自我中心视频在增强现实和机器人等领域日益重要，但现有研究主要集中于外中心视频，自我中心视频的时空定位研究不足。

Method: 通过系统分析自我中心与外中心视频的差异，提出EgoMask基准和自动标注管道，并构建EgoMask-Train训练数据集。

Result: 实验表明，现有先进模型在EgoMask上表现不佳，但通过EgoMask-Train微调后性能显著提升，同时不影响外中心数据集的表现。

Conclusion: EgoMask为自我中心视频理解提供了关键资源和见解，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos
based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress
in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored,
despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and
robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies
between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as
shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and
larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask,
the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in
egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation
pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-,
medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a
large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments
demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform
poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields
significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets.
Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing
egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at

Motivation: 水下鱼类检测（UFD）因低分辨率、背景干扰和目标与环境的视觉相似性而具有挑战性。现有方法通常以增加模型复杂性和降低效率为代价。

Method: EPANet包含两个关键组件：高效路径聚合特征金字塔网络（EPA-FPN）和多尺度多样化短路径瓶颈（MS-DDSP瓶颈）。EPA-FPN通过跨尺度长程跳跃连接增强语义-空间互补性，MS-DDSP瓶颈通过细粒度特征分割和多样化卷积操作提升局部特征多样性。

Conclusion: EPANet通过高效的特征集成和轻量级设计，显著提升了水下鱼类检测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) remains a challenging task in computer vision
due to low object resolution, significant background interference, and high
visual similarity between targets and surroundings. Existing approaches
primarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention
mechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model
complexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an
efficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary
feature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of
two key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network
(EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP
bottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across
disparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer
fusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP
bottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing
finer-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby
increasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive
experiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed,
while maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.

Motivation: 视频色彩分级通常需要专业技能，限制了非专业人士的使用。本文旨在简化这一过程，使其更易于操作。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成LUT，对齐参考场景与输入视频的高层特征（如风格、情绪），并通过文本提示调整低层特征（如对比度、亮度）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效进行视频色彩分级，且不损失结构细节，推理速度快。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为视频色彩分级提供了一种高效且用户友好的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves
adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is
used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of
the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading
remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we
present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is
explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment
between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training
objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like
look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our
LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural
details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We
further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for
low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc.
Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for video color grading. Codes are publicly
available at https://github.com/seunghyuns98/VideoColorGrading.

Motivation: 临床决策依赖于解剖结构和异常的相对位置理解，但目前VLMs在此任务上的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 评估了GPT-4o、Llama3.2等先进VLMs的表现，并尝试通过视觉提示（如标记）提升性能。

Result: 所有模型均表现不佳，视觉提示仅带来有限改进，且医学图像表现显著低于自然图像。

Conclusion: VLMs在医学图像中更依赖先验知识而非图像内容，需进一步研究；为此提出了MIRP基准数据集。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions
of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately
determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite.
Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To
address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o,
Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this
fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we
investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers
placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers
provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical
images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest
that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on
actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading
to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we
introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset,
designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative
positions in medical images.

Conclusion: DBLP为实时对抗净化迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success
across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial
perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based
adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising,
severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose
Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient
diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach
is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled
alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data
distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance
semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses
multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification
process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and
around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time
adversarial purification.

Conclusion: HiPrune是一种高效、通用的视觉令牌剪枝方法，显著提升推理效率且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual
tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference
efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue,
they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific
training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose
HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that
exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We
identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers
capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects
three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in
object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial
continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for
global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates
seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5,
LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art
pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3%
tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it
reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong
generalization across models and tasks. Code is available at

Result: 在八个基准测试中，FreeCP作为即插即用模块显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: FreeCP有效解决了开放词汇语义分割中的关键挑战，为无需训练方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful
approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However,
the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on
large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS.
Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model
architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance.
However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where
multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and
visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create
confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class
activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these
observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification
framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying
semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity.
The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final
segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP,
as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when
combined with other OVSS methods.

Motivation: 铰接物体是日常环境中重要的交互对象，但现有方法在物理合理性和点云对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 使用带符号距离函数（SDFs）表示部件形状，通过点云对齐损失和非穿透性、移动性约束指导反向扩散过程，并结合类别信息优化对齐。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility数据集上评估，PhysNAP在约束一致性和生成能力之间取得了平衡，优于无指导的扩散模型。

Conclusion: PhysNAP能够生成物理合理且与点云对齐的铰接物体，为相关领域提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Articulated objects are an important type of interactable objects in everyday
environments. In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based
approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point
clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part
shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion
process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs.
Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the
part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects.
We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point
cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the
generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP
using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided
baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint
consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标检测方法依赖大量标注边界框，标注成本高且需专家知识，限制了应用范围。

Method: 利用预训练模型预测图像中病毒存在与否，生成伪标签，结合优化方法和缩小感受野直接提取病毒颗粒。

Result: 伪标签方法在标注时间有限的情况下，性能优于现有弱标注方法甚至真实标注。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了标注成本，同时提升了检测性能，适用于标注资源有限的场景。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for object detection rely on annotated
bounding boxes of large data sets for training. However, obtaining such
annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual
labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be
provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object
detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are
significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a
pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus
in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a
state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization
approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly
without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we
show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more
importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and
even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is
limited.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合跨帧不确定性传播的视觉里程计方法CoProU-VO，显著提升了动态场景中的姿态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态物体破坏了静态场景假设，导致传统无监督视觉里程计方法在动态场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出CoProU-VO方法，通过概率建模结合目标帧和参考帧的不确定性，利用视觉Transformer同时学习深度、不确定性和相机姿态。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优于现有无监督单目方法，尤其在高速公路场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 跨帧不确定性传播能有效识别动态场景中的不可靠区域，提升视觉里程计的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is fundamental to autonomous navigation, robotics, and
augmented reality, with unsupervised approaches eliminating the need for
expensive ground-truth labels. However, these methods struggle when dynamic
objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose
estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a
commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects
and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional
uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the
uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty
must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify
unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge,
we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end
approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame
uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision
transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty
estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous
unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong
performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
cross-frame uncertainty propagation.

Motivation: 解决语义分割模型在真实驾驶场景中误分类未知物体的问题，尤其是在复杂场景中罕见类别与未知物体的混淆。

Method: 采用证据分类器结合似然比检验，生成概率分布以捕捉不确定性，而非点估计。

Result: 在五个标准数据集上，误报率降至2.5%，平均精度达90.91%，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 通过显式处理不确定性，方法有效提升了未知物体检测的性能，且计算高效。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown
objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown
objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes
are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these
limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood
ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a
semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty.
Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability
distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and
imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this
way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five
standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false
positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average
precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需在涉及弱势道路使用者（VRUs）的复杂行为场景中可靠运行，但现有数据集难以检索这些罕见行为。

Method: 结合SMPL运动序列和视频帧，编码到与自然语言对齐的多模态嵌入空间，支持通过文本查询检索人类行为及其上下文。

Result: 在WayMoCo数据集上，该方法在运动-上下文检索任务中比现有最优模型准确率提升27.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶系统提供了高效的人类行为场景检索工具，支持更全面的评估和泛化。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical
scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by
Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets
is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare
human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is
challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in
diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion
retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear
(SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding
them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language.
Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context
through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an
extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion
and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL
sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval,
when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的重建框架（EVAL），用于扩展VIIRS夜间灯光数据的时间序列，解决了现有方法低估光强度和结构遗漏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIIRS夜间灯光数据始于2012年，限制了长期时间序列研究，且当前扩展方法存在光强度低估和结构遗漏的缺陷。

Method: 采用两阶段重建框架：构建阶段使用分层融合解码器（HFD）提高初始重建的保真度；细化阶段利用双特征细化器（DFR）结合高分辨率不透水面掩模增强细节。

Result: 开发的EVAL产品将中国夜间灯光数据扩展至1986年，R²提升至0.80，RMSE降至0.99，优于现有产品。

Conclusion: EVAL数据集具有优异的时间一致性和社会经济参数相关性，为长期分析提供了可靠资源。

Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for
quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities.
Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its
temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series
studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending
VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant
shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural
omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction
framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The
construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to
enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage
employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution
impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details.
Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial
Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record
backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the
$\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99.
Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high
correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for
long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource
for the research community and is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.11888/HumanNat.tpdc.302930.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoMoE利用混合专家模型（MoE）分解运动场，通过概率先验引导分解和双路径校正器优化子场建模，显著提升两视图几何中的运动场估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂场景中运动场的异质性导致现有方法难以准确建模，GeoMoE旨在通过MoE分解和优化策略解决这一问题。

Method: 提出概率先验引导分解策略和MoE增强的双路径校正器，分别用于分解运动场和优化子场建模。

Result: 在相对位姿和单应性估计任务中优于现有方法，并表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeoMoE通过简洁设计有效建模异质运动场，为两视图几何问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing
smoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between
pairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by
extreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth
discontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous
motion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and
fail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion
fields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We
observe that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion
sub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion
patterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in
two-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first
devise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier
probability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion
field into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.
Next, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each
sub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a
customized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous
motion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational
entanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this
minimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in
relative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization. The
source code and pre-trained models are available at

Motivation: 构建多功能且鲁棒的全身人体姿态先验模型因姿态复杂性和高质量数据稀缺而具有挑战性。

Method: 提出扩散模型DPoser-X，采用截断时间步调度和掩码训练机制，结合全身和局部数据集。

Result: 在身体、手、脸和全身姿态建模的多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DPoser-X为全身人体姿态先验建模设定了新标准。

Abstract: We present DPoser-X, a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human
poses. Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior remains
challenging due to the inherent complexity of articulated human poses and the
scarcity of high-quality whole-body pose datasets. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Diffusion model as body Pose prior (DPoser) and
extend it to DPoser-X for expressive whole-body human pose modeling. Our
approach unifies various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems, solving them
through variational diffusion sampling. To enhance performance on downstream
applications, we introduce a novel truncated timestep scheduling method
specifically designed for pose data characteristics. We also propose a masked
training mechanism that effectively combines whole-body and part-specific
datasets, enabling our model to capture interdependencies between body parts
while avoiding overfitting to specific actions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DPoser-X's robustness and versatility across multiple benchmarks
for body, hand, face, and full-body pose modeling. Our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, establishing a new benchmark for
whole-body human pose prior modeling.

Conclusion: 合成数据能够有效克服数据集限制，增强可解释模型在医学图像分析中的实用性。

Abstract: Classification models that provide human-interpretable explanations enhance
clinicians' trust and usability in medical image diagnosis. One research focus
is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used
by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with
clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as
established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both
enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs.
However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale
medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this
challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative
model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it
using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset.
Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model
boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and
target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small
real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of
synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of
explainable models in medical image analysis.

Motivation: 现有防御评估缺乏统一框架，导致评估不一致和不完整，需建立全面基准以改进防御方法。

Method: 重新评估11种代表性防御方法，构建包含2种攻击目标、13种补丁攻击、11种目标检测器和4种指标的基准，并创建大规模对抗补丁数据集。

Result: 发现自然补丁防御的难点在于数据分布而非高频特征；新数据集可提升现有防御性能15.09% AP@0.5；自适应攻击能显著绕过现有防御。

Conclusion: 研究为补丁攻击/防御的评估和设计提供了指导，并提供了公开的代码和数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks on object detectors has
attracted increasing interest. However, we identify that existing defense
evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in
inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this
issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch
defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object
detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial
patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive
analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against
naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly
believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can
be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average
precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch
detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3)
Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with
complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust.
We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch
attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new
attacks/defenses.

Abstract: Image dehazing remains a challenging problem due to the spatially varying
nature of haze in real-world scenes. While existing methods have demonstrated
the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their
architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with
different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically
investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth
representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our
empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain
remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we
propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with
diverse dehazing architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks validate both the effectiveness and broad applicability of our
approach.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language
Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving
hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap,
we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs
and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating
object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three
core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object
Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting
semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and
cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key
factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations,
including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and
the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between
single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image
contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional
placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of
object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image
attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention
proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that
our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic
integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.

hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between
open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable

Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly
accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in
real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of
the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature
exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design
is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection
still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight
backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight
architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object
detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our
backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a
significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first
dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from
point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29%
reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2%
drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense
Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into
existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

Motivation: 现有自监督视觉基础模型能捕捉语义对应但缺乏对3D几何的感知，GECO旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 在PFPascal、APK和CUB数据集上PCK分别提升6.0%、6.2%和4.1%，运行速度达30 fps，比现有方法快98.2%。

Conclusion: GECO不仅提升了性能，还揭示了PCK指标的局限性，并提出了新的几何感知特征学习指标。

Abstract: Recent advances in feature learning have shown that self-supervised vision
foundation models can capture semantic correspondences but often lack awareness
of underlying 3D geometry. GECO addresses this gap by producing geometrically
coherent features that semantically distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g.,
left/right eyes, front/back legs). We propose a training framework based on
optimal transport, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions
and disocclusions. With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2%
faster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on
PFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively.
Finally, we show that PCK alone is insufficient to capture geometric quality
and introduce new metrics and insights for more geometry-aware feature
learning. Link to project page:

### [90] [SU-ESRGAN: Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN for Super-Resolution of Satellite and Drone Imagery with Fine-Tuning for Cross Domain Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00750)
*Prerana Ramkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SU-ESRGAN结合ESRGAN、DeepLabv3分割损失和蒙特卡洛dropout，为卫星图像提供语义一致性和像素级不确定性，适用于无人机和卫星系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs在超分辨率（SR）中缺乏语义一致性和像素级置信度，限制了其在遥感关键应用中的可信度。

Method: 提出SU-ESRGAN框架，集成ESRGAN、DeepLabv3分割损失和蒙特卡洛dropout，生成像素级不确定性图。

Result: SU-ESRGAN在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上与基线ESRGAN相当，适用于无人机和卫星系统。

Conclusion: SU-ESRGAN在跨域应用中表现良好，强调领域感知训练的重要性。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic
super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and
per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing
applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This
paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first
SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN,
segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo
dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results
(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This
novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide
field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The
modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or
post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression
and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its
performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone
based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance
evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial
Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training
data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

*Zihan Wang,Samira Ebrahimi Kahou,Narges Armanfard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PILOT框架通过双分支提示学习和无标签测试时适应策略，提升了零样本异常检测在领域偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本异常检测方法在领域偏移下表现不佳，因训练数据有限且难以泛化到新分布。

Method: PILOT采用双分支提示学习机制和基于高置信度伪标签的无标签测试时适应策略。

Result: 在13个工业和医学基准测试中，PILOT在领域偏移下的异常检测和定位性能达到最优。

Conclusion: PILOT通过动态提示学习和测试时适应，显著提升了零样本异常检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects
in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than
requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods,
whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because
their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to
generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework
designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel
dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of
learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to
adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2)
a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt
parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.
Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that
PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and
localization under domain shift.

*Alexander Nikitas Dimopoulos,Joseph Grasso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究分析了异构标记点云数据集的语义分割性能，重点关注公共安全应用中的挑战，如数据标注不统一和小物体检测困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决公共安全应用中点云数据语义分割的挑战，特别是异构标注数据集和小型安全相关特征的检测问题。

Method: 采用KPConv架构和分级标注方案，通过IoU指标评估性能，分析NIST的Point Cloud City数据集（Enfield和Memphis）。

Result: 结果显示几何大物体（如楼梯、窗户）分割性能较高，而小型安全关键特征识别率较低，受限于类别不平衡和几何区分度不足。

Conclusion: 研究指出公共安全领域的可靠点云语义分割需要标准化标注协议和改进标注技术，以应对数据异构性和小物体检测问题。

Abstract: This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously
labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including
pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point
Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges
in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded
schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics
on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability:
geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation
performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller
safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is
impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller
objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain
safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified
challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class
labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions
include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude
that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates
standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address
data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

### [93] [IGL-Nav: Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization for Image-goal Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00823)
*Wenxuan Guo,Xiuwei Xu,Hang Yin,Ziwei Wang,Jianjiang Feng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGL-Nav提出了一种基于增量3D高斯定位的高效图像目标导航框架，通过逐步更新场景表示和几何信息匹配，显著提升了导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以充分建模3D环境与目标图像之间的几何关系，且计算效率低下，因此需要一种更高效、3D感知的导航方法。

Method: 采用增量式3D高斯表示更新场景，结合粗粒度几何匹配和细粒度优化，实现高效目标定位。

Result: IGL-Nav在多种实验配置下显著优于现有方法，并能处理自由视角图像目标导航任务。

Conclusion: IGL-Nav为图像目标导航提供了一种高效、3D感知的解决方案，适用于实际机器人平台。

Abstract: Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging
problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or
modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot
fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and
the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image
in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian
(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS
optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly
leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is
prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D
Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal
navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as
new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely
localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space
matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent
is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization
via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental
configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal
setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to
capture goal image at arbitrary pose. Project page:

### [94] [Rethinking Evidence Hierarchies in Medical Language Benchmarks: A Critical Evaluation of HealthBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00081)
*Fred Mutisya,Shikoh Gitau,Nasubo Ongoma,Keith Mbae,Elizabeth Wamicha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthBench是一个用于评估AI在健康领域能力的基准，但依赖专家意见而非临床证据，存在偏见问题。本文提出基于临床实践指南（CPGs）的改进方法，以提升全球适用性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HealthBench的局限性在于其依赖专家意见，可能导致区域偏见和临床个体差异，尤其在低收入和中等收入地区问题更突出。

Method: 提出基于版本控制的CPGs的奖励函数，结合系统评价和GRADE证据评级，通过强化学习改进评估方法。

Result: 改进后的方法旨在提升医学语言模型的临床可信度、伦理性和全球适用性。

Conclusion: 通过重新定义奖励机制，结合透明度和医生参与，目标是开发更可靠、公平的医学语言模型。

Abstract: HealthBench, a benchmark designed to measure the capabilities of AI systems
for health better (Arora et al., 2025), has advanced medical language model
evaluation through physician-crafted dialogues and transparent rubrics.
However, its reliance on expert opinion, rather than high-tier clinical
evidence, risks codifying regional biases and individual clinician
idiosyncrasies, further compounded by potential biases in automated grading
systems. These limitations are particularly magnified in low- and middle-income
settings, where issues like sparse neglected tropical disease coverage and
region-specific guideline mismatches are prevalent.
  The unique challenges of the African context, including data scarcity,
inadequate infrastructure, and nascent regulatory frameworks, underscore the
urgent need for more globally relevant and equitable benchmarks. To address
these shortcomings, we propose anchoring reward functions in version-controlled
Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) that incorporate systematic reviews and
GRADE evidence ratings.
  Our roadmap outlines "evidence-robust" reinforcement learning via
rubric-to-guideline linkage, evidence-weighted scoring, and contextual override
logic, complemented by a focus on ethical considerations and the integration of
delayed outcome feedback. By re-grounding rewards in rigorously vetted CPGs,
while preserving HealthBench's transparency and physician engagement, we aim to
foster medical language models that are not only linguistically polished but
also clinically trustworthy, ethically sound, and globally relevant.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于HyperTWTL的安全强化学习方法（SecRL），用于满足机器人应用中的安全性和不透明性约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在探索基于超属性的安全强化学习方面存在空白，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种结合动态Boltzmann softmax RL和HyperTWTL约束的方法，用于学习安全最优策略。

Result: 通过案例研究验证了方法的有效性和可扩展性，并优于两种基线RL算法。

Conclusion: 该方法为安全强化学习提供了一种新思路，适用于机器人任务。

Abstract: Hyperproperties for Time Window Temporal Logic (HyperTWTL) is a
domain-specific formal specification language known for its effectiveness in
compactly representing security, opacity, and concurrency properties for
robotics applications. This paper focuses on HyperTWTL-constrained secure
reinforcement learning (SecRL). Although temporal logic-constrained safe
reinforcement learning (SRL) is an evolving research problem with several
existing literature, there is a significant research gap in exploring
security-aware reinforcement learning (RL) using hyperproperties. Given the
dynamics of an agent as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and opacity/security
constraints formalized as HyperTWTL, we propose an approach for learning
security-aware optimal policies using dynamic Boltzmann softmax RL while
satisfying the HyperTWTL constraints. The effectiveness and scalability of our
proposed approach are demonstrated using a pick-up and delivery robotic mission
case study. We also compare our results with two other baseline RL algorithms,
showing that our proposed method outperforms them.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织在工业环境中成功应用AI面临困难，尤其是端到端操作流程的改进。

Result: OCPM能够处理动态过程数据，形成过程智能（PI），为AI在组织中的应用提供支持。

Conclusion: AI需要过程智能（PI）来优化操作流程，OCPM与多种AI形式的结合具有广阔前景。

Abstract: The uptake of Artificial Intelligence (AI) impacts the way we work, interact,
do business, and conduct research. However, organizations struggle to apply AI
successfully in industrial settings where the focus is on end-to-end
operational processes. Here, we consider generative, predictive, and
prescriptive AI and elaborate on the challenges of diagnosing and improving
such processes. We show that AI needs to be grounded using Object-Centric
Process Mining (OCPM). Process-related data are structured and
organization-specific and, unlike text, processes are often highly dynamic.
OCPM is the missing link connecting data and processes and enables different
forms of AI. We use the term Process Intelligence (PI) to refer to the
amalgamation of process-centric data-driven techniques able to deal with a
variety of object and event types, enabling AI in an organizational context.
This paper explains why AI requires PI to improve operational processes and
highlights opportunities for successfully combining OCPM and generative,
predictive, and prescriptive AI.

Method: 提出了三种测试方法，检测排名反转，并在Scikit-Criteria库中实现，解决了通用场景下的实现挑战。

Result: 实现了三种测试方法，能够有效检测排名反转，并讨论了其在评估多准则决策方法中的作用。

Conclusion: 这些测试方法在多准则决策方法的评估中具有重要意义，有助于提升问题解决的可靠性。

Abstract: In Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, Rank Reversals are a serious problem
that can greatly affect the results of a Multi-Criteria Decision Method against
a particular set of alternatives. It is therefore useful to have a mechanism
that allows one to measure the performance of a method on a set of
alternatives. This idea could be taken further to build a global ranking of the
effectiveness of different methods to solve a problem. In this paper, we
present three tests that detect the presence of Rank Reversals, along with
their implementation in the Scikit-Criteria library. We also address the
complications that arise when implementing these tests for general scenarios
and the design considerations we made to handle them. We close with a
discussion about how these additions could play a major role in the judgment of
multi-criteria decision methods for problem solving.

Result: 展示了静态验证问题可转化为SHACL约束的（不）可满足性问题，并分析了其计算复杂性。

Conclusion: 通过原型实现验证了方法的可行性，为动态RDF图的分析提供了工具支持。

Abstract: SHACL (SHApe Constraint Language) is a W3C standardized constraint language
for RDF graphs. In this paper, we study SHACL validation in RDF graphs under
updates. We present a SHACL-based update language that can capture intuitive
and realistic modifications on RDF graphs and study the problem of static
validation under such updates. This problem asks to verify whether every graph
that validates a SHACL specification will still do so after applying a given
update sequence. More importantly, it provides a basis for further services for
reasoning about evolving RDF graphs. Using a regression technique that embeds
the update actions into SHACL constraints, we show that static validation under
updates can be reduced to (un)satisfiability of constraints in (a minor
extension of) SHACL. We analyze the computational complexity of the static
validation problem for SHACL and some key fragments. Finally, we present a
prototype implementation that performs static validation and other static
analysis tasks on SHACL constraints and demonstrate its behavior through
preliminary experiments.

Result: 生命周期基于分布式权威和迭代知识交换的主题，并与多个领先的伦理框架相关联。

Conclusion: 论文强调了参与式治理的重要性，并提出了未来研究的关键问题。

Abstract: Despite efforts to mitigate the inherent risks and biases of artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithms, these algorithms can disproportionately impact
culturally marginalized groups. A range of approaches has been proposed to
address or reduce these risks, including the development of ethical guidelines
and principles for responsible AI, as well as technical solutions that promote
algorithmic fairness. Drawing on design justice, expansive learning theory, and
recent empirical work on participatory AI, we argue that mitigating these harms
requires a fundamental re-architecture of the AI production pipeline. This
re-design should center co-production, diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), and
multidisciplinary collaboration. We introduce an augmented AI lifecycle
consisting of five interconnected phases: co-framing, co-design,
co-implementation, co-deployment, and co-maintenance. The lifecycle is informed
by four multidisciplinary workshops and grounded in themes of distributed
authority and iterative knowledge exchange. Finally, we relate the proposed
lifecycle to several leading ethical frameworks and outline key research
questions that remain for scaling participatory governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类评估者存在偏见和不可靠性，传统一致性指标无法充分保证标注数据的质量，尤其是在教育AI应用中。

Method: 提出五种补充评估方法，包括多标签标注方案、专家方法和闭环验证等，强调外部有效性的重要性。

Result: 这些方法能比传统一致性指标更有效地生成高质量训练数据，提升模型对学生学习的预测性和实用性。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新思考标注质量和真实标准，优先考虑有效性和教育影响，而非仅依赖共识。

Abstract: Humans can be notoriously imperfect evaluators. They are often biased,
unreliable, and unfit to define "ground truth." Yet, given the surging need to
produce large amounts of training data in educational applications using AI,
traditional inter-rater reliability (IRR) metrics like Cohen's kappa remain
central to validating labeled data. IRR remains a cornerstone of many machine
learning pipelines for educational data. Take, for example, the classification
of tutors' moves in dialogues or labeling open responses in machine-graded
assessments. This position paper argues that overreliance on human IRR as a
gatekeeper for annotation quality hampers progress in classifying data in ways
that are valid and predictive in relation to improving learning. To address
this issue, we highlight five examples of complementary evaluation methods,
such as multi-label annotation schemes, expert-based approaches, and
close-the-loop validity. We argue that these approaches are in a better
position to produce training data and subsequent models that produce improved
student learning and more actionable insights than IRR approaches alone. We
also emphasize the importance of external validity, for example, by
establishing a procedure of validating tutor moves and demonstrating that it
works across many categories of tutor actions (e.g., providing hints). We call
on the field to rethink annotation quality and ground truth--prioritizing
validity and educational impact over consensus alone.

Motivation: 研究如何在AI系统中平衡权力，确保人类福祉与安全，避免权力失衡带来的风险。

Method: 采用部分公理化方法设计目标函数，考虑人类有限理性与社会规范，通过逆向归纳或多智能体强化学习计算指标。

Result: 在多种情境下验证目标函数的效果，发现其可能比直接效用目标更安全。

Conclusion: 软最大化人类权力指标可能是AI系统的有益目标，比直接效用目标更安全。

Abstract: Power is a key concept in AI safety: power-seeking as an instrumental goal,
sudden or gradual disempowerment of humans, power balance in human-AI
interaction and international AI governance. At the same time, power as the
ability to pursue diverse goals is essential for wellbeing.
  This paper explores the idea of promoting both safety and wellbeing by
forcing AI agents explicitly to empower humans and to manage the power balance
between humans and AI agents in a desirable way. Using a principled, partially
axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective
function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of
human power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social
norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals.
  We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or
approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given
world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric
in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental
sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly
maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a
beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct
utility-based objectives.

TL;DR: RL-PLUS通过结合内部探索与外部数据，提升LLM的推理能力，解决了RLVR的能力边界崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR因策略固有性和稀疏奖励难以突破LLM能力边界，甚至导致能力范围缩小。

Method: RL-PLUS整合多重重要性采样和探索优势函数，优化推理路径。

Result: 在六项数学推理基准和六项分布外任务中表现优异，性能提升21.1%至69.2%。

Conclusion: RL-PLUS有效解决能力边界崩溃问题，显著提升推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly
advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of
the base LLM, due to its inherently on-policy strategy with LLM's immense
action space and sparse reward. Further, RLVR can lead to the capability
boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this
problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel approach that synergizes internal
exploitation (i.e., Thinking) with external data (i.e., Learning) to achieve
stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models.
RL-PLUS integrates two core components: Multiple Importance Sampling to address
for distributional mismatch from external data, and an Exploration-Based
Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning
paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to
demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. The results
show that RL-PLUS achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing
RLVR methods on six math reasoning benchmarks and exhibits superior performance
on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks. It also achieves consistent and
significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative
improvements ranging from 21.1\% to 69.2\%. Moreover, Pass@k curves across
multiple benchmarks indicate that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability
boundary collapse problem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发一种能够通过实践和自我改进不断提升能力的智能代理系统，以应对知识发现任务中的挑战。

Method: MetaAgent从基础能力出发，通过生成帮助请求、路由工具、自我反思和知识蒸馏，动态优化其工作流程和知识库。

Conclusion: MetaAgent展示了自进化代理系统在通用知识发现任务中的潜力，为未来智能代理的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the
principle of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on
practice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal
workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking
abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural
language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by
a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts
self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into
concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts.
Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent
knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its
ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual,
data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent
incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing
model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging
knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp,
MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or
exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving
agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery. We provide our
source codes in https://github.com/qhjqhj00/MetaAgent.

Motivation: 探讨生成式代理（如LLM）是否能模拟人类基于内在动机的复杂行为。

Method: 通过任务生成实验比较人类与GPT-4o的行为模式。

Result: 人类任务生成受心理驱动因素影响，而LLM生成的任务缺乏社会性和物理性，偏向抽象。

Conclusion: LLM与人类认知存在核心差距，需在设计更人性化代理时融入内在动机和物理基础。

Abstract: Humans constantly generate a diverse range of tasks guided by internal
motivations. While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs)
aim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they
operate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a
task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent
(GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by
psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and
cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided
to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They
produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically
biased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived
as more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic
proficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals.We conclude
that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human
cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of
incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of
more human-aligned agents.

TL;DR: ReasonBench是一个专注于结构化图形推理任务的评估基准，用于测试视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂图形推理中的表现，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并提出优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注简单图形，而VLMs在复杂图形推理和抽象问题解决方面表现不足，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 提出ReasonBench基准，包含1,613个真实智力测试问题，覆盖位置、属性、数量和多元素任务。通过评估11种主流VLMs，提出DiaCoT和ReasonTune优化策略。

Result: 当前VLMs在复杂图形推理中存在显著局限性，优化策略使模型性能提升33.5%。

Conclusion: ReasonBench为VLMs在复杂图形推理中的评估提供了全面工具，优化策略显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of visual language models (VLMs) in graphic
reasoning tasks has become an important research topic. However, VLMs still
show obvious deficiencies in simulating human-level graphic reasoning
capabilities, especially in complex graphic reasoning and abstract problem
solving, which are less studied and existing studies only focus on simple
graphics. To evaluate the performance of VLMs in complex graphic reasoning, we
propose ReasonBench, the first evaluation benchmark focused on structured
graphic reasoning tasks, which includes 1,613 questions from real-world
intelligence tests. ReasonBench covers reasoning dimensions related to
location, attribute, quantity, and multi-element tasks, providing a
comprehensive evaluation of the performance of VLMs in spatial, relational, and
abstract reasoning capabilities. We benchmark 11 mainstream VLMs (including
closed-source and open-source models) and reveal significant limitations of
current models. Based on these findings, we propose a dual optimization
strategy: Diagrammatic Reasoning Chain (DiaCoT) enhances the interpretability
of reasoning by decomposing layers, and ReasonTune enhances the task
adaptability of model reasoning through training, all of which improves VLM
performance by 33.5\%. All experimental data and code are in the repository:

TL;DR: R1-Act是一种简单高效的后训练方法，通过结构化推理过程显式触发安全知识，显著提升大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现大型推理模型（LRMs）虽然具备足够的安全知识，但在推理过程中未能激活这些知识，导致安全隐患。

Method: 提出R1-Act方法，通过结构化推理显式触发安全知识，仅需少量训练数据和短时间训练。

Result: R1-Act在多个LRM模型上表现出强大的安全改进和推理性能保持，优于现有对齐方法。

Conclusion: R1-Act具有鲁棒性、可扩展性和实际效率，为解决LRM安全问题提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Although large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities on complex tasks, recent studies reveal that these models
frequently fulfill harmful user instructions, raising significant safety
concerns. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of LRM safety
risks and find that models already possess sufficient safety knowledge but fail
to activate it during reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose R1-Act, a
simple and efficient post-training method that explicitly triggers safety
knowledge through a structured reasoning process. R1-Act achieves strong safety
improvements while preserving reasoning performance, outperforming prior
alignment methods. Notably, it requires only 1,000 training examples and 90
minutes of training on a single RTX A6000 GPU. Extensive experiments across
multiple LRM backbones and sizes demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and
practical efficiency of our approach.

*Shixin Yi,Lin Shang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRGI框架通过视觉验证机制改进视觉语言模型的多步推理，减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT提示方法在视觉语言模型中生成的解释缺乏视觉内容支持，导致幻觉问题。

Method: CoRGI采用三阶段流程：生成文本推理链、提取视觉证据、综合生成验证答案。

Result: 在VCR基准测试中，CoRGI提升了Qwen-2.5VL和LLaVA-1.6的性能，并生成更准确的解释。

Conclusion: 视觉验证能增强多模态推理的鲁棒性，但后验验证框架存在潜在限制。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in improving reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs), but it often produces explanations that are
linguistically fluent yet lack grounding in visual content. We observe that
such hallucinations arise in part from the absence of an explicit verification
mechanism during multi-step reasoning. To address this, we propose
\textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with
\textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a modular framework that introduces
visual verification into the reasoning process. CoRGI follows a three-stage
pipeline: it first generates a textual reasoning chain, then extracts
supporting visual evidence for each reasoning step via a dedicated module
(VEVM), and finally synthesizes the textual rationale with visual evidence to
generate a grounded, verified answer. The framework can be integrated with
existing VLMs without end-to-end retraining. We evaluate CoRGI on the VCR
benchmark and find that it improves reasoning performance on two representative
open-source VLM backbones, Qwen-2.5VL and LLaVA-1.6. Ablation studies confirm
the contribution of each step in the verification module, and human evaluations
suggest that CoRGI leads to more factual and helpful explanations. We also
examine alternative designs for the visual verification step and discuss
potential limitations of post-hoc verification frameworks. These findings
highlight the importance of grounding intermediate reasoning steps in visual
evidence to enhance the robustness of multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于心智理论（ToM）的多智能体协作方法，通过主动推理实现，无需任务特定的共享生成模型或显式通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体协作中如何理解并推理其他智能体的信念和目标的问题，提升协作效率。

Method: 扩展了基于推理树的规划算法，通过递归推理探索联合策略空间，智能体维护自身和他人的信念与目标表示。

Result: 在碰撞避免和觅食任务中，ToM智能体表现出更好的协作能力，能避免碰撞并减少冗余行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为人工智能的实践应用提供了新思路，并为ToM的计算机制提供了见解。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to multi-agent cooperation by implementing theory
of mind (ToM) within active inference. ToM - the ability to understand that
others can have differing knowledge and goals - enables agents to reason about
others' beliefs while planning their own actions. Unlike previous active
inference approaches to multi-agent cooperation, our method neither relies on
task-specific shared generative models nor requires explicit communication,
while being generalisable. In our framework, the ToM-equipped agent maintains
distinct representations of its own and others' beliefs and goals. We extend
the sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to systematically
explore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. Our approach is
evaluated through collision avoidance and foraging task simulations. Results
demonstrate that ToM-equipped agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM
counterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts.
Crucially, ToM agents accomplish this by inferring others' beliefs solely from
observable behaviour. This work advances practical applications in artificial
intelligence while providing computational insights into ToM.

Abstract: General AI Agents are increasingly recognized as foundational frameworks for
the next generation of artificial intelligence, enabling complex reasoning, web
interaction, coding, and autonomous research capabilities. However, current
agent systems are either closed-source or heavily reliant on a variety of paid
APIs and proprietary tools, limiting accessibility and reproducibility for the

fully open-source and (to the maximum extent) free multi-module agent framework
designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents.
Within Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of
high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the
construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key
domains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel
strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent
robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving
state-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our
8B-parameter open-source model surpasses previous leading systems such as
WebDancer and WebSailor, establishing a new performance standard for
accessible, high-capability AI agents. Code is available at

Motivation: 研究LLMs在数学领域的潜力，尤其是形式化证明中的表现，以揭示其推理机制和监督方式的局限性。

Method: 通过分析最新模型和基准测试，探讨LLMs在形式化与数学问题解决中的权衡、证明生成的脆弱性原因及其逻辑状态表示能力。

Result: 发现LLMs在形式化数学证明中的表现不如代码合成，揭示了其推理和监督的深层问题。

Conclusion: 论文旨在明确当前LLMs在数学领域的局限性，并提出可能的扩展方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in structured
reasoning and symbolic tasks, with coding emerging as a particular area of
strength. This success has sparked growing interest in applying LLMs to
mathematics, both in informal problem-solving and formal theorem proving.
However, progress in formal mathematics has proven to be significantly more
difficult, despite surface-level similarities between programming and proof
construction. This discrepancy raises important questions about how LLMs
``reason'', how they are supervised, and whether they internally track a notion
of computational or deductive state. In this article, we address the
state-of-the-art of the discipline, focusing on recent models and benchmarks,
and explore three central issues at the intersection of machine learning and
mathematical cognition: (i) the trade-offs between formal and informal
mathematics as training domains; (ii) the deeper reasons why proof generation
remains more brittle than code synthesis; (iii) and the question of whether
LLMs represent, or merely mimic, a notion of evolving logical state. Our goal
is not to draw hard boundaries, but to identify where the current limits lie,
and how they might be extended.

*Haoyu Wang,Chris M. Poskitt,Jun Sun,Jiali Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pro2Guard是一个基于概率可达性分析的主动运行时安全框架，用于预测和预防LLM代理的不安全行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则的安全系统（如AgentSpec）缺乏预见性，难以应对长期依赖和分布变化，因此需要一种更主动的安全框架。

Method: Pro2Guard将代理行为抽象为符号状态，并从执行轨迹中学习离散时间马尔可夫链（DTMC），在运行时通过估计到达不安全状态的概率来预测风险。

Result: 在家庭代理和自动驾驶场景中，Pro2Guard分别实现了93.6%和100%的风险预测，并能提前干预。

Conclusion: Pro2Guard通过概率分析和语义检查，显著提升了LLM代理的安全性，同时保持了任务完成率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit powerful autonomous capabilities
across domains such as robotics, virtual assistants, and web automation.
However, their stochastic behavior introduces significant safety risks that are
difficult to anticipate. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as
AgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond
only when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems
lack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution
shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime
enforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis.
Pro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a
Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it
anticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe
states, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted
risk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity
checks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability
while approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard
extensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and
autonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early
on up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes
(e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to
80.4% task completion. In autonomous driving scenarios, Pro2Guard achieves 100%
prediction of traffic law violations and collisions, anticipating risks up to
38.66 seconds ahead.

TL;DR: MultiSHAP是一个模型无关的可解释性框架，利用Shapley交互指数量化多模态AI模型中视觉和文本元素的协同效应，适用于开源和闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态AI模型在需要整合多种模态信息的任务中表现出色，但其“黑盒”特性在高风险应用中部署时面临可解释性和可信度的挑战。

Method: MultiSHAP通过Shapley交互指数，将多模态预测归因于视觉和文本元素的成对交互，提供实例级和数据集级解释。

Result: 实验证实MultiSHAP能准确捕捉跨模态推理机制，实际案例研究展示了其实用性。

Conclusion: MultiSHAP为复杂多模态AI模型的可解释性提供了通用解决方案，并可扩展到两种以上模态。

Abstract: Multimodal AI models have achieved impressive performance in tasks that
require integrating information from multiple modalities, such as vision and
language. However, their "black-box" nature poses a major barrier to deployment
in high-stakes applications where interpretability and trustworthiness are
essential. How to explain cross-modal interactions in multimodal AI models
remains a major challenge. While existing model explanation methods, such as
attention map and Grad-CAM, offer coarse insights into cross-modal
relationships, they cannot precisely quantify the synergistic effects between
modalities, and are limited to open-source models with accessible internal
weights. Here we introduce MultiSHAP, a model-agnostic interpretability
framework that leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute multimodal
predictions to pairwise interactions between fine-grained visual and textual
elements (such as image patches and text tokens), while being applicable to
both open- and closed-source models. Our approach provides: (1) instance-level
explanations that reveal synergistic and suppressive cross-modal effects for
individual samples - "why the model makes a specific prediction on this input",
and (2) dataset-level explanation that uncovers generalizable interaction
patterns across samples - "how the model integrates information across
modalities". Experiments on public multimodal benchmarks confirm that MultiSHAP
faithfully captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, while real-world case
studies demonstrate its practical utility. Our framework is extensible beyond
two modalities, offering a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal
AI models.

Conclusion: 该框架通过构建显式临床知识，显著提升了预咨询问卷的质量和效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Pre-consultation is a critical component of effective healthcare delivery.
However, generating comprehensive pre-consultation questionnaires from complex,
voluminous Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is a challenging task. Direct
Large Language Model (LLM) approaches face difficulties in this task,
particularly regarding information completeness, logical order, and
disease-level synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-stage
LLM-driven framework: Stage 1 extracts atomic assertions (key facts with
timing) from EMRs; Stage 2 constructs personal causal networks and synthesizes
disease knowledge by clustering representative networks from an EMR corpus;
Stage 3 generates tailored personal and standardized disease-specific
questionnaires based on these structured representations. This framework
overcomes limitations of direct methods by building explicit clinical
knowledge. Evaluated on a real-world EMR dataset and validated by clinical
experts, our method demonstrates superior performance in information coverage,
diagnostic relevance, understandability, and generation time, highlighting its
practical potential to enhance patient information collection.

Motivation: 当前AI在生成交互式音频-视觉内容（如视频游戏）时面临挑战，缺乏自动化评估指标且难以处理复杂内容。

Method: 提出AVR-Eval作为多媒体内容质量的相对评估指标，并开发AVR-Agent多代理系统生成JavaScript代码。

Result: AVR-Agent生成的内容在实验中表现优于单次生成内容，但模型未能有效利用自定义资源和反馈。

Conclusion: 人类与机器在内容创作方式上存在根本差异，当前模型尚无法充分利用高质量资源和反馈。

Abstract: While AI excels at generating text, audio, images, and videos, creating
interactive audio-visual content such as video games remains challenging.
Current LLMs can generate JavaScript games and animations, but lack automated
evaluation metrics and struggle with complex content that normally requires
teams of humans working for many months (multi-shot, multi-agents) using assets
made by artists. To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a
multi-agent system.
  We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using
Audio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video,
and audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing
evaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies
good from broken or mismatched content.
  We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a
bank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models). The coding agent selects
relevant assets, generates multiple initial codes, uses AVR-Eval to identify
the best version, and iteratively improves it through omni-modal agent feedback
from the AVR.
  We run experiments on games and animations with AVR-Eval (win rate of content
A against B). We find that content generated by AVR-Agent has a significantly
higher win rate against content made through one-shot generation. However,
models struggle to leverage custom assets and AVR feedback effectively, showing
no higher win rate. This reveals a critical gap: while humans benefit from
high-quality assets and audio-visual feedback, current coding models do not
seem to utilize these resources as effectively, highlighting fundamental
differences between human and machine content creation approaches.

Result: 实验表明，MB-VLGC在合成和真实数据集上显著优于现有方法，适用于各种时间序列数据。

Conclusion: MB-VLGC框架解决了频率依赖因果延迟的问题，具有广泛适用性，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in time series is fundamental to many
domains, including neuroscience, economics, and behavioral science. Granger
causality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time
series. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag
assumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex
systems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses
this limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time
lags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal
interactions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.
For example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region
with a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we
formalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a
novel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling
frequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC,
demonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference
pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our
framework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and
real-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time
series data. Code and datasets are publicly available.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence-driven adaptive learning systems are reshaping
education through data-driven adaptation of learning experiences. Yet many of
these systems lack transparency, offering limited insight into how decisions
are made. Most explainable AI (XAI) techniques focus on technical outputs but
neglect user roles and comprehension. This paper proposes a hybrid framework
that integrates traditional XAI techniques with generative AI models and user
personalisation to generate multimodal, personalised explanations tailored to
user needs. We redefine explainability as a dynamic communication process
tailored to user roles and learning goals. We outline the framework's design,
key XAI limitations in education, and research directions on accuracy,
fairness, and personalisation. Our aim is to move towards explainable AI that
enhances transparency while supporting user-centred experiences.

Motivation: 当前社交媒体的AI推荐缺乏针对用户特定需求的解释，导致用户不理解推荐原因，降低了推荐的价值。

Method: 提出一个视觉解释系统，结合用户需求和上下文，提供不同形式的解释（如技术详细版和简化版），并首次在同一流程中调整解释风格（视觉vs数字）和粒度（专家vs普通用户）。

Result: 通过30名X用户的公开试点验证系统对决策和信任的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为社交媒体推荐提供了更透明和用户友好的解释，有望提升用户体验和信任。

Abstract: Social media platforms today strive to improve user experience through AI
recommendations, yet the value of such recommendations vanishes as users do not
understand the reasons behind them. This issue arises because explainability in
social media is general and lacks alignment with user-specific needs. In this
vision paper, we outline a user-segmented and context-aware explanation layer
by proposing a visual explanation system with diverse explanation methods. The
proposed system is framed by the variety of user needs and contexts, showing
explanations in different visualized forms, including a technically detailed
version for AI experts and a simplified one for lay users. Our framework is the
first to jointly adapt explanation style (visual vs. numeric) and granularity
(expert vs. lay) inside a single pipeline. A public pilot with 30 X users will
validate its impact on decision-making and trust.

Conclusion: 该方法为生成内容检测提供了通用、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models achieve remarkable results in multiple data domains,
including images and texts, among other examples. Unfortunately, malicious
users exploit synthetic media for spreading misinformation and disseminating
deepfakes. Consequently, the need for robust and stable fake detectors is
pressing, especially when new generative models appear everyday. While the
majority of existing work train classifiers that discriminate between real and
fake information, such tools typically generalize only within the same family
of generators and data modalities, yielding poor results on other generative
classes and data domains. Towards a universal classifier, we propose the use of
large pre-trained multi-modal models for the detection of generative content.
Effectively, we show that the latent code of these models naturally captures
information discriminating real from fake. Building on this observation, we
demonstrate that linear classifiers trained on these features can achieve
state-of-the-art results across various modalities, while remaining
computationally efficient, fast to train, and effective even in few-shot
settings. Our work primarily focuses on fake detection in audio and images,
achieving performance that surpasses or matches that of strong baseline
methods.
