The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based\nmetaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid\nloss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into\nlocal optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address\nthe shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance\nlearning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three\nstrategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning\nstrategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population\ndiversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the\nbootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the\ntendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early\nsearch stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the\nhard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the\nweighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search\nability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is\nproposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the\nstagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus\nenhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed\nMRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test\nset, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the\nFriedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The\nresults show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic\nRIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence\nspeed and stability."}

To address these limitations, this study\npresents an enhanced educational competition optimizer (IECO-MCO) utilizing\nmulti-covariance learning operators. In IECO, three distinct covariance\nlearning operators are introduced to improve the performance of ECO.

As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical\nto evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through\nwhich they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,\ndifferent agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,\nsuch as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas\nlarge language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we\ncompare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in\na dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition\ncomparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral\ndynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive\noptimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can\nachieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor\nconservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ\nmore strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors.

Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered\nin the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,\nsynchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily\non coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,\nlaw enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in\nphysical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit\ncommunication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial\ncoordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and\nadaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative\nonline search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and\nteam members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and\ncoordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by\nmeasuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements\nwithin shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136\nparticipants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.\nResults show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while\nadaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,\nsuggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal.

Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show\nthat ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their\ncapacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data.

While recent studies have\nshown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing\napproaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex\nframeworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image\nSignal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW\nimages in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object\ndetection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP\npipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone\nmapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized\nthrough task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware\nadaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB\nconversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP\npipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that\nfacilitates cooperation between sub-modules.

Prior approaches face critical limitations: some\nrely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined\ntoolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single\nreasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate\nsteps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the\nuse of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address\nthis, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual\ninformation of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is\nthat this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation\nconsistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is\nunsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a\nlearnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved\nwith code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive\nframework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct\nvisual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with\nreinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a\ndata-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical\nhallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each\nstrategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode.

The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based\nmetaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid\nloss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into\nlocal optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address\nthe shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance\nlearning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three\nstrategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning\nstrategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population\ndiversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the\nbootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the\ntendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early\nsearch stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the\nhard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the\nweighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search\nability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is\nproposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the\nstagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus\nenhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed\nMRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test\nset, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the\nFriedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The\nresults show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic\nRIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence\nspeed and stability."}

The core idea is extending the Average\nPrecision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and\nadaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.\nSecond, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose\nthe object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.\nSpecifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via\ncross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks\nsoundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in\nhttps://github.com/KID-7391/CoTAP."}

Multi-modal medical image fusion\nintegrates useful information from different complementary medical images with\ndifferent modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and\nobjectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical\ndiagnosis.

To tackle this issue, we introduce\nFlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate\nflexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal\nand tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse\ntransforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition\ninputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion\nprocess and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the\nExpectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration\nprocess, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal\ninformation from source images, independently of the number of input images.

Our\nexperiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS\ndataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to\ndiverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to\npartial 2D / 3D observations."}

However, diffusion using this optimal\ndenoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to\ncapture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to\ncharacterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,\nproposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that\nresemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method\nhypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of\nconvolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence\nincorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we\npresent evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a\nstatistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of\nconvolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal\nparametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep\nneural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that\nthis locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural\nimage datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser\nthat better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior\nexpert-crafted alternative."}

However, the scalability and\nreal-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the\nscarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets\nprovide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,\ndiversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes\nwith ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \\textbf{SpatialVID}, a\ndataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,\ncamera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,\ndepth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours\nof raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical\nfiltering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent\nannotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic\ninformation, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured\ncaptions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data\nstatistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model\ngeneralization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video\nand 3D vision research community."}

To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M\nand PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).\nFLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality\nFLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)\ndescriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are\norganized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text\nrendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation\nChain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation\nsteps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the\ncommunity with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial\nlabs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct\ntracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through\ncarefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for\nnuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image\naesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench\nreveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring\nimprovement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to\ncatalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation. Project page:\nhttps://flux-reason-6m.github.io/ ."}

In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in\nintegrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables\nflexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.\nTherefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial\nIntelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,\nwe first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in\ncomputational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational\nframework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core\nbiological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired\nmultimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric\nconversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.\nTogether, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial\nreasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we\nconduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their\nrelevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the\ndevelopment of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further\nexamine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application\ndomains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we\noutline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that\ncan generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.\nWe hope this work will benefit the research community with a\nneuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway.
