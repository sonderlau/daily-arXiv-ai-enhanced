Monthly temperature, precipitation, and drought index data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) U.S. Climate Divisional Dataset (nClimDiv, 1895--2024) were analyzed to detect periodic structures and their evolution over time. By comparing harmonic-based models with linear regression trends, this research evaluates the explanatory power of cyclic components in reproducing and predicting observed variability. Results show that U.S. climate records exhibit dominant periodicities near one year (seasonal) and 2--7 years (associated with the El Nino--Southern Oscillation, ENSO), and that incorporating harmonic terms significantly improves model performance across most states and variables. The findings indicate that U.S. climate fluctuations are characterized by quasi-stationary oscillations rather than purely monotonic trends. Overall, the main implication is that frequency-aware models provide measurably better predictive skill than trend-only approaches and should be incorporated into seasonal outlooks, drought monitoring, and resource planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u548c\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u6790\u7f8e\u56fd\u6c14\u5019\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e74\u5468\u671f\u548c2-7\u5e74ENSO\u5468\u671f\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8c10\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u7ebf\u6027\u8d8b\u52bf\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7f8e\u56fd\u6c14\u5019\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6210\u5206\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6c14\u5019\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u529b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8c10\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u548c\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u5bf9NOAA\u7684nClimDiv\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff081895-2024\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6708\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u964d\u6c34\u548c\u5e72\u65f1\u6307\u6570\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8c10\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u6c14\u5019\u8bb0\u5f55\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4ee5\u4e00\u5e74\uff08\u5b63\u8282\u6027\uff09\u548c2-7\u5e74\uff08\u4e0eENSO\u76f8\u5173\uff09\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u8c10\u6ce2\u9879\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5dde\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u6c14\u5019\u6ce2\u52a8\u4ee5\u51c6\u5e73\u7a33\u632f\u8361\u800c\u975e\u7eaf\u5355\u8c03\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5e94\u7eb3\u5165\u5b63\u8282\u5c55\u671b\u3001\u5e72\u65f1\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

Using simulations from the TIEGCM V3.0 model, a key finding reveals that transforming vertical winds in height coordinates onto constant pressure surfaces contain a substantial lifting component; an aspect often overlooked in previous research. This distinction is critical for internal energy assessments, as vertical winds defined in pressure coordinates directly contribute to the adiabatic heating or cooling rates while only a portion of the vertical wind in height coordinates contributes to these energy changes. These differences are demonstrated through schematic representations of thermodynamic control volumes that model a column of thermospheric gas undergoing various energy transfer processes. Accurately determining the portion of observed vertical winds that affect internal energy requires clear understanding between height and pressure surfaces; a nontrivial challenge in observational contexts. Furthermore, applying the generalized vertical coordinate framework to airglow emissions in the upper thermosphere uncovers an inherent ambiguity: vertical winds inferred from airglow observations may not align with those defined on pressure or altitude surfaces. This insight suggests that discrepancies in the behavior and magnitude of vertical winds derived from FPI observations of red-line emissions in the upper thermosphere are due to poorly known relations between the emission structure relative to pressure or height surfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u4e49\u5782\u76f4\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u63a7\u5236\u4f53\u79ef\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u70ed\u5c42\u5782\u76f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5750\u6807\u548c\u538b\u529b\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u5782\u76f4\u98ce\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u91cf\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u70ed\u5c42\u5782\u76f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u89e3\u91ca\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5750\u6807\u548c\u538b\u529b\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u5782\u76f4\u98ce\u5206\u91cf\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u80fd\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528TIEGCM V3.0\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u63a7\u5236\u4f53\u79ef\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5750\u6807\u548c\u538b\u529b\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u5782\u76f4\u98ce\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8d21\u732e\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u98ce\u53d8\u6362\u5230\u7b49\u538b\u9762\u65f6\u5305\u542b\u663e\u8457\u7684\u62ac\u5347\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u53ea\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u98ce\u8d21\u732e\u4e8e\u7edd\u70ed\u52a0\u70ed/\u51b7\u5374\u7387\u3002\u6c14\u8f89\u89c2\u6d4b\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u98ce\u4e0e\u538b\u529b/\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5750\u6807\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u98ce\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c2\u6d4b\u5782\u76f4\u98ce\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u538b\u529b\u9762\uff0c\u6c14\u8f89\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u98ce\u5dee\u5f02\u6e90\u4e8e\u53d1\u5c04\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u538b\u529b/\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9762\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002"}}

It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts.

The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization.

A paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it: planning through belief-intent co-evolution", "summary": "We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Inspired by cognitive science, we propose that effective planning arises not from reconstructing the world, but from the co-evolution of belief and intent within a minimal set of semantically rich tokens. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, 11k+ samples) reveal three principles: (1) sparse intent tokens alone achieve 0.487 m ADE, demonstrating strong performance without future prediction; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.382 m, a 21.6% improvement, showing that performance emerges from cognitive planning; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss degrades performance, confirming that task-driven belief-intent co-evolution suffices under reliable perception inputs. Crucially, we observe the emergence of cognitive consistency: through prolonged training, the model spontaneously develops stable token dynamics that balance current perception (belief) and future goals (intent). This process, accompanied by \"temporal fuzziness,\" enables robustness under uncertainty and continuous self-optimization. Our work establishes a new paradigm: intelligence lies not in pixel fidelity, but in the tokenized duality of belief and intent. By reframing planning as understanding rather than reaction, TIWM bridges the gap between world models and VLA systems, paving the way for foresightful agents that plan through imagination.

However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis.

We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance.

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\\sim$90\\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\\sim$80\\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur.

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fr\u00e9chet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation.

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u5185\u5b58\u5e93\u800c\u975e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5b50\u5185\u5b58\u5e93\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5728MVTec AD\u548cVisa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u6784\u5efa\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u5b50\u5185\u5b58\u5e93\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u5171\u4eab\u7edf\u4e00\u5185\u5b58\u5e93\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u4e2d\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVTec AD\u548cVisa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52300.972\u548c0.891\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7AUROC\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5b50\u7eb8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u5728GitHub\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7transformer\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86AI\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u7269\u79cd\u9012\u5f52\u901a\u4fe1\u76f8\u9047\u65f6\u7684\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u5176\u4ed6\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u901a\u4fe1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u76f8\u9047\u53ef\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u626d\u66f2\u7269\u79cd\u95f4\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u54f2\u5b66\u5bb6Yuk Hui\u5173\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u6027\u548c\u5076\u7136\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5206\u6790AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u7269\u79cd\u901a\u4fe1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u5076\u7136\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u662f\u4e2d\u7acb\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5176\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u906e\u853d\u6216\u626d\u66f2\u5176\u4ed6\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66AI\u4ece\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u5f0f\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5916\u4ea4\u6027\u76f8\u9047\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise.

However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction.

Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4fdd\u62a4\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533f\u540d\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u79c1\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u6cc4\u9732\u4e86\u654f\u611f\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u80a4\u8272\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u670d\u88c5\u7b49\uff09\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533f\u540d\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u5757\uff08AAM\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u7247\u6bb5\u7ea7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9690\u79c1\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c1135%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6548\u7528\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks.

Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a32x32\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4ee53-5\u500d\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u800c\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u751f\u6210\uff09\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528IsoFlops\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u9ad8\u8fbe7e19 FLOPs\uff0c\u572832x32\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u3001ImageNet\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cFr\u00e9chet\u8ddd\u79bb\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "1) \u5728\u56fa\u5b9a32x32\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4ee53-5\u500d\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\uff1b2) \u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b3) \u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u6bcf\u5e74\u589e\u957f4-5\u500d\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u4e94\u5e74\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u800c\u975e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002"}}

Code and data available at https://github.com/alvco/Founding_Fathers_AI", "summary": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ba1\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u589e\u91cf\u641c\u7d22(GIS)\u6765\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc(RR)\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6d41\u7545\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4ecd\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u4ece\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684LLM\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3LLM\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0e\u5305\u542b\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u5c42\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u3002\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4f4d\u7f8e\u56fd\u5f00\u56fd\u5143\u52cb\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4eba\u7269\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528RAG\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f53\u4ee3\u653f\u6cbb\u8bae\u9898\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e5d\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4ef2\u88c1\u5206\u6570\u4e3a88.3\u5bf971.7\u3002\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u5728\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u548c\u6218\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u662f\u901a\u8fc7GIS\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Venkatesh Babu"], "title": "Harnessing Diffusion-Generated Synthetic Images for Fair Image Classification", "comment": null, "summary": "Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\uff09\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u591a\u4e2aDreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8868\u793a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbStable Diffusion\u548c\u53ef\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u5747\u800c\u7ee7\u627f\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4eba\u8138\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u91d1\u53d1\u4e0e\u5973\u6027\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\u4f1a\u5f3a\u5316\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528Stable Diffusion\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff08LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2aDreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u8fc7\u591a\u7684\u7ec4\u5185\u53d8\u5316\u6240\u6df9\u6ca1\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7fa4\u4f53\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbStable Diffusion\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982Group-DRO\uff09\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u89c1\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAKER\u7cfb\u7edf\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u6b65LLM\u4efb\u52a1\u96f6\u9519\u8bef\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5fae\u4ee3\u7406\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6267\u884c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6570\u767e\u6b65\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6781\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u7531\u4e13\u6ce8\u5fae\u4ee3\u7406\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u6b65\u7684LLM\u4efb\u52a1\u4e14\u96f6\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86LLM\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u89e3\u4ee3\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDAPs\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aArgus\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u97e7\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5371\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u516c\u5171\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5404\u79cd\u9a7e\u9a76\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u5371\u9669\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u54cd\u5e94\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "Argus\u6846\u67b6\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7ADS\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5f53EGO\u8f66\u8f86\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5371\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u5668\u65e0\u7f1d\u63a5\u7ba1\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4e0eTCP\u3001UniAD\u548cVAD\u4e09\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u7aef\u5230\u7aefADS\u96c6\u6210\u540e\uff0cArgus\u5c06\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u5206\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe150.30%\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u4e8664.38%\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Argus\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002"}}

However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast.

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\\%$.

Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input.

Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details.

However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components.

However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios.

However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties.

Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model.

These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u5c42\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c42\u548cAI\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u3001\u6d41\u7a0b\u5de5\u4e1a\uff09\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e3b\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5c42\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c42\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u8f93\u5165\uff0cAI\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5c42\u7528\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u5185\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u671f\u95f4\u56e0\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53cc\u5c42\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u51b3\u7b56\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8f93\u51fa\u3002"}}

Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \\& Eosin (H\\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task.

To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch.

Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f(ACKD)\u6846\u67b6SemBridge\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f31\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0b\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u9065\u611f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u914d\u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bf9\u79f0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f(SCKD)\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5f31\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f(ACKD)\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSemBridge\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5b66\u751f\u53cb\u597d\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u83b7\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u6559\u5e08\u6837\u672c\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u4f18\u5316\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u8def\u5f84\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e7\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SemBridge\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f31\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u9065\u611f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate.

We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\\% labels on PubLayNet.

This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures.

However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge.

Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.\n  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.\n  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.\n  The benchmark is publicly available at https://hycodev.com/dataset/barrierbench", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c4f\u969c\u8bc1\u4e66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u63d0\u51fa\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5019\u9009\u8bc1\u4e66\uff0c\u5728100\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523090%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5c4f\u969c\u8bc1\u4e66\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u3001\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u677f\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u96c6\u6210SMT\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c4f\u969c-\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u534f\u540c\u5408\u6210\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u8bc1\u4e66\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728BarrierBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5305\u542b100\u4e2a\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u8bc1\u4e66\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8d85\u8fc790%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d1\u5e03BarrierBench\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions.

However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis.

Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM).

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use.

While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability.

The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience.

However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively.

However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies.

NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective.

Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM.

However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding.

In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency.

While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to \"identity mapping\", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid \"identity mapping\" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection.

Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy.

Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common \"ghosting effect.\" It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures.

To address these issues, we propose 4KDehazeFlow, a novel method based on Flow Matching and the Haze-Aware vector field. This method models the dehazing process as a progressive optimization of continuous vector field flow, providing efficient data-driven adaptive nonlinear color transformation for high-quality dehazing. Specifically, our method has the following advantages: 1) 4KDehazeFlow is a general method compatible with various deep learning networks, without relying on any specific network architecture. 2) We propose a learnable 3D lookup table (LUT) that encodes haze transformation parameters into a compact 3D mapping matrix, enabling efficient inference through precomputed mappings. 3) We utilize a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver to stably solve the dehazing flow field through an accurate step-by-step iterative method, effectively suppressing artifacts.

While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b(GLP)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u652f\u6301\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff08\u91cd\u5efa\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89c6\u9891-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PAN\u5411\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u62df\u3002"}}

This paper introduces VietMEAgent, a multimodal explainable framework engineered for Vietnamese cultural understanding. The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled.

Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL.

However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse.

With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization.

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \\textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps.

However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes.

Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \\Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies.

Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72D-3D\u914d\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0e\u672f\u524dCT\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u672f\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u547c\u5438\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u53d8\u5f02\u548cCT\u4e0e\u8eab\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u7aa5\u955cRGB\u5e27\u4e0eCT\u6e32\u67d3\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee2.65mm\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee0.19rad\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8fdb\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Zelek"], "title": "DreamPose3D: Hallucinative Diffusion with Prompt Learning for 3D Human Pose Estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.

We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively.

However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DermBench\u57fa\u51c6\u548cDermEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaDermBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5305\u542b4000\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u53d9\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3DermEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff08\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53d9\u8ff0\u4ea7\u751f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6279\u8bc4\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u57284500\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDermBench\u548cDermEval\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.251\u548c0.117\uff08\u6ee1\u52065\u5206\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "DermBench\u548cDermEval\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms.

This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design. The hardware processing unit comprises engines such as convolution, grid sampling, upsample, etc. Parallelization optimization strategies like double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling are employed to fully exploit the resources of FPGA.

The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors.

In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality.

When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors.

Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "FQ-PETR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9PETR\u7cfb\u52173D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u53cc\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728W8A8\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d6e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u4ec51%\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u548c75%\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u91cf\u5316\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) QFPE\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7528LiDAR\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5355\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u66ff\u4ee3\u591a\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2) DULUT\u53cc\u67e5\u627e\u8868\uff0c\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ea7\u8054\u7ebf\u6027\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u8fd1\u4f3c\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff1b3) QANS\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\uff0c\u5728softmax\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u540e\u6267\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728PETR\u3001StreamPETR\u3001PETRv2\u3001MV2d\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cFQ-PETR\u5728W8A8\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d6e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u4ec51%\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u8fbe75%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u548cQAT\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FQ-PETR\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u76843D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edcTDCNet\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u5377\u79ef\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408TDC\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\u5f31\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c3D\u5377\u79ef\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TDCNet\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u5377\u79ef\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e76\u884cTDC\u5757\u6355\u83b7\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\uff09\u548cTDC\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5728TDC\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u5e76\u884c3D\u4e3b\u5e72\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u4f9d\u8d56\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728IRSTD-UAV\u548c\u516c\u5171\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTDCNet\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TDCNet\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Preprint, under review for Eurographics 2026", "summary": "Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OUGS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u65e0\u5173\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4ece3D\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e32\u67d3\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u4f20\u64ad\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863DGS\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "OUGS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u534f\u540c\u6307\u5bfc\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u540c\u6784CNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1. \u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u5dee\u5f02\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2. \u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60ViT\u4e0eCNN\u6559\u5e08\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728HMDB51\u3001EPIC-KITCHENS-100\u548cKinetics-400\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728HMDB51\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u83b7\u5f975.95%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u540c\u6784\u6559\u5e08\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability. This work will be continuously expanded to encompass more downstream applications, and the corresponding resources are intended to be shared through https://github.com/VinyehShaw/UniEqui.", "AI": {"tldr": "vMFCoOp\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u51af\u00b7\u7c73\u585e\u65af-\u8d39\u5e0c\u5c14\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50LLM\u548cCLIP\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u548cCLIP\u53d8\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u9006\u4f30\u8ba1\u51af\u00b7\u7c73\u585e\u65af-\u8d39\u5e0c\u5c14\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u610fLLM\u548cCLIP\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u572814\u4e2a\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u300112\u79cd\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u548c13\u4e2a\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "vMFCoOp\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the \"tunable knobs\" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves on prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast. To the best of our knowledge, RF-DETR (2x-large) is the first real-time detector to surpass 60 AP on COCO.
