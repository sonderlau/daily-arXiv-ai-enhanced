To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel\nalignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts\nintractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic\ninversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new\npost-training paradigm.

While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages. The \\emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token\nAdapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible\nfeature spaces.

The nature of this\nNIW--mesoscale interaction depends on how dispersive the waves are. For weakly\ndispersive waves, ray tracing suggests that the NIW frequency should be shifted\nby $\\frac{1}{2}\\zeta$, where $\\zeta$ is the mesoscale vorticity, and that the\nwaves are refracted into anticyclones. Strongly dispersive waves, in contrast,\nretain the large-scale structure of the wind forcing and exhibit a small\nnegative frequency shift. Previous in situ observational studies have indeed\nrevealed varying degrees of NIW--mesoscale interaction. Here, observations of\nNIWs from drifters are used to map the geography of NIW--mesoscale interactions\nglobally, and idealized simulations and a simple model are used to identify the\nunderlying physical processes. Almost everywhere in the ocean, with the notable\nexception of the North Pacific, the NIW frequency is strongly modulated by the\nmesoscale vorticity, with the slope of the frequency shift vs. vorticity taking\nvalues of approximately $0.4$. Concentration of NIW energy into anticyclones is\na common feature throughout the ocean.

While linear wave theory provides a first-order description\nof wave motion, real-world oceanic environments are governed by nonlinear\ninteractions that are responsible for a transfer of energy between waves of\ndifferent lengths. The pioneering research by O. Phillips, K. Hasselmann, and\nV. Zakharov in the 1960s introduced the concept that four-wave resonant\ninteractions serve as the primary mechanism for energy transfers among wave\ncomponents in oceanic surface wave fields. Although the presence and efficiency\nof these resonant interactions have been demonstrated in controlled determinist\nwave tank experiments, their direct identification in the real ocean, where a\nlarge number of random waves interact, has remained elusive. Here, using a\nstereoscopic system that enables the measurement of surface elevation in both\nspace and time, we provide experimental evidence of resonant interactions in\nocean wind waves. Our data not only reproduce the well-known figure-eight\npattern predicted by Phillips, but also reveal a continuum of different\nresonant configurations that closely match the theoretical predictions.

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation.

However, very few algorithms have been designed to\nexploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU\ncomputations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations\nin depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded\ndepth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of\nmodern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \\emph{Batch IDA*},\nan extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an\nextensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach\nused by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality\nguarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding\ntile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in\nDFS.

Designing intelligent systems with\nhuman-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial\nintelligence community.

In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often\nmeans retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,\nwhich increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific\napproaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver\n(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we\nprove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of\nestimating the predictability of target images in problem panels.

The experiments show that with a\nsingle round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning\nability across various AVR tasks.

This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)\nmethod for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous\nvehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:\nFirst, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,\neffectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease\nthe search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game\ntopology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a\ntopology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual\ninformation. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV\npenetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations\nencompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic\nperformance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL\nsuccessfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits\nsuperior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision\nsmoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates\ndecision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in\nboth mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios.

However,\naccording to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components\nare vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling\nlayers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency\nModulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency\nbefore downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.\nSpecifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and\ndesign a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to\nscale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the\nFrequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling\n(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency\ninformation through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves\nsegmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely\nand sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly\nintegrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural\nnetworks to transformers.

Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is\ncrucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video\ncompression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment\n(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability\nneeded to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high\ndynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an\neffective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality\nassessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the\nbackbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)\nVQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and\ntextural similarities between reference and distorted frames using\nintermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its\nquality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global\nmean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware\nrepresentation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we\npre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA\ndataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ\nan iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA\ndatasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental\nresults show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to\nexisting FR and NR VQA models.

In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias),\nan efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases\nduring TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the\nglobal bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning\nconsistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic\ncoherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation.

However, the attention\nmechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the\nstacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency\nvanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose\na novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention\nModulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to\nconsistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,\nDeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic\nsegmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation.

Existing methods regard the RGB\ndomain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such\nas daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the\ndomain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple\nsubdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper\nproposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In\nterms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)\nmodule in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content\ninformation being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can\ndecouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter\nbank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven\ndecoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling.

The central objective is\nto ascertain whether a suspicious black-box model has been pre-trained on a\nparticular unlabeled dataset, thereby assisting dataset owners in safeguarding\ntheir rights. DOV4MM is grounded in our empirical observation that when a model\nis pre-trained on the target dataset, the difficulty of reconstructing masked\ninformation within the embedding space exhibits a marked contrast to models not\npre-trained on that dataset. We validated the efficacy of DOV4MM through ten\nmasked image models on ImageNet-1K and four masked language models on\nWikiText-103. The results demonstrate that DOV4MM rejects the null hypothesis,\nwith a $p$-value considerably below 0.05, surpassing all prior approaches.

This\nleads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making\nthe model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper\nproposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature\nspace decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet\ntransform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by\nadjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through\nmulti-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature\nspace is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and\nmultiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo\nlow-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to\nimprove enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided\ncross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency\nbranches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting\nvaluable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the\nhigh-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is\nproposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset\nconsisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform\nillumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate\nthat our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while\neffectively recovering high-frequency information.

Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks\npostmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,\npreventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental\nimpairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.\nTherefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to\navoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of\nextremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could\nserve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and\ninvestigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely\nlow-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within\n24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult\nchest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative\nlearning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and\nlinear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing\nmodel with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of\n0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67\n$\\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet\ninitialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be\nimportant for BPD outcome prediction.

However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail\nto incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades\ndirectly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training\ndata for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through\ntwo main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse\nlongitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different\nurban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building\noutlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles\nthroughout the year and at different times of day.

Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to\nlearn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of\nedge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and\nincorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of\nshade.

However, existing approaches are limited to linear affine\ntransformations, hindering their ability to model complex color relationships.\nMeanwhile, while multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) excel at non-linear mappings,\ntraditional MLP-based methods employ globally shared parameters, which is hard\nto deal with localized variations. To overcome these dual challenges, we\npropose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM)\nframework.

DAM-QA\nalso achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer\nparameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These\nresults highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader\nVQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies.

Existing 3D generation\nprimarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded\nmodeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models,\nthe synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical\nproperties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like\nsimulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we\npropose \\textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset\ngeneration. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we\npresent PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically\nannotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material,\naffordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a\nscalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models,\nwhich enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2)\nFurthermore, we propose \\textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for\nphysics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge\ninto the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a\ndual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D\nstructures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible\nphysical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive\nexperiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization\ncapability of our framework.
