Abstract: This survey paper presents a comprehensive examination of Spiking Neural
Network (SNN) architecture search (SNNaS) from a unique hardware/software
co-design perspective. SNNs, inspired by biological neurons, have emerged as a
promising approach to neuromorphic computing. They offer significant advantages
in terms of power efficiency and real-time resource-constrained processing,
making them ideal for edge computing and IoT applications. However, designing
optimal SNN architectures poses significant challenges, due to their inherent
complexity (e.g., with respect to training) and the interplay between hardware
constraints and SNN models. We begin by providing an overview of SNNs,
emphasizing their operational principles and key distinctions from traditional
artificial neural networks (ANNs). We then provide a brief overview of the
state of the art in NAS for ANNs, highlighting the challenges of directly
applying these approaches to SNNs. We then survey the state-of-the-art in
SNN-specific NAS approaches. Finally, we conclude with insights into future
research directions for SNN research, emphasizing the potential of
hardware/software co-design in unlocking the full capabilities of SNNs. This
survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners
in the field, offering a holistic view of SNNaS and underscoring the importance
of a co-design approach to harness the true potential of neuromorphic
computing.

### [2] [MultiFoodhat: A potential new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13889)
*Yue Hu,Guohang Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MultiFoodChat框架，通过多智能体对话实现零样本食物识别，结合视觉语言模型和大语言模型进行协作推理，无需额外训练或标注即可识别未见过的食物类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督模型依赖大量标注数据且泛化能力有限，需要解决零样本食物识别问题以支持智能食品质量检测和饮食评估。

Method: 采用多智能体对话框架，包含对象感知令牌(OPT)提取细粒度视觉特征，交互式推理代理(IRA)动态解释上下文线索，通过多轮视觉-文本对话进行协作推理。

Result: 在多个公共食物数据集上的实验表明，该方法在识别准确率和可解释性方面优于现有的无监督和少样本方法。

Conclusion: MultiFoodChat为零样本食物识别提供了新范式，在智能食品质量检测和分析方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

*Andreas Leibetseder,Klaus Schoeffmann,Jörg Keckstein,Simon Keckstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个用于分割子宫内膜异位症暗色植入物的系统，能够分析腹腔镜手术视频并标注检测区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子宫内膜异位症具有多样化的视觉表现，识别困难且容易出错，需要为妇科医生提供辅助工具

Method: 训练系统识别暗色子宫内膜植入物，分析腹腔镜手术视频，用彩色叠加标注检测区域，并提供检测摘要

Result: 系统能够成功识别和分割子宫内膜异位症的暗色植入物区域

Conclusion: 该系统有助于改善视频浏览并为妇科医生治疗子宫内膜异位症提供辅助

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual
appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its
identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and
non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to
gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a
system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of
endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of
analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions
with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved
video browsing.

### [4] [Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993)
*Jia Yun Chua,Argyrios Zolotas,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探索将传统视觉模型（如YOLO）与视觉语言模型（如LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini）结合，以提升遥感图像分析能力，特别是在飞机检测和场景理解方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感数据量激增，但传统视觉模型需要大量领域特定标注数据且难以理解复杂环境上下文。视觉语言模型整合视觉和文本数据，但在遥感领域应用不足。

Method: 集成YOLO目标检测模型与多种视觉语言模型（LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini），在标注和未标注遥感数据以及图像退化场景中进行评估。

Result: 在飞机检测和计数准确性方面，所有模型平均MAE提升48.46%，在挑战性条件下表现尤其突出。CLIPScore提升6.17%，表明对遥感图像的综合理解能力增强。

Conclusion: 传统视觉模型与视觉语言模型的结合为更先进、高效的遥感图像分析开辟了新途径，特别是在少样本学习场景中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于AI的系统，用于检测前列腺癌中的筛状形态，该形态与不良预后相关。模型在内部和外部验证中表现优异，甚至超过了专家病理学家的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌中的筛状形态是一个重要的组织学特征，表明预后不良且不适合主动监测。然而，该特征在病理学家之间存在报告不足和观察者间变异性的问题。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-S编码器和多实例学习的深度学习模型，对640个前列腺核心针活检切片进行训练，并在内部和外部队列中进行验证。

Result: 模型在内部验证中表现优异（AUC: 0.97，Cohen's kappa: 0.81），在外部验证中表现稳健（AUC: 0.90，Cohen's kappa: 0.55）。在评估者间分析中，模型的表现超过了九位专家病理学家。

Conclusion: 该AI模型在前列腺癌筛状形态检测方面达到了病理学家水平，有望提高诊断可靠性、标准化报告并改善患者治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

### [6] [NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025)
*Junjie Nan,Jianing Li,Wei Chen,Mingkun Zhang,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NAPPure框架，通过似然最大化方法分离干净图像和扰动参数，有效应对非加性对抗扰动（如模糊、遮挡、失真等）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法主要针对加性扰动设计，对非加性扰动效果不佳，需要扩展框架来处理这类常见于现实世界的扰动。

Method: 建立对抗图像生成过程，通过似然最大化方法解耦潜在干净图像和扰动参数。

Result: 在GTSRB和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，NAPPure显著提升了图像分类模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NAPPure框架成功扩展了对抗净化的适用范围，能够有效处理非加性对抗扰动。

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

### [7] [Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032)
*Xiaoqian Shen,Wenxuan Zhang,Jun Chen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vgent是一个基于图的检索-推理增强生成框架，通过结构化图表示视频和中间推理步骤，提升大型视频语言模型对长视频的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临处理大量视频token和保留长期序列信息的挑战，传统检索增强生成方法在视频中会破坏时间依赖性和引入无关信息。

Method: 使用结构化图表示视频片段间的语义关系，引入中间推理步骤进行结构化验证，减少检索噪声并聚合跨片段的相关信息。

Result: 在三个长视频理解基准测试中，相比基础模型性能提升3.0%~5.4%，优于最先进的视频RAG方法8.6%。

Conclusion: Vgent通过图结构和中间推理有效解决了长视频理解中的检索和推理限制，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available
at https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Vgent.

### [8] [Synchronization of Multiple Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14051)
*Avihai Naaman,Ron Shapira Weber,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPL是一个基于原型的视频同步框架，通过构建共享的紧凑1D表示来对齐不同场景或生成AI视频，无需穷举成对匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步不同场景或生成AI视频具有挑战性，因为存在多样化的主题、背景和非线性时间错位。

Method: TPL从预训练模型提取的高维嵌入中构建共享的紧凑1D表示，通过学习统一原型序列来锚定关键动作阶段。

Result: 实验显示TPL在多个数据集上提高了同步准确性、效率和鲁棒性，特别是在细粒度帧检索和阶段分类任务中。

Conclusion: TPL是首个解决多个生成AI视频同步问题的方法，在多样化的视频同步任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从少量手机照片创建超真实、身份保持的3D头像的零样本方法，解决了现有方法在几何一致性和真实感方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临几何不一致、幻觉问题，以及合成数据训练无法捕捉高频细节的局限性，需要开发既能保持身份又能实现高真实感的3D头像生成方法。

Method: 引入两个关键贡献：生成式规范化模块处理多视图为标准化表示，以及基于transformer的模型在高质量高斯溅射头像数据集上训练，形成"捕获-规范化-溅射"流程。

Result: 该方法能够从非结构化照片生成具有高度真实感和稳健身份保持的静态半身头像。

Conclusion: 提出的零样本管道成功解决了现有3D头像生成方法在几何一致性和真实感方面的核心挑战。

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured
photos.

*Alexandr A. Kalinin,Anne E. Carpenter,Shantanu Singh,Matthew J. O'Meara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: cubic是一个开源的Python库，通过为SciPy和scikit-image API提供GPU加速替代方案，解决了生物图像分析工具在可扩展性、效率和与现代科学计算工作流集成方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代显微镜生成的大型2D和3D数据集使得现有计算方法在可扩展性、效率和与现代科学计算工作流集成方面受到限制。现有生物图像分析工具缺乏API、不支持GPU加速、3D图像处理能力有限，且与计算密集型工作流的互操作性差。

Method: cubic通过扩展广泛使用的SciPy和scikit-image API，提供来自CuPy和RAPIDS cuCIM的GPU加速替代方案。其API是设备无关的，当数据位于设备上时调度操作到GPU，否则在CPU上执行，无缝加速各种图像处理例程。

Result: 通过基准测试单个操作和复制现有的去卷积和分割流程，实现了显著的加速，同时保持了算法保真度。

Conclusion: cubic为可扩展、可重现的生物图像分析建立了坚实基础，与更广泛的Python科学计算生态系统集成，包括其他GPU加速方法，支持交互式探索和自动化高通量分析工作流。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

Conclusion: 该框架显著推进了视频生成在虚拟制作中的应用，支持多主体生成、场景定制和运动控制等核心功能。

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种联合建模Big Five和HEXACO人格特质的多模态识别方法，通过优化联合识别来提升人格特质识别的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注Big Five人格特质，但忽略了HEXACO模型中的诚实-谦逊特质，该特质与攻击性、社会支配倾向等相关。同时，机器学习建模中Big Five和HEXACO之间的关系尚未明确。

Method: 采用联合优化方法同时识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质，通过多模态人类行为数据进行建模。

Result: 在自我介绍视频数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够有效识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质。

Conclusion: 联合建模Big Five和HEXACO能够提升多模态人格特质识别的效果，为理解人格特质之间的关系提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于位平面噪声分析的AI生成图像检测方法，通过位平面引导的噪声图像生成和最大梯度补丁选择，实现了98.9%的平均准确率和毫秒级的检测速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像重建误差的AI生成图像检测方法计算成本高且无法有效捕捉原始图像中的固有噪声特征。

Method: 使用位平面图像处理提取误差特征，设计位平面引导的噪声图像生成和图像归一化策略，采用最大梯度补丁选择放大噪声信号，并提出轻量级分类头结构。

Result: 在GenImage基准测试中达到98.9%的平均准确率，相比现有方法提升11.9%，跨生成器泛化能力优秀，检测速度比现有方法快近百倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过位平面噪声分析有效解决了AI生成图像检测的计算效率和特征提取问题，具有高准确率和快速检测的优势。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PIA的多模态音频-视觉框架，通过整合语言、动态面部运动和面部识别线索来检测深度伪造视频，解决了传统检测方法对现代生成模型产生的细微时间差异检测不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法依赖手动设计的音素-视素对齐阈值、基本帧级一致性检查或单模态检测策略，无法有效识别由GAN、扩散模型和神经渲染技术等先进生成模型产生的现代深度伪造内容。这些先进技术能生成近乎完美的单帧图像，但会无意中产生传统检测器经常忽略的细微时间差异。

Method: 提出PIA（音素-时间和身份-动态分析）多模态框架，整合了音素序列、唇部几何数据和先进的面部身份嵌入。该方法通过识别多个互补模态之间的不一致性来检测细微的深度伪造篡改。

Result: 该集成方法显著提高了对细微深度伪造篡改的检测能力，能够识别跨多个互补模态的不一致性。

Conclusion: PIA框架通过多模态音频-视觉分析，有效解决了现代深度伪造检测的挑战，特别是在检测由先进生成模型产生的细微时间差异方面表现出色。

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

Motivation: 传统基于帧的OCC系统存在比特率低和处理负载高的问题，而现有的基于事件的OCC系统采用的调制方案未能充分利用事件视觉传感器的独特特性。

Method: 提出事件间隔调制(EIM)方案，通过调制事件之间的间隔来编码信息；调整和定制EVS参数以优化EIM的频率响应；实验确定EIM的最大调制阶数；基于获得的参数进行传输实验。

Result: 成功在室内环境中实现了28 kbps@10米和8.4 kbps@50米的传输速率，为基于事件的OCC系统设定了新的比特率基准。

Conclusion: EIM方案能够充分利用事件视觉传感器的异步操作特性，显著提高了基于事件的OCC系统的传输性能，为高速、低延迟的可见光通信提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模场景中定位和渲染的计算成本高、单个网络容量有限的问题。

Method: 使用门控网络隐式分类选择子网络，每次推理只激活一个子网络；提出无辅助损失的负载均衡策略。

Result: 在剑桥测试集上仅需10分钟训练即可获得高质量渲染结果，显著降低成本同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: MACE为大规模场景应用提供了高效解决方案，在定位精度和渲染质量方面表现优异。

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成模型在人脸身份一致性保持方面存在困难，特别是当人脸在图像中占比较小且人物表情和动作变化较大时

Method: 基于强化学习的身份保持奖励引导优化框架，使用人脸身份评分器优化扩散模型，通过反向传播奖励信号和KL散度正则化稳定训练

Result: 在Wan 2.2 I2V模型和内部I2V模型上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: IPRO方法能够有效提升图像到视频生成中的人脸身份一致性，无需引入额外模块或改变模型架构

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 该方法为将强化学习与个性化视频生成对齐提供了可行的见解，显著改善了多人身份保持的视频生成质量。

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率图像的跨视图匹配面临二次复杂度和缺乏显式匹配约束的挑战，现有交叉注意力机制难以有效处理。

Method: 提出MatchAttention机制动态匹配相对位置，使用BilinearSoftmax实现连续可微的滑动窗口注意力采样，设计MatchDecoder作为核心组件，并引入门控交叉MatchAttention和一致性约束损失处理遮挡问题。

Result: MatchStereo-B在Middlebury基准测试中排名第一，KITTI分辨率推理仅需29ms；MatchStereo-T可在0.1秒内处理4K UHD图像，仅使用3GB GPU内存；在KITTI 2012、KITTI 2015、ETH3D和Spring flow数据集上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高精度、低计算复杂度的实时高分辨率跨视图匹配，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯泼溅方法在大规模数据集上表现良好，但在稀疏覆盖区域难以捕捉细节或保持真实感，主要受限于稀疏3D训练数据的固有局限性。

Method: 整合2D计算机视觉技术，包括凸滤波和来自DINO等基础模型的语义特征监督，利用2D分割先验和高维特征嵌入来指导高斯泼溅的密集化和细化。

Result: 在三个数据集上的验证表明，GauSSmart在大多数评估场景中持续优于现有高斯泼溅方法。

Conclusion: 混合2D-3D方法具有显著潜力，2D基础模型与3D重建管道的深思熟虑结合可以克服各自方法的固有局限性。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

Method: 基于因果推理的框架，利用前门原则设计转换策略，明确结合中介变量和观察到的组织切片，减轻混杂因素的影响

Result: 在CAMELYON17数据集和私有组织病理学数据集上验证，在未见领域上实现一致性能提升，相比现有基线方法提升高达7%

Conclusion: 因果推理是解决组织病理学图像分析中领域偏移问题的有力工具

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing
statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this
work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages
semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method
implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that
explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our
method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset,
demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and
the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These
results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for
addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现良好，但仍容易产生幻觉，过度依赖单一模态或记忆训练数据而缺乏视觉基础。

Method: 训练免费的三层对比解码加水印方法：1) 选择解码层中的成熟层和业余层；2) 使用水印相关问题识别关键层以评估视觉基础程度；3) 应用三层对比解码生成最终输出。

Result: 在POPE、MME和AMBER等公开基准测试中，该方法在减少LVLMs幻觉方面达到了最先进的性能，并生成更具视觉基础的响应。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，提高输出的视觉基础性，无需额外训练即可实现性能提升。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

Motivation: 虹膜生物识别系统容易受到呈现攻击，但缺乏足够的训练数据来开发有效的检测方法。

Method: 使用多领域图像转换扩散StyleGAN，结合扩散模型和GAN的优势，通过自适应损失函数生成逼真的合成眼部图像。

Result: 在LivDet2020数据集上，1%误检率下的真检率从93.41%提升至98.72%。

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN能有效生成高质量合成数据，显著提升呈现攻击检测性能，为生物识别数据稀缺问题提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

Conclusion: VaCo通过视觉中心激活和协调机制，有效统一了多模态大语言模型中文本和视觉输出的优化，显著增强了模型的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence
constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally,
we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with
transformation synchronization, blending historical and multi-view data. Our
approach surpasses previous self- supervised registration methods on ScanNet

TL;DR: SPR（空间偏好奖励）方法通过奖励多模态大语言模型生成详细且定位准确的区域描述，来增强其细粒度空间理解能力，无需大量训练开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在细粒度空间感知能力上存在不足，如生成详细区域描述或准确定位对象时表现不佳。这主要是因为现有方法主要关注对预标注指令数据的建模，而缺乏对模型实际响应的直接监督。

Method: SPR方法通过随机选择图像区域和模型生成的区域描述，引入语义和定位评分来全面评估文本质量和定位质量。将定位精度最高的优化描述与最低分的初始描述配对，进行直接偏好优化，从而增强与视觉输入的细粒度对齐。

Result: 在标准引用和定位基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SPR能够有效提升多模态大语言模型的空间理解能力，且训练开销极小。

Conclusion: SPR方法通过空间偏好奖励机制，成功增强了多模态大语言模型的细粒度空间感知能力，在最小化训练成本的同时显著提升了空间理解性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

*Danish Ali,Ajmal Mian,Naveed Akhtar,Ghulam Mubashar Hassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DRBD-Mamba模型，一种高效的3D脑肿瘤分割方法，通过双分辨率双向Mamba架构捕获多尺度长程依赖，显著降低计算开销，并在BraTS2023数据集上实现性能提升和15倍效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba模型在脑肿瘤分割中存在显著计算开销，且在不同数据分区下的鲁棒性评估不足，需要更高效和可靠的解决方案。

Method: 使用空间填充曲线进行3D到1D特征映射，提出门控融合模块自适应整合正向和反向上下文，引入量化块离散化特征以提高鲁棒性，并建立五个系统性折叠进行严格评估。

Result: 在BraTS2023测试集上，全肿瘤、肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤的Dice系数分别提升0.10%、1.75%和0.93%；在系统性五折评估中，肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤平均Dice增益分别为0.86%和1.45%，同时实现15倍效率提升。

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba模型在保持高分割精度的同时显著提升计算效率，展现出优于现有方法的鲁棒性和计算优势。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

Motivation: 现有PCB检测研究主要关注裸板或线路级缺陷，而主板组装级检测研究不足，需要开发可靠的检测框架来确保高产量电子制造的质量。

Method: 使用YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN两种检测器进行基准测试，提出轻量级集成方法CTV Voter来平衡精度和召回率，并在真实扰动条件下评估鲁棒性。

Result: YOLOv7在精度上表现优异但召回率不足，Faster R-CNN则相反；CTV Voter集成方法有效平衡了精度和召回率；在扰动条件下检测器面临稳定性挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了计算机视觉技术从基准结果向实际主板组装制造质量保证的过渡，提供了可部署的检测工具和系统性的评估框架。

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学面临全切片图像计算量大和密集标注稀缺的瓶颈，现有方法常忽略多放大倍率的细粒度信息和肿瘤微环境变化。

Method: 采用从易到难的渐进表示学习策略，结合双课程对比多实例学习，直接处理千兆像素级全切片图像进行预后预测。

Result: 在12种癌症类型（5,954名患者，1254万图像块）上验证，DCMIL优于标准预后模型，能识别细粒度预后相关区域并提供不确定性估计。

Conclusion: DCMIL无需密集标注即可有效处理全切片图像，识别预后关键区域，捕捉正常与肿瘤组织形态差异，具有生成新生物学见解的潜力。

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一帧内和帧间编码的神经视频压缩框架，通过自适应帧内/帧间编码和双向帧间压缩设计，显著提升了压缩效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经视频压缩方案在处理遮挡、新内容、帧间误差传播等方面存在不足，需要借鉴传统视频编码中的帧内编码思想来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用统一帧内和帧间编码框架，每个帧由单一模型处理，自适应执行帧内/帧间编码；提出同时双帧压缩设计，利用前向和后向帧间冗余。

Result: 相比DCVC-RT平均降低10.7% BD-rate，提供更稳定的比特率和每帧质量，保持实时编码/解码性能。

Conclusion: 该方案有效解决了现有NVC方案的局限性，在压缩效率、稳定性和实时性方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

Motivation: 基于深度学习的视频目标检测在安全关键应用中至关重要，但这些检测器容易受到对抗攻击，特别是通用扰动攻击的影响。

Method: 使用核范数正则化促进背景集中的结构化扰动，并采用自适应乐观指数梯度方法进行高效优化。

Result: 所提出的攻击方法在有效性上优于低秩投影梯度下降和Frank-Wolfe攻击，同时保持高隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频目标检测提供了一种高效且隐蔽的通用对抗攻击方案，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务图像恢复模型参数过多导致计算效率低下，需要压缩模型同时保持性能

Method: 使用迭代剪枝策略，通过多轮移除低幅值权重并重置剩余权重到原始初始化，发现高性能稀疏子网络

Result: 在去雨、去雾、去噪任务上，仅保留10%可训练参数仍能维持高图像恢复性能

Conclusion: MIR-L方法有效压缩多任务图像恢复模型，在极高稀疏度下保持或超越现有技术性能

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放牧活动对农业生产和生物多样性都有重要影响，但目前缺乏可扩展的放牧监测方法。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2 L2A时间序列数据，使用CNN-LSTM集成模型对多边形定义的农田边界进行二元预测（放牧/未放牧）。

Result: 在五个验证分割上平均F1分数达到77%，对放牧草地的召回率达到90%。在仅检查4%场地的情况下，优先检查模型预测为未放牧的场地，确认的未放牧场地数量比随机检查多17.2倍。

Conclusion: 粗分辨率、免费可用的卫星数据能够可靠地指导检查资源，用于保护导向的土地利用合规监测。

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

Motivation: Vision Mamba相比Vision Transformers(ViTs)具有线性扩展的网络规模，相比传统CNN需要更少的可训练参数，这些特性使其在计算和内存效率方面具有优势。

Method: 使用Vision Mamba作为骨干网络构建神经网络，用于预测三维多孔介质的渗透率，并与ViT和CNN模型进行性能比较，同时进行消融研究评估各组件对准确性的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有潜力集成到大型视觉模型中，用Vision Mamba替代ViT，源代码已公开以促进可重复性研究。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

Abstract: Defective surgical instruments pose serious risks to sterility, mechanical
integrity, and patient safety, increasing the likelihood of surgical
complications. However, quality control in surgical instrument manufacturing
often relies on manual inspection, which is prone to human error and
inconsistency. This study introduces SurgScan, an AI-powered defect detection
framework for surgical instruments. Using YOLOv8, SurgScan classifies defects

state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest
accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,

Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中训练-推理不匹配问题：训练时噪声来自提示特定子空间，而推理时来自提示无关的高斯先验，导致部分生成图像与提示对齐不佳。

Method: 设计噪声投影器，基于提示嵌入将初始噪声映射到提示感知的对应噪声；通过VLM获取反馈，蒸馏到奖励模型，使用准直接偏好优化优化投影器。

Conclusion: 提出的噪声投影框架有效解决了训练-推理不匹配问题，无需参考图像或手工先验，且推理成本低，显著提升文本-图像对齐性能。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in

*Keima Abe,Hayato Muraki,Shuhei Tomoshige,Kenichi Oishi,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PL-SE-ADA是一个用于脑部MR图像领域协调和可解释表示学习的框架，通过解耦域不变和域特定特征，在保持疾病相关信息的同时提供高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像（如MR扫描）存在领域偏移问题，影响机器学习性能。现有方法虽然有效但缺乏可解释性，这在医疗应用中至关重要。

Method: 使用两个编码器分别提取域不变特征和域特定特征，通过对抗训练和图像重建（将两个特征的重构相加）来确保协调性和信息保留。

Result: 在图像重建、疾病分类和领域识别任务中达到或优于现有方法性能，并能可视化域独立和域特定脑部特征。

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA不仅实现了有效的领域协调，还提供了高可解释性，解决了医疗应用中缺乏解释性的关键问题。

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Method: 通过重建驱动的预训练方案，将图像显式分解为解耦的经典描述符，将每个描述符视为独立但互补的视觉知识组件。

Conclusion: 通过显式分解视觉属性，该方法为视觉理解提供了一种新的有效学习途径，超越了传统的分类和分割任务。

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调(PEFT)方法只能进行一步调整，对于特征高度纠缠的复杂数据集效果不足，需要多步调整能力来实现更精确的跨模态对齐。

Method: 提出FMA方法：1) 使用固定耦合策略确保类别对应；2) 噪声增强策略缓解数据稀缺问题；3) 早停求解器提高效率和精度。通过学习跨模态速度场实现多步调整。

Result: FMA在各种基准测试和骨干网络上都能带来显著的性能提升，特别是在具有挑战性的数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: FMA作为首个模型无关的多步调整方法，通过多步校正能力实现了更精确和鲁棒的跨模态对齐，显著优于现有的一步PEFT方法。

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为场景去上下文化(SDeC)的训练自由方法，通过抑制文本到图像生成中主体与场景的自然相关性来解决身份偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中的身份偏移问题，特别是当目标场景未知时，传统方法依赖预先知道所有场景的假设不切实际。

Method: 通过SVD方向稳定性量化识别并抑制ID提示嵌入中的潜在场景-ID相关性，自适应地重新加权相应特征值，实现场景去上下文化。

Result: 实验表明SDeC显著增强了身份保持能力，同时保持了场景多样性。

Conclusion: SDeC提供了一种高效、灵活且通用的解决方案，适用于现实世界应用中目标场景未知或随时间变化的情况。

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS训练存在三个关键低效问题：高斯密度分配偏斜、计算负载不均衡和内存访问碎片化，这些问题限制了训练效率。

Method: 1) 算法层面：启发式工作负载敏感高斯密度控制；2) 系统层面：基于相似性的高斯采样和合并；3) 映射层面：基于重排序的内存访问映射策略。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100 GPU上相比3DGS实现了1.44倍训练加速，质量损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: BalanceGS通过算法-系统协同设计有效解决了3DGS训练中的效率瓶颈，显著提升了训练速度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer
geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the
re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline
in our study. The results confirms the effectiveness of incorporating curvature
information into deep learning architectures and highlight the benefit of
multi-branch feature learning for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle
re-identification.

Conclusion: 该双向框架为关键点引导的图像理解和语言引导的精确定位应用奠定了基础，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.
Our code and dataset are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成在保持对象运动连贯性和交互方面存在困难，主要瓶颈包括：人类提供的运动提示在编码后有效token过少，以及单头优化倾向于纹理而非时间一致性。

Method: 提出两个组件：1) 实例线索 - 将稀疏的用户可编辑提示转换为密集的2.5D运动场；2) 密集RoPE - 在token空间中保持线索显著性，结合RGB+辅助图预测来稳定优化。

Result: 该方法减少了深度模糊性，提高了时间一致性，无需逐帧轨迹脚本。

Conclusion: STANCE框架有效解决了视频生成中的运动连贯性问题，通过实例线索和密集RoPE实现了更好的对象运动控制。

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Conclusion: Wiki-PRF方法通过三阶段处理和强化学习训练，有效解决了KB-VQA任务中的多模态查询质量和检索结果相关性挑战，显著提升了视觉问答系统的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的Shot2Tactic-Caption框架成功实现了羽毛球视频的语义和时间多尺度字幕生成，能够描述成功执行的战术以及被中断后恢复的战术执行过程。

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

TL;DR: EVS通过识别和修剪时间上静态的视觉补丁来减少视频中的令牌冗余，无需架构更改或重新训练，显著降低令牌数量同时保持语义保真度，实现更快的推理和更长的输入序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型从静态图像理解扩展到视频推理时，由于处理密集帧序列的二次成本，其可扩展性受到根本限制。长视频经常超过现代语言模型的令牌预算，导致严重的上下文限制和延迟问题。

Method: 引入高效视频采样(EVS)，一种简单即插即用的方法，通过识别和修剪时间上静态的补丁（在连续帧间保持不变的时空区域）来减少视频中的令牌冗余。EVS保持位置身份，无需架构更改或重新训练。

Result: EVS显著减少令牌数量同时保持语义保真度，使大型语言模型的首次令牌时间(TTFT)减少高达4倍，且精度损失最小。结合使用随机修剪率的再训练阶段，EVS产生对不同程度压缩具有鲁棒性的模型，并在激进修剪下保持完整性能。

Conclusion: EVS持续改进效率-精度权衡，在不牺牲质量的情况下实现可扩展的视频语言理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepTok是一个生成建模框架，使用自监督视觉变换器获得的单个连续潜在token来表示图像，通过微调语义token嵌入和生成解码器实现高效图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2D潜在空间的空间冗余问题，降低训练成本，同时保持自监督学习表示的良好几何特性。

Method: 基于预训练的SSL编码器，仅微调语义token嵌入，配合使用流匹配目标的生成解码器，添加余弦相似度损失来正则化适应后的token。

Result: 在类条件ImageNet生成上取得竞争性结果，在MS-COCO上以极有限的训练预算达到竞争性的零样本文本到图像合成性能。

Conclusion: 微调后的SSL表示可以作为紧凑有效的潜在空间，用于高效的生成建模。

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteeringTTA是一个基于Feynman-Kac引导的测试时适应框架，通过扩散模型进行输入适应，无需模型更新或源数据，在ImageNet-C上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于梯度的扩散TTA方法在探索性和跨失真类型泛化方面的局限性，提出无需梯度引导的推理框架。

Method: 采用Feynman-Kac引导机制，通过伪标签驱动的奖励函数，维护多个粒子轨迹，结合累积top-K概率和熵调度来平衡探索和置信度。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上，SteeringTTA始终优于基线方法，且不需要任何模型更新或源数据。

Conclusion: SteeringTTA通过引导扩散输入适应，有效提升了在分布偏移下的分类鲁棒性，为测试时适应提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本预训练策略，利用非配对视频片段进行上下文学习，实现基于指令的视频编辑，显著减少了大规模配对数据集的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于指令的图像编辑进展迅速，但扩展到视频领域面临挑战，主要因为构建大规模配对视频编辑数据集的成本和复杂性过高。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先在约100万个真实视频片段上预训练基础视频生成模型，学习基本编辑概念；然后在少于15万个精选编辑对上微调，扩展更多编辑任务并提升编辑质量。

Result: 实验表明该方法在指令对齐和视觉保真度方面均优于现有基于指令的视频编辑方法，编辑指令遵循度提升12%，编辑质量提升15%。

Conclusion: 该低成本预训练策略有效解决了视频编辑数据集构建难题，赋予基础视频生成模型通用编辑能力，为基于指令的视频编辑提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

TL;DR: 将去相关反向传播(DBP)集成到MAE预训练中，通过减少输入相关性来加速收敛，在保持性能的同时显著降低训练时间和碳排放


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAE预训练虽然性能优秀但计算成本高昂，在工业应用中不实用，需要找到加速训练的方法

Method: 在MAE预训练的编码器中选择性应用DBP优化方法，迭代减少各层输入相关性

Result: DBP-MAE将达到基线性能的挂钟时间减少21.1%，碳排放降低21.4%，分割mIoU提高1.1个百分点

Conclusion: DBP可以有效减少大规模ViT预训练的时间和能耗，同时提升下游任务性能，在工业场景中具有实用价值

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

TL;DR: EuroMineNet是首个基于Sentinel-2多光谱影像的欧洲采矿足迹制图与监测多时间基准数据集，涵盖2015-2024年133个欧盟采矿点的年度观测和专家验证标注，支持采矿足迹制图和跨时间变化检测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 采矿活动是环境退化的主要来源，但现有数据集在时间深度或地理范围上有限，需要长期一致的采矿诱发地表变化监测来支持可持续资源管理和环境治理。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2多光谱影像构建EuroMineNet数据集，提供2015-2024年133个欧盟采矿点的年度观测和专家验证标注，支持两个任务：多时间采矿足迹制图（使用新的变化感知时间IoU指标评估）和跨时间变化检测。

Result: 对20个最先进深度学习模型的基准测试显示，GeoAI方法能有效识别长期环境变化，但在检测短期动态方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: EuroMineNet通过推进时间一致和可解释的采矿监测，为可持续土地利用管理、环境韧性以及应用GeoAI实现社会和环境福祉的更广泛目标做出贡献。

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

TL;DR: WeCKD提出了一种弱监督链式知识蒸馏网络，通过构建渐进式蒸馏链来解决传统知识蒸馏中的知识退化、监督效率低和数据依赖性强等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法存在知识退化、监督效率低、依赖强教师模型或大数据集的问题，限制了在真实世界有限数据场景下的有效性。

Method: 构建渐进式蒸馏链，每个模型不仅从前驱模型学习，还精炼知识后传递给后续模型，每个模型仅使用部分数据集进行训练。

Result: 在四个耳镜成像数据集上的评估显示，该方法不仅匹配甚至超越现有监督方法的性能，在有限数据下相比单骨干网络累积准确率提升达+23%。

Conclusion: WeCKD通过链式知识蒸馏有效减少了数据依赖，提升了特征学习能力，在多种医学成像模态中展现出良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Motivation: 传统鲸鱼种群监测方法昂贵且难以扩展，而现有自动检测方法面临标注数据缺乏、图像质量变化、环境条件多样等挑战

Method: 使用统计异常检测方法标记空间异常点（"有趣点"），配合网络标注界面让专家快速标注这些点

Result: 在三个已知鲸鱼标注的基准场景中，召回率达到90.3%至96.4%，同时将需要专家检查的区域面积减少了99.8%——从超过1000平方公里减少到不足2平方公里

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖标注训练数据，为未来基于卫星的机器辅助海洋哺乳动物监测提供了可扩展的第一步

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open
sourced this pipeline at https://github.com/microsoft/whales.

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法缺乏学习先验，限制了率失真权衡的进一步提升，需要利用学习图像先验来恢复压缩引起的质量退化。

Method: 在初始压缩高斯基础上，构建恢复网络建模图像空间中的压缩伪影，引入粗渲染残差作为边信息，通过恢复图像监督优化压缩高斯。

Conclusion: 该框架兼容现有高斯压缩方法，能够产生高度紧凑的表示并增强渲染性能，为3DGS压缩提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

Motivation: 火星地形数据存在大量缺失值，现有插值方法难以保持几何一致性，需要更先进的重建技术来支持太空探索中的虚拟现实应用。

Method: 使用无条件扩散模型，在12000个火星高度图增强数据集上进行训练，采用非均匀缩放策略捕捉多尺度地形特征，最终固定为128x128分辨率。

Conclusion: 无条件扩散模型能够有效重建火星表面地形，为太空探索中的虚拟现实应用提供更可靠的地形数据。

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

*Dingzhou Xie,Rushi Lan,Cheng Pang,Enhao Ning,Jiahao Zeng,Wei Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出跨层特征自注意力模块(CFSAM)，通过建模多尺度特征间的局部和全局依赖关系，显著提升目标检测性能，在PASCAL VOC和COCO数据集上分别达到78.6%和52.1%的mAP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注意力机制大多局限于单层或双层特征优化，忽略了多尺度表征间的丰富层间依赖关系，限制了检测尺度变化较大目标的能力。

Method: CFSAM包含三个组件：卷积局部特征提取器、基于Transformer的全局建模单元（高效捕获跨层交互）、特征融合机制（恢复和增强原始表征）。

Result: 集成到SSD300框架后，在PASCAL VOC上mAP从75.5%提升至78.6%，在COCO上从43.1%提升至52.1%，优于现有注意力模块，且加速训练收敛而不增加显著计算开销。

Conclusion: 显式跨层注意力建模对推进多尺度目标检测具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

TL;DR: R-Super是一种利用医学报告训练AI进行肿瘤分割的方法，大幅减少了对人工绘制肿瘤掩模的需求，在多种肿瘤类型上实现了与基于掩模训练相当甚至更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期肿瘤检测能挽救生命，但训练AI模型需要大量人工绘制的肿瘤掩模，成本高昂且耗时。相比之下，临床实践中几乎每个CT扫描都配有描述肿瘤特征的医学报告，这些丰富信息在AI训练中未被充分利用。

Method: R-Super通过训练AI模型来分割与医学报告中描述相匹配的肿瘤，利用大量现成的医学报告进行AI训练，显著减少了对人工绘制肿瘤掩模的依赖。

Result: 使用101,654份报告训练的AI模型达到了与使用723个掩模训练相当的性能。结合报告和掩模训练使敏感性提高+13%，特异性提高+8%，在7种肿瘤类型中有5种的检测表现超过了放射科医生。

Conclusion: 这项研究挑战了大规模人工绘制肿瘤掩模不可或缺的传统观念，为多种肿瘤类型的早期检测建立了可扩展且易于实现的路径。

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分层图像分类方法通常假设完整细粒度标注，但真实世界中的监督标注粒度各异，受图像质量、标注者专业知识和任务需求影响。

Method: 使用CLIP模拟语义模糊性，创建混合粒度标签；提出free-grain学习框架，结合视觉语言模型生成的伪属性和半监督学习来增强语义和视觉引导。

Result: 所提出的方法在混合监督下显著提升了分层分类性能，基准测试和方法共同推进了现实约束下的分层分类研究。

Conclusion: ImageNet-F基准和free-grain学习方法有效解决了真实世界中混合粒度标注的挑战，为分层图像分类在现实约束下的应用提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在多种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其在面部识别方面的潜力尚未得到充分探索，特别是开源MLLMs需要在标准基准上与现有面部识别模型进行对比评估。

Method: 在多个面部识别数据集（LFW、CALFW、CPLFW、CFP、AgeDB和RFW）上对最先进的MLLMs进行系统性基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，MLLMs能够捕捉到对面部相关任务有用的丰富语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中表现不如专门的面部识别模型。

Conclusion: 该基准为推进基于MLLM的面部识别提供了基础，为设计具有更高准确性和泛化能力的下一代模型提供了见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

Motivation: 由于密集视频目标字幕任务的复杂性和手动标注的高成本，现有方法采用分离训练策略导致性能不佳，需要开发端到端的解决方案。

Method: 利用最先进的视觉语言模型生成关于时空定位实体的合成字幕，扩展LVIS和LV-VIS数据集为LVISCap和LV-VISCap，训练MaskCaptioner模型进行联合检测、分割、跟踪和字幕生成。

Result: 在LVISCap和LV-VISCap上进行预训练后，MaskCaptioner在VidSTG、VLN和BenSMOT三个现有基准测试中实现了最先进的DVOC结果。

Conclusion: 通过合成字幕扩展数据集的方法有效解决了DVOC任务的数据稀缺问题，MaskCaptioner模型展示了端到端联合训练的优越性能。

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低光条件下难以提取可靠特征表示，导致纹理恢复差、颜色不一致和伪影问题，需要更鲁棒的特征学习机制。

Method: LightQANet包含两个核心模块：光照量化模块(LQM)显式提取和量化光照相关因子，光照感知提示模块(LAPM)将光照先验编码为可学习提示来动态指导特征学习。

Result: 在多个低光数据集上的实验表明，该方法在各种挑战性光照场景下都取得了最先进的定性和定量结果。

Conclusion: LightQANet通过量化自适应特征学习实现了跨不同光照条件的一致鲁棒图像质量提升，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在处理复杂运动时存在困难，生成的运动往往不够自然、平滑且上下文不一致，这限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出RealDPO对齐范式，使用真实世界视频作为正样本进行偏好学习，通过对比真实视频与错误模型输出实现迭代自校正，并构建RealAction-5K高质量视频数据集支持训练。

Conclusion: RealDPO通过真实世界数据驱动的偏好学习有效提升了复杂运动合成的质量，为视频生成模型的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C4D是一个从单目视频恢复4D动态场景的框架，通过引入短期光流和长期点跟踪两种对应关系，将现有的3D重建方法扩展到4D动态场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点图式3D重建方法（如DUSt3R）在静态场景中表现良好，但直接应用于动态场景会导致不准确结果，因为运动物体违反了多视角几何约束。

Method: C4D通过训练动态感知点跟踪器捕获短期光流和长期点跟踪对应关系，利用运动掩码分离运动元素和静态背景，并引入动态场景优化目标来恢复每帧3D几何和相机参数。

Result: 实验表明该框架实现了完整的4D恢复，在深度估计、相机姿态估计和点跟踪等多个下游任务中表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: C4D通过时间对应关系成功将3D重建扩展到4D动态场景，为动态场景理解提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了复制粘贴问题，在保持高身份相似性的同时实现了表达性可控生成，为身份一致生成提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放词汇目标检测方法过度依赖直接的图像-文本匹配，忽略了理解语义复杂场景所需的中间推理步骤，导致在拥挤或遮挡场景中鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出CoT-PL框架，将目标理解分解为三个可解释步骤：区域感知、零样本类别识别和背景定位，并引入对比背景学习来促进目标与背景的特征解耦。

Result: 在拥挤和遮挡场景中，新类别伪标签质量分别比之前最佳方法提升了103.4%和168.4%；在开放词汇COCO上AP50提升7.7，在LVIS上新类别mask AP提升2.9，达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: CoT-PL通过结构化视觉链式思维推理和对比背景学习，显著提升了开放词汇目标检测在复杂场景中的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

TL;DR: 提出一种推理时扩散采样方法，通过隐式3D正则化实现多视角一致的图像编辑，避免显式3D表示的优化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D图像编辑模型在多视角图像编辑时缺乏跨视角一致性，而基于显式3D表示的方法存在优化过程冗长、稀疏视角下不稳定的问题。

Method: 采用耦合扩散采样技术，同时从多视角图像分布和2D编辑图像分布中采样两个轨迹，通过耦合项强制生成图像的多视角一致性。

Result: 在三个不同的多视角图像编辑任务上验证了方法的有效性和通用性，适用于各种模型架构。

Conclusion: 该方法作为多视角一致编辑的通用解决方案具有潜力，无需显式3D表示即可实现稳定的多视角一致性。

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

TL;DR: PRTraj是一个新的轨迹表示学习框架，通过环境感知和显式路径选择建模来改进轨迹表示，在多种下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹表示学习方法将轨迹视为孤立的时空序列，忽略了外部环境和内部路径选择行为对轨迹形成的影响。

Method: 提出PRTraj框架，包含环境感知模块（从POI分布捕获多粒度环境语义）和路径选择编码器（将路段转换建模为决策序列），最终聚合形成全局轨迹嵌入。

Result: 在3个真实数据集和5个下游任务上的广泛实验验证了PRTraj的有效性和泛化能力，且在少样本场景下仍保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: PRTraj通过统一环境感知和路径选择建模，显著提升了轨迹表示学习的性能，具有很好的数据效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的分数位量化方法SHORT，通过渐进式降低模型精度并利用分数位优化来保持生成质量，在多种扩散模型上实现了优于标准QAT的质量，并成功在智能手机上部署运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大模型在智能手机上部署时面临的内存和计算限制问题，同时保持生成质量。现有量化方法虽然能提高效率，但在激进量化下难以保持模型质量。

Method: 提出分数位量化方法SHORT，渐进式地将模型精度从32位降低到4位，在优化过程中利用分数位来维持高质量的生成能力。

Result: 在SD3.5-Medium、Sana、PixArt和FLUX.1-schnell等多种扩散模型上实现了改进的质量，比标准QAT的FiD降低了4-7%。成功在三星S25U手机上部署运行Sana模型。

Conclusion: SHORT方法有效解决了大模型在资源受限设备上的部署问题，在保持生成质量的同时实现了高效运行。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

TL;DR: 该研究创建了AbdomenAtlas 2.0数据集，包含10,135个CT扫描和15,130个肿瘤实例，在六个器官中进行体素级标注，相比现有公开数据集实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI肿瘤分割受限于缺乏大规模体素级标注数据集，这些数据集难以创建且需要医学专家参与。研究发现合成数据可以提升数据缩放效率。

Method: 基于JHH数据集的教训，创建了AbdomenAtlas 2.0数据集，包含10,135个CT扫描，由23名放射科专家在六个器官中进行体素级手动标注。

Result: 在分布内测试中DSC提升7%，在分布外测试中DSC提升16%，显著优于现有公开数据集。

Conclusion: AbdomenAtlas 2.0为训练AI分割六个器官中的肿瘤提供了强大基础，证明了大规模标注数据集和合成数据在提升AI性能方面的重要性。

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Result: 在仿真基准和真实世界任务中表现出强大的空间推理能力和有竞争力的操作性能

Conclusion: QDepth-VLA通过深度预测任务有效增强了VLA模型的空间感知和推理能力

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在现实场景表现良好，但在想象力场景中性能显著下降，因为这些提示涉及罕见共现概念和长距离语义关系，超出了训练分布范围。

Method: 提出ImagerySearch方法，这是一种基于提示的自适应测试时搜索策略，根据提示中的语义关系动态调整推理搜索空间和奖励函数。

Result: 在LDT-Bench基准上，ImagerySearch始终优于强大的视频生成基线和现有测试时缩放方法，并在VBench上实现了有竞争力的改进。

Conclusion: ImagerySearch方法能够有效提升视频生成模型在想象力场景中的表现，LDT-Bench基准的发布将促进未来想象力视频生成的研究。

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型对皮肤病变分析缺乏可解释性，无法解释ABCDE分类法中的人类可理解特征。需要开发既能分类又能量化临床相关特征的框架。

Method: 开发深度学习框架，分类皮肤病变并量化ABCD特征分数，模拟E特征的演变过程，在潜在空间中可视化特征轨迹。使用HAM10000数据集进行实验。

Result: 分类准确率约89%，黑色素瘤AUC为0.96。特征评估在预测不对称性、颜色变化和直径方面表现良好，但边界不规则性建模仍较困难。

Conclusion: 该框架使医生能够将机器学习诊断与临床相关标准联系起来，从而增进对皮肤癌进展的理解，为未来探索开辟更多窗口。

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合多种视觉模态的方法，使用预训练专家模型和程序化组合，通过全自动数据流水线处理原始视频，无需人工监督。采用PHG-MAE模型有效利用多模态数据，并将模型高效蒸馏至小于1M参数，性能可与300M参数模型竞争。


<details>

Motivation: 现实世界本质上是多模态的，但传统机器学习模型多为单模态，近期趋势转向双模态（如图像和文本）。为了真正理解世界，需要整合所有独立模态。

Method: 使用预训练专家模型和程序化组合，通过全自动数据流水线处理原始视频，采用PHG-MAE模型处理多模态数据，并进行模型蒸馏。

Result: 蒸馏后的小型模型（<1M参数）在性能上可与约300M参数的大型模型竞争，并在手持设备或网络摄像头上实现实时语义分割。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了通过多模态集成和模型蒸馏，可以在保持竞争力的同时显著减少模型参数，实现实时应用部署。

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

Motivation: 现有手-物体交互生成研究局限于固定抓握模式，控制依赖于物理先验，无法捕捉日常交互的多样性。需要支持细粒度意图控制的自由交互生成。

Method: 构建WildO2数据集（4.4k个独特交互，92种意图，610个物体类别），提出TOUCH框架：基于多级扩散模型，通过显式接触建模进行条件控制，并利用接触一致性和物理约束进行细化。

Result: 能够生成可控、多样且物理合理的手-物体交互，代表日常活动中的各种交互模式。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了手-物体交互从抓握到自由交互的生成能力，通过细粒度语义控制实现了超越抓握先验的多样化手部姿势生成。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

Result: 在DAD、DADA-2000、DoTA和Nexar数据集上，BADAS实现了最先进的AP/AUC性能，优于前向碰撞ADAS基线，并提供更真实的事故时间估计。

Conclusion: BADAS模型有效解决了ego-centric碰撞预测问题，发布了模型权重、代码和重新标注的数据集以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family
of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision
dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation.
We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus
alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC
and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and
comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and
BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and
Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a

estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with
re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver是视觉自回归范式中实用且有效的可控文本到图像生成解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注纯语言任务或5选项以内的MCQ，无法应对细粒度视觉分类中数百到数千个高度相关选项的情况，且难以扩展到检索问题

Method: 两阶段方法：先让MLLM回答开放式问题，然后使用仅文本约束解码预测最可能选项；在检索设置中使用早停方法计算约束响应的概率

Result: 在七个细粒度视觉数据集上的分类和检索评估均显示性能提升，且在不同自然语言任务实现方式下保持稳定

Conclusion: nlg2choice方法有效解决了MLLM在细粒度视觉分类中处理多选项MCQ和检索任务的评估难题

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

Motivation: 现有半监督视频异常检测方法在处理复杂对象交互异常时表现不佳，且缺乏可解释性

Method: 使用MLLM分析不同时刻的对象对，生成活动和交互的文本描述，在测试时与正常训练视频的文本描述进行比较

Result: 在基准数据集上有效检测基于交互的复杂异常，并在无交互异常的数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能有效检测复杂交互异常，还提供可解释性，可与传统VAD方法结合提升解释能力

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DScenePrompt是一个视频生成框架，通过双时空条件机制和3D场景记忆实现长视频生成，支持精确相机控制并保持场景一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常基于单张图像或短视频片段进行条件生成，难以在生成长视频时保持场景一致性和精确的相机控制。

Method: 采用双时空条件机制：时间相邻帧用于运动连续性，空间相邻内容用于场景一致性。引入3D场景记忆来专门表示从输入视频中提取的静态几何，通过动态SLAM和动态掩码策略分离静态场景几何与动态元素。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在场景一致性、相机可控性和生成质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 3DScenePrompt能够有效维护长距离空间一致性，实现精确相机控制，同时保持计算效率和运动真实性。

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续掩码自回归运动变换器，结合门控线性注意力机制和RMSNorm模块，通过扩散变换器结构融合文本、语音和音乐等多种模态，实现全身多模态人体运动生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全身多模态人体运动生成的两个主要挑战：创建有效的运动生成机制，以及将文本、语音和音乐等多种模态整合到统一框架中。

Method: 开发连续掩码自回归运动变换器，采用因果注意力机制处理人体运动的序列特性，引入门控线性注意力和RMSNorm模块来关注关键动作并抑制异常运动或多模态异质分布带来的不稳定性。使用DiT结构扩散变换器条件，通过AdaLN和交叉注意力融合文本、语音和音乐信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在所有模态（文本到运动、语音到手势、音乐到舞蹈）上都优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多模态人体运动生成方面表现出色，代码将公开。

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

TL;DR: MathCanvas是一个赋予统一大型多模态模型内在视觉思维链能力的框架，通过视觉操作预训练和策略性视觉辅助推理微调，显著提升数学问题的解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本推理方面表现出色，但在依赖视觉辅助的数学领域（如几何）表现不佳。现有的视觉思维链方法受限于僵化的外部工具，无法生成高质量、策略性时机的图表。

Method: 分为两个阶段：1）视觉操作预训练，使用1520万对语料（1000万图表生成对和520万编辑轨迹）训练图表生成和编辑能力；2）策略性视觉辅助推理微调，使用21.9万示例的视觉-文本交织推理路径数据集，教会模型何时以及如何利用视觉辅助。

Result: 基于该框架训练的BAGEL-Canvas模型在MathCanvas-Bench基准上比强大多模态模型基线相对提升了86%，在其他公共数学基准上也表现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个完整的工具包（框架、数据集和基准），为解锁多模态模型中复杂、类人的视觉辅助推理能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

*Thao Nguyen,Jiaqi Ma,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Souhaib Ben Taieb,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成令牌注意力的扩散模型，用于降水临近预报，无需单独潜在模块即可有效建模长距离时空依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在降水临近预报中存在可扩展性问题：潜在空间方法需要单独的自编码器，增加了复杂性；像素空间方法计算量大且缺乏注意力机制，难以建模长距离时空依赖。

Method: 在U-Net扩散模型和时空编码器中集成令牌注意力，动态捕获多尺度空间交互和时间演化，无需单独潜在模块。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最优方法，在复杂降水预报场景中具有更好的局部保真度、泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的令牌注意力集成方法有效解决了扩散模型在降水临近预报中的可扩展性问题，实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ChangingGrounding基准和Mem-ChangingGrounder方法，用于在动态变化的场景中通过利用历史观察来高效定位3D物体，减少重新扫描需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉定位方法假设点云数据已重建且最新，这需要昂贵的重新扫描，阻碍实际部署。需要将3DVG重新定义为主动、记忆驱动的问题。

Method: Mem-ChangingGrounder方法结合跨模态检索与轻量级多视图融合：识别查询隐含的物体类型，检索相关记忆指导行动，高效探索目标场景，回退无效操作，执行多视图扫描，并将融合证据投影得到精确边界框。

Result: 在ChangingGrounding基准上评估不同基线，Mem-ChangingGrounder实现了最高的定位精度，同时大幅降低了探索成本。

Conclusion: 该基准和方法推动了面向实际应用的、以记忆为中心的3DVG研究发展。

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

TL;DR: Ponimator是一个基于近距离交互姿态的动画生成框架，使用两个条件扩散模型从交互姿态生成动态运动序列或合成交互姿态，支持图像驱动交互动画、反应动画和文本到交互合成等多种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类能够从近距离交互姿态直观推断上下文并预测动态的启发，旨在利用交互姿态先验将高质量动作捕捉数据的交互知识迁移到开放世界场景。

Method: 使用两个条件扩散模型：姿态动画器利用时间先验从交互姿态生成动态运动序列；姿态生成器利用空间先验从单姿态、文本或两者合成交互姿态。

Result: 在多样化数据集和应用中的实证实验证明了姿态先验的普适性以及框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ponimator框架通过交互姿态先验实现了从高质量动作捕捉数据到开放世界场景的交互知识迁移，支持多种交互动画任务。

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出无需配对数据的图像编辑训练新范式，通过扩散模型展开和视觉语言模型反馈进行端到端优化，在少步设置下达到与监督学习方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型依赖大规模输入-目标配对数据进行监督微调，但自然配对的图像数据难以大规模获取，而使用合成训练数据会传播预训练模型的缺陷。

Method: 在训练时展开少步扩散模型，利用视觉语言模型评估编辑是否遵循指令并保留未改变内容，提供直接梯度进行端到端优化，同时结合分布匹配损失确保视觉保真度。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，无需任何配对数据，该方法在少步设置下与使用大量监督配对数据训练的扩散模型性能相当，且优于基于强化学习的技术如Flow-GRPO。

Conclusion: 该方法成功消除了对配对数据的依赖，通过直接优化和视觉语言模型反馈实现了高质量的图像编辑，为无监督图像编辑提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel
inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to
combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting
strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous
evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to
evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that
our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems.

TL;DR: 提出了DOTechnique方法，通过决策一致性而非输出相似性来确定模型有效性，集成领域约束和符号推理来提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义的有效性框架，但这些框架可能不可用或不充分，需要一种新的模型有效性评估方法。

Method: DOTechnique方法通过评估替代模型是否与高保真模型产生等效决策来确定有效性区域，即使没有明确的有效性边界。

Result: 以高速公路变道系统为例，展示了DOTechnique能够发现仿真模型的有效性区域。

Conclusion: 该技术有潜力通过决策者上下文来支持发现模型有效性。

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

Conclusion: 集成视觉信息（特别是演示文稿幻灯片）可以显著提升语音识别性能，尤其是在处理领域特定术语时，为多模态语音识别在专业场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否会在面对经典认知科学范式（列联判断任务）时产生因果幻觉，这种认知偏见被认为是许多社会问题的基础。

Method: 构建了1000个医学领域的零相关情境数据集，在这些情境中可用信息不足以建立变量间的因果关系，然后提示LLMs评估潜在原因的有效性。

Result: 所有评估的模型都系统性地推断出无根据的因果关系，显示出对因果幻觉的强烈易感性。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持LLMs可能只是复制因果语言而非真正理解因果关系的假设，并对在需要准确因果推理的领域中使用语言模型提出了担忧。

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要特定领域的神经网络架构且难以扩展，GammaZero旨在通过统一的图表示框架解决这些问题，实现跨问题规模的泛化能力。

Method: 将信念状态系统性地转换为动作中心图，使用图神经网络和编码器架构从专家演示中学习价值函数和策略，然后应用这些学习到的启发式方法来指导更大问题上的蒙特卡洛树搜索。

Result: 在标准POMDP基准测试中，GammaZero在相同规模问题上与BetaZero表现相当，同时能够在训练时未见过的2-4倍大规模问题上实现零样本泛化，保持解质量的同时减少搜索需求。

Conclusion: GammaZero通过动作中心图表示框架成功解决了POMDP规划中的可扩展性问题，证明了学习到的结构模式可以跨问题规模转移，为大规模POMDP问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前沿AI模型监管提案因安全与创新的权衡而被搁置，需要一种既能确保AI安全又不阻碍创新的监管方法。

Method: 强制要求大型AI实验室发布小型开放类比模型作为公共代理，允许广泛参与安全验证、可解释性研究和算法透明度工作，而不需要披露全规模模型。

Result: 研究表明，使用这些小型模型开发的安全和可解释性方法能有效推广到前沿规模系统，显著降低监管负担并加速安全进步。

Conclusion: 这种监管方法成本最小，利用可重用资源，显著促进公共利益，并通过深化对模型的理解来缓解安全与创新的权衡，实现两者兼得。

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

Conclusion: STEMS框架在极端天气条件下表现出强鲁棒性，在不同建筑类型中保持有效性，为协调建筑能源管理提供了有效的安全约束解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一语义和形式化属性，实现了多智能体AI系统的行为推理、形式化验证、协调边界情况检测以及死锁和安全漏洞预防。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

### [111] [A Multimodal Approach to Heritage Preservation in the Context of Climate Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14136)
*David Roqui,Adèle Cormier,nistor Grozavu,Ann Bourges*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级多模态架构，融合传感器数据和视觉图像来预测文化遗产地的退化严重程度，在数据稀缺情况下显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产地因气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测方法无法捕捉环境压力与材料退化之间的复杂相互作用。

Method: 采用改进的PerceiverIO架构，包含简化编码器（64D潜在空间）和自适应Barlow Twins损失函数，鼓励模态互补性而非冗余。

Result: 在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上达到76.9%准确率，比标准多模态架构提升43%，比单模态方法显著提升（传感器61.5%，图像46.2%）。

Conclusion: 架构简化与对比正则化相结合，可在数据稀缺的遗产监测环境中实现有效的多模态学习，为AI驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习研究进展迅速，但在商业视频游戏中的应用仍然缓慢。本文旨在解决游戏AI社区在实际使用RL驱动NPC时面临的挑战，并探索RL与行为树的结合点。

Method: 使用AMD Schola插件在虚幻引擎中训练RL代理，创建多任务NPC，并在受《最后生还者》启发的复杂3D环境中展示联合训练RL模型与行为树的方法。

Result: 验证了RL与行为树结合方法的可行性，展示了在复杂3D环境中创建多任务NPC的各种技能。

Conclusion: RL与行为树的结合是一个值得进一步探索的关键交汇点，尽管已有研究提出这种结合，但实际应用仍然罕见，本文证明了这种方法的实际可行性。

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JEDA是一个联合嵌入模型，用于直接从临床对话中检索规范医嘱，支持查询和无查询两种模式，实现实时临床医嘱检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床对话混合了明确指令和隐含推理，现有LLM重写方法存在延迟、不稳定和不透明问题，阻碍实时医嘱处理。

Method: 基于PubMedBERT初始化，使用重复安全对比目标微调，通过约束LLM指导将不同意图表达对齐到共享医嘱概念，支持查询和无查询两种检索模式。

Result: JEDA在实践中取得显著提升，大幅优于基础编码器和近期开源嵌入模型，无查询模式对噪音具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JEDA提供了一个快速、可解释、无需LLM的检索层，能够实时将环境上下文链接到可操作的临床医嘱。

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

Method: 使用基础模型从自然语言规范自动生成奖励机器，为每个自动机状态关联语言嵌入以实现任务间泛化，利用奖励机器的结构化形式化实现有效的任务分解。

Result: 在多种挑战性环境中验证了ARM-FM的有效性，包括展示了零样本泛化的证据。

Conclusion: ARM-FM通过结合基础模型和奖励机器，为强化学习提供了一种自动化的奖励设计方法，能够从自然语言规范生成有效的奖励函数，并实现任务泛化。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个在线骚扰代理基准，包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、基于重复博弈论的多代理模拟、三种越狱攻击方法以及混合评估框架。研究发现微调后的越狱攻击使骚扰成功率显著提高，并揭示封闭源和开源模型在骚扰升级轨迹上的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱研究主要关注单轮提示，而真实骚扰通常发生在多轮交互中，需要开发更贴近现实的评估框架来测试LLM代理的安全性。

Method: 构建了包含多轮骚扰对话数据集的基准，采用基于重复博弈论的多代理模拟，设计了针对记忆、规划和微调的三种越狱攻击方法，并使用混合方法评估框架。

Result: 越狱微调使骚扰成功率大幅提升（Llama从57-64%升至96%，Gemini从98%升至99%），拒绝率降至1-2%。侮辱和辱骂是最普遍的毒性行为，封闭源模型显示出显著脆弱性。

Conclusion: 多轮和理论基础的攻击不仅成功率高，还能模拟人类骚扰动态，强调了开发强大安全防护措施的必要性，以确保在线平台的安全和负责任。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

Conclusion: 奖励来源和数据规模是开放领域智能体学习的关键因素，多角色协同进化是实现可扩展自我改进智能体的有效方法。

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released
in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

TL;DR: GuardSpace是一个安全对齐保护框架，通过分解预训练权重为安全相关和安全无关组件，并构建零空间投影器来在微调过程中保持模型的安全行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在微调过程中容易丧失预训练的安全对齐能力，即使使用良性数据或低秩适配也会产生有害响应，需要保护安全机制。

Method: 使用协方差预条件奇异值分解将预训练权重分解为安全相关和安全无关组件，从安全无关组件初始化低秩适配器并冻结安全相关组件，同时构建零空间投影器限制适配器更新对有害提示的响应。

Result: 在多个预训练模型和下游任务上的实验表明，GuardSpace优于现有方法。对于在GSM8K上微调的Llama-2-7B-Chat，平均有害分数从14.4%降至3.6%，准确率从26.0%提升至28.0%。

Conclusion: GuardSpace框架有效解决了LLM微调过程中的安全对齐退化问题，在保持安全性的同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires

unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: MASC是一个元认知框架，通过实时无监督的步骤级错误检测和自校正来增强多智能体系统的鲁棒性，防止错误级联传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中单个错误步骤会传播并破坏整个轨迹的问题，提高系统的容错能力。

Method: 采用两种互补设计：1) 基于历史的下一个执行重构来预测下一步嵌入以捕捉因果一致性；2) 原型引导增强，学习正常步骤嵌入的原型先验来稳定稀疏上下文下的重构和异常评分。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，MASC显著优于所有基线方法，步骤级错误检测AUC-ROC提升高达8.47%，并在多种MAS框架中带来一致的端到端性能提升。

Conclusion: MASC的元认知监控和针对性校正能够以最小开销有效缓解错误传播，提高多智能体系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了AI4Service新范式，通过Alpha-Service框架实现主动式AI助手，能够从第一人称视角视频中检测服务机会并提供个性化服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI服务大多是被动的，只能响应明确指令，而真正智能的助手应该能够预测用户需求并在适当时机主动采取行动。

Method: 基于AI眼镜构建Alpha-Service框架，包含五个核心组件：输入单元（感知）、中央处理单元（任务调度）、算术逻辑单元（工具使用）、记忆单元（长期个性化）和输出单元（人机交互），采用多智能体系统实现。

Result: 通过案例研究（实时21点顾问、博物馆导游、购物搭配助手）展示了系统能够无缝感知环境、推断用户意图，并在无需明确提示的情况下提供及时有用的帮助。

Conclusion: AI4Service范式通过Alpha-Service框架成功实现了主动式AI助手，为日常生活中的实时辅助服务开辟了新方向。

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IP-Merging是一种无需调优的方法，通过识别多模态大语言模型（MLLM）和数学大语言模型中的推理相关参数，将它们投影到MLLM的子空间并进行合并，从而直接提升MLLM的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的数学推理能力落后于纯文本大语言模型，但直接合并模型参数存在对齐问题，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出IP-Merging方法：1）识别MLLM和数学LLM中的推理相关参数；2）将这些参数投影到MLLM的子空间以保持对齐；3）在子空间中合并参数。

Result: 实验表明IP-Merging能够在不损害MLLM其他能力的情况下，直接从数学LLM中吸收数学推理能力。

Conclusion: IP-Merging是一种有效的无需调优方法，能够显著提升MLLM的数学推理性能，同时保持其原有能力。

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

TL;DR: Hi-Agent是一个可训练的分层视觉语言代理，用于移动设备控制，通过高层推理模型和低层动作模型的联合优化，在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的移动设备控制方法大多依赖直接的状态-动作映射，缺乏结构化推理和规划，导致在新任务或未见UI布局上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出分层代理架构，包含高层推理模型和低层动作模型，通过将多步决策重新表述为单步子目标序列，并设计前瞻优势函数，利用低层模型的执行反馈来指导高层优化，缓解GRPO在长时任务中的路径爆炸问题。

Result: 在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于提示式(17.7%)、监督学习(54.5%)和强化学习方法(71.9%)。在ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中表现出竞争力的零样本泛化能力，在AndroidWorld基准测试中随着骨干网络增大而有效扩展。

Conclusion: Hi-Agent通过分层设计和联合优化策略，在移动设备控制任务中实现了最先进的性能，并展示了良好的泛化能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理和规划任务中仍面临挑战，多智能体系统虽然能提供更好的集体推理，但存在推理成本高、延迟长和端到端训练困难等问题。

Method: 提出IMAGINE框架，将多智能体系统的能力集成到单个模型中，通过简单的端到端训练实现性能提升。

Result: 使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型，在TravelPlanner基准上达到82.7%的最终通过率，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，同时保持更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功将多智能体系统的能力集成到单个紧凑模型中，显著提升了推理和规划性能，同时降低了模型规模和推理成本。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种转换方法，用于消除PDDL公理中派生谓词的负出现，证明这种限制与分层公理集具有相同的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDDL标准限制公理体中谓词的负出现只能用于直接由动作设置的谓词，而文献中常偏离此限制仅要求公理集可分层。本文旨在证明这两种变体具有相同的表达能力。

Method: 提出了一种转换方法，通过消除派生谓词的负出现，将包含负出现的公理集转换为符合PDDL标准限制的形式。

Result: 证明了两类公理变体都能表达与最小不动点逻辑完全相同的查询，表明派生谓词的负出现可以被消除。

Conclusion: 通过提出的转换方法，验证了PDDL标准限制与分层公理集在表达能力上的等价性，为PDDL公理设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的解决方案与手工构建的基线方法竞争，且往往更优。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了向复杂去中心化AI系统自动化工程迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

Motivation: 随着AI系统发展，用户期望增加，需要LLM与外部工具交互。但工具数量增加导致提示膨胀，带来高token成本、延迟增加和任务成功率降低的问题。

Method: JSPLIT将工具组织成层次化分类学结构，使用用户提示基于查询和分类学结构识别并仅包含最相关工具。

Result: JSPLIT显著减少提示大小而不显著影响代理响应能力。当可用工具大幅增加时，甚至能提高工具选择准确性，在复杂代理环境中降低成本同时提高任务成功率。

Conclusion: JSPLIT框架有效解决了MCP工具使用中的提示膨胀问题，通过分类学驱动的工具选择在保持性能的同时降低成本，特别适用于工具数量庞大的复杂代理环境。

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

Conclusion: 研究展示了预训练LLM向开放端适应的潜力和当前局限，为训练代理管理记忆、有效探索和追求抽象长期目标指明了未来方向。

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Rose-Frame框架，用于诊断人类与AI交互中的认知和认识论漂移，通过三个维度（地图vs领土、直觉vs理性、冲突vs确认）来识别AI系统的局限性，强调将AI直觉置于人类理性监督之下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然流畅且情感共鸣强，但基于统计预测而非有根据的推理，存在幻觉风险。它们实现了系统1认知的规模化运作，快速、联想且具有说服力，但缺乏反思和证伪能力。

Method: 引入Rose-Frame三维诊断框架：地图vs领土（区分现实表征与现实本身）、直觉vs理性（基于双过程理论区分快速情感判断与慢速反思思维）、冲突vs确认（检验观点是通过批判性测试还是简单相互验证）。

Result: Rose-Frame不试图通过更多数据或规则来修复LLM，而是提供一个反思工具，使模型的局限性和用户的假设可见，实现更透明和批判性意识强的AI部署。

Conclusion: 将对齐重新定义为认知治理：无论是人类还是人工智能的直觉，都必须受人类理性的支配。只有通过嵌入反思性、可证伪的监督，才能将机器的流畅性与人类的理解对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

Method: 开发了RABAT评估工具，整合了Cochrane偏倚风险、PROBAST和微软负责任AI检查表等成熟框架，对35篇同行评审研究进行了系统文献综述。

Result: 分析显示普遍存在差距：虽然数据采样和缺失数据实践记录良好，但大多数研究忽略了明确的公平性框架、亚组分析以及潜在危害的透明讨论。

Conclusion: 提出了ACAR四阶段公平性框架和可操作建议，帮助公共卫生ML从业者持续考虑算法偏见，确保算法创新促进而非损害健康公平。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

*Marco Simoni,Aleksandar Fontana,Andrea Saracino,Paolo Mori*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TITAN是一个连接自然语言网络威胁查询与结构化知识图谱推理的框架，包含路径规划模型和图执行器，支持在MITRE威胁情报上进行双向推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索系统无法在威胁情报知识图谱上进行清晰的推理，需要连接自然语言查询与可执行的推理路径。

Method: 集成路径规划模型预测关系链，图执行器遍历TITAN本体图谱，使用88209个训练样本的数据集进行训练评估。

Result: 实验表明TITAN能生成语法有效且语义连贯的推理路径，可在底层图谱上确定性执行。

Conclusion: TITAN框架成功实现了自然语言威胁查询到结构化知识图谱推理的桥梁，支持威胁、行为和防御之间的可逆推理。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

*Bianca Maria Lerma,Rafael Peñaloza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出NAEL（非人类中心伦理逻辑）框架，基于主动推理和符号推理，为智能体建立非人类中心的伦理系统，将伦理行为形式化为在动态多智能体环境中最小化全局期望自由能量的涌现特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI伦理方法过于人类中心化，无法适应智能体在不确定环境中的伦理决策需求。现有伦理模型缺乏上下文敏感性、适应性和关系性，且预设了人类道德直觉。

Method: 采用神经符号架构，结合主动推理和符号推理，使智能体能够评估在不确定环境中的行为伦理后果。通过最小化全局期望自由能量来形式化伦理行为。

Result: 通过伦理资源分配的案例研究，展示了NAEL能够动态平衡自我保存、认知学习和集体福利，实现上下文敏感的自适应伦理行为。

Conclusion: NAEL框架成功克服了现有伦理模型的局限性，使智能体能够发展出非人类中心、上下文敏感、适应性强的关系性伦理行为，为AI伦理提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

TL;DR: COUP算法配置方法的实用性能改进研究，通过一系列改进使其在保持理论保证的同时，在实证性能上达到与广泛使用的启发式配置方法相当的水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COUP是一种基于效用理论的算法配置方法，主要关注理论保证而忽略了实际性能。本文旨在弥补这一差距，使基于理论的功利算法配置在实际应用中具有竞争力

Method: 提出了一系列对COUP的改进措施，在不降低理论保证的前提下提升其经验性能，并通过实验验证这些改进的效果

Result: 改进后的COUP在实证性能上能够与广泛使用的启发式配置方法竞争，同时保持理论保证

Conclusion: 成功将基于理论的功利算法配置方法提升到实用水平，并通过案例研究展示了如何探索算法选择问题解决方案对效用函数变化的鲁棒性

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

TL;DR: 提出了PAVE方法，通过知识感知子空间净化任务向量，消除任务无关冗余，提高模型合并性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法中，任务向量包含任务无关冗余导致性能下降，随机丢弃参数的方法缺乏知识感知

Method: 使用训练样本获取协方差矩阵，进行上下文导向的奇异值分解，在知识感知子空间中分离任务相关和冗余组件，通过谱秩分配策略进行公平剪枝

Result: PAVE作为即插即用方案，在各种任务向量合并方法中都能有效提升性能

Conclusion: PAVE方法能够有效净化任务向量，减少合并模型性能下降，适用于多种合并方法和模型架构

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoAST是一个认知对齐的时空大语言模型框架，通过自然语言界面整合世界知识、时空轨迹模式、用户画像和情境信息，用于下一个兴趣点推荐任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM主要基于非结构化文本预训练，缺乏对结构化地理实体和顺序移动模式的本地理解，且工业级POI预测需要整合世界知识和人类认知对齐（如季节、天气、假期、用户画像等）来提升用户体验和推荐性能。

Method: CoAST包含两个阶段：(1) 推荐知识获取：在去敏感化的用户时空轨迹数据上进行持续预训练；(2) 认知对齐：通过监督微调和强化学习阶段，使用丰富训练数据将认知判断与人类偏好对齐。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的广泛离线实验和部署在AMAP App首页"猜你要去哪"的在线实验证明了CoAST的有效性。

Conclusion: CoAST框架成功解决了LLM在POI推荐任务中的局限性，通过整合时空知识和认知对齐显著提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合细粒度束搜索和过程奖励模型ToolPRM的推理扩展框架，用于提升大语言模型在函数调用等结构化输出任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理扩展研究主要关注非结构化输出生成任务，而在函数调用等结构化输出领域的应用尚未充分探索，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了首个细粒度函数调用过程监督数据集，使用函数掩码技术自动标注步骤级奖励，训练ToolPRM过程奖励模型来评分单个函数调用的内部步骤。

Result: ToolPRM在预测准确性上优于粗粒度和结果奖励模型，配备ToolPRM的推理扩展技术显著提升了骨干模型在各种函数调用任务和基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了将推理扩展技术应用于结构化输出的关键原则："多探索少保留"，这是由于结构化函数调用生成的不可恢复性特征决定的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SimKO方法解决RLVR中的过度集中问题，通过不对称设计提升探索能力，改善pass@K性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在系统性偏差，倾向于利用而非探索，表现为pass@1提升但pass@K下降

Method: 分析训练动态发现概率集中效应，提出SimKO方法：对正确响应提升top-K候选概率，对错误响应惩罚top-1候选

Result: 在数学和逻辑推理基准测试中，SimKO显著提升各种K值的pass@K性能

Conclusion: SimKO通过缓解概率过度集中问题，有效提升RLVR的探索能力

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

TL;DR: Datalake Agent是一个代理系统，通过交互式循环减少NL2SQL任务中的元信息使用，显著降低LLM的token消耗和成本，同时保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL2SQL方法在处理大量数据库元信息时会产生冗长提示和高处理成本，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用交互式循环和推理框架，让LLM选择性请求必要信息来解决表格问答任务，而不是一次性提供所有元信息。

Result: 在23个数据库和100个表格问答任务上评估，Datalake Agent将LLM使用的token减少高达87%，成本大幅降低，性能保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Datalake Agent通过智能信息选择机制，有效解决了NL2SQL任务中的高成本问题，为大规模数据库应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升具身智能体在长视野操作任务中的推理能力，解决当前大语言模型和视觉语言模型在复杂真实环境中执行长时程操作任务时面临的常识和推理能力限制问题。

Method: 两阶段微调框架：监督训练从专家序列获取基础知识，强化学习解决模型的视觉空间理解和推理不足。设计了基于规则的奖励函数，同时考虑长时程性能和动作约束。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B上训练得到的推理模型，在EmbodiedBench基准上比GPT-4o-mini高出21.33%，比在Qwen2.5-VL-7B上训练的其他工作高出20.33%。

Conclusion: RoboGPT-R1框架有效提升了具身智能体的推理能力，证明了强化学习在弥补监督微调不足方面的价值，特别是在视觉空间理解和多步推理任务中。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

*Ben Elder,Evelyn Duesterwald,Vinod Muthusamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting是一种后生成方法，通过增加指令遵循率来提高LLM提示指令的可靠性，在2条指令时提升7个百分点，10条指令时提升4个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者通常通过修改提示来影响LLM行为，但仅添加更多指令无法保证它们会被遵循，需要提高指令遵循的可靠性。

Method: 引入Instruction Boosting作为后生成方法，并创建SCALEDIF基准测试，包含最多10条指令的数据样本，还开发了定量冲突评分工具。

Result: Instruction Boosting显著提高了指令遵循率，同时发现性能下降与指令间的冲突和紧张程度相关。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了多指令场景下的LLM性能，冲突评分工具为开发者提供了评估指令影响的反馈。

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种紧凑的形式理论来描述和衡量由领域先验引导的LLM辅助迭代搜索，通过模糊关系算子表示智能体，引入覆盖生成函数和可达性难度度量，为LLM构建的迭代搜索提供系统性形式化描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的生成-过滤-精炼迭代范式在推理、编程和科学发现方面取得进展，但搜索效果依赖于如何将领域先验编码到操作化结构化的假设空间中。

Method: 将智能体表示为输入输出的模糊关系算子来捕捉可行转换，通过单一延续参数加权所有可达路径求和得到覆盖生成函数，从而诱导出可达性难度度量，并提供可测试的推断。

Result: 开发了一个可操作的语言和工具来测量智能体及其搜索空间，通过多数投票实例验证了理论推断。

Conclusion: 该理论为LLM构建的迭代搜索提供了系统性的形式化描述框架，能够有效衡量搜索过程和智能体性能。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

*Fikresilase Wondmeneh Abebayew*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Gatekeeper Protocol框架，通过让智能体先在低保真潜在状态上操作，按需请求高保真上下文，解决LLM智能体的上下文窗口限制和状态不同步问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为自主智能体部署时，受限于有限的上下文窗口和状态不同步，导致输出不可靠、行为不可预测、资源使用效率低，特别是在与代码库和文档等结构化知识系统交互时。

Method: 引入Gatekeeper Protocol框架，智能体先在低保真潜在状态表示上进行操作和推理，然后按需请求高保真上下文。所有交互通过统一的JSON格式进行，作为声明式、状态同步的协议。

Result: 在软件开发的参考实现Sage中，该方法显著提高了智能体可靠性，通过最小化token消耗改善了计算效率，并实现了与复杂系统的可扩展交互。

Conclusion: Gatekeeper Protocol为在任何结构化知识领域构建更稳健、可预测和基于现实的AI智能体提供了基础方法论。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种证据驱动、透明的解决方案，为更稳健、可问责、可扩展、高效、灵活、适应性强和协作的解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

*Akira Okutomi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将康德的《纯粹理性批判》重新解释为反馈稳定性理论，提出复合不稳定性指数(H-Risk)来量化推理系统的过自信问题，并在线性高斯模拟和LLMs中验证该指标与错误校准和幻觉的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将康德的理性自我限制理论与反馈控制理论联系起来，为诊断和减少推理系统中的过自信问题提供原则性框架。

Method: 提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk（结合谱边界、条件数、时间敏感性和创新放大），在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中进行实验验证。

Result: 在线性高斯模拟中，更高的H-Risk预测过自信错误；在LLMs中，脆弱的内部动态与错误校准和幻觉相关，批判式提示对校准和幻觉的影响不一。

Conclusion: 建立了康德自我限制与反馈控制之间的结构性桥梁，为诊断和选择性减少推理系统中的过自信提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

TL;DR: GroundedPRM是一个基于树搜索和外部工具验证的自动过程监督框架，通过MCTS构建结构化推理路径，使用外部工具验证中间步骤，结合步骤级验证和全局评估，仅用少量自动标注数据就能显著提升过程推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型面临三大挑战：噪声奖励、低事实保真度以及与步骤级推理目标的不对齐。这些问题源于依赖昂贵的人工标注、易产生幻觉的LLM自评估，或仅从最终结果推断步骤质量的蒙特卡洛估计方法。

Method: 1）使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径，实现细粒度信用分配；2）通过外部工具验证每个中间步骤，提供执行基础的正确性信号；3）设计混合奖励聚合机制，融合工具验证和MCTS反馈；4）将奖励信号格式化为增强推理的生成结构。

Result: 仅使用4万个自动标注样本（最佳自动监督PRM数据量的10%），在ProcessBench上实现了高达26%的相对性能提升。在奖励引导的贪心搜索中，甚至超越了使用人工标注监督训练的PRM。

Conclusion: GroundedPRM为高质量过程级推理提供了一条可扩展且可验证的路径，通过结合树搜索指导和保真度感知的验证机制，有效解决了现有PRM的核心局限性。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能够学习创造性任务，特别是复杂机器的设计能力，这是人类智能的重要标志和工程实践的基础。

Method: 构建BesiegeField测试平台（基于Besiege游戏），支持基于部件的构建、物理模拟和奖励驱动评估；使用代理工作流程对最先进的LLMs进行基准测试；探索强化学习微调作为改进路径。

Result: 当前开源模型在空间推理、战略组装和指令遵循等关键能力上表现不足；通过强化学习微调实验发现改进潜力，但存在语言、机器设计和物理推理交叉领域的开放挑战。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在复杂机器设计方面具有潜力，但需要进一步发展空间推理和物理理解能力；强化学习是提升模型性能的有效途径，但该领域仍面临重要挑战。

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多模态假内容类型未知，而现有方法通常只针对单一类型（人工虚假信息或AI生成内容）进行专门研究，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 构建了包含12.7万样本的OmniFake数据集，提出了UMFDet框架，使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知的MoE适配器和归因思维链机制来捕获类别特定的欺骗信号。

Result: UMFDet在两种虚假信息类型上都实现了稳健且一致的性能，优于专门的基线方法。

Conclusion: UMFDet为现实世界多模态欺骗检测提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够有效处理未知类型的虚假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.
