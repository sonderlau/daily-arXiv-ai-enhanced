### [1] [LO-SDA: Latent Optimization for Score-based Atmospheric Data Assimilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22562)
*Jing-An Sun,Hang Fan,Junchao Gong,Ben Fei,Kun Chen,Fenghua Ling,Wenlong Zhang,Wanghan Xu,Li Yan,Pierre Gentine,Lei Bai*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LO-SDA的新型生成式数据同化方法，使用变分自编码器和背景条件扩散模型来学习大气条件分布，通过潜在空间优化确保生成状态与稀疏观测的一致性，在高维全球大气系统中超越了传统数据同化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯数据同化方法采用高斯背景先验作为维度诅咒的折中方案，但这简化了大气动力学的非线性特性，可能导致有偏估计。需要解决高斯先验假设的局限性。

Method: 首先训练变分自编码器学习紧凑的潜在表示以解耦复杂大气相关性；在潜在空间中使用背景条件扩散模型直接从数据中学习条件分布；在扩散模型的反向过程中引入潜在优化以确保生成状态与稀疏观测的严格一致性。

Result: 理想化实验表明，LO-SDA不仅优于基于扩散后验采样的得分数据同化方法，也超越了传统数据同化方法。这是首次有基于扩散的数据同化方法在高维全球大气系统中展现出超越传统方法的潜力。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，在生成建模进展的背景下，长期以来对高斯先验的依赖——这是业务大气数据同化中的基础假设——可能不再必要。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) plays a pivotal role in numerical weather prediction
by systematically integrating sparse observations with model forecasts to
estimate optimal atmospheric initial condition for forthcoming forecasts.
Traditional Bayesian DA methods adopt a Gaussian background prior as a
practical compromise for the curse of dimensionality in atmospheric systems,
that simplifies the nonlinear nature of atmospheric dynamics and can result in
biased estimates. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generative DA
method, LO-SDA. First, a variational autoencoder is trained to learn compact
latent representations that disentangle complex atmospheric correlations.
Within this latent space, a background-conditioned diffusion model is employed
to directly learn the conditional distribution from data, thereby generalizing
and removing assumptions in the Gaussian prior in traditional DA methods. Most
importantly, we introduce latent optimization during the reverse process of the
diffusion model to ensure strict consistency between the generated states and
sparse observations. Idealized experiments demonstrate that LO-SDA not only
outperforms score-based DA methods based on diffusion posterior sampling but
also surpasses traditional DA approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first
time that a diffusion-based DA method demonstrates the potential to outperform
traditional approaches on high-dimensional global atmospheric systems. These
findings suggest that long-standing reliance on Gaussian priors-a foundational
assumption in operational atmospheric DA-may no longer be necessary in light of
advances in generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候模型中的参数化方案往往导致物理偏差，AI技术能够从数据中学习未解析过程，从而改进气候模拟的物理准确性。

Abstract: Climate simulations, at all grid resolutions, rely on approximations that
encapsulate the forcing due to unresolved processes on resolved variables,
known as parameterizations. Parameterizations often lead to inaccuracies in
climate models, with significant biases in the physics of key climate
phenomena. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are now directly enabling
the learning of unresolved processes from data to improve the physics of
climate simulations. Here, we introduce a flexible framework for developing and
implementing physics- and scale-aware machine learning parameterizations within
climate models. We focus on the ocean and sea-ice components of a
state-of-the-art climate model by implementing a spectrum of data-driven
parameterizations, ranging from complex deep learning models to more
interpretable equation-based models. Our results showcase the viability of
AI-driven parameterizations in operational models, advancing the capabilities
of a new generation of hybrid simulations, and include prototypes of fully
coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice hybrid simulations. The tools developed are
open source, accessible, and available to all.

### [3] [Dynamics and Model Representation of Two Contrasting Extreme Precipitation Events in the Sahel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23174)
*Souleymane Sanogo,Marlon Maranan,Andreas H. Fink,Beth J. Woodhams,Peter Knippertz*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 研究马里两个城市极端洪水降水事件，比较ICON模型在启用和禁用对流参数化时的表现，发现模型技能具有案例依赖性，EXPLC在干环境中表现更好而PARAM在湿环境中更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究极端降水事件的结构特征、动力强迫机制，以及评估ICON模型在模拟这些事件时的能力，特别关注对流参数化的影响。

Method: 使用ICON模型进行两组实验（启用和禁用对流参数化），通过FSS和SAL空间验证方法与IMERG卫星降水数据对比，并应用热带波谱滤波分析。

Result: 两个案例均由西传气旋性涡旋相关的有组织对流系统引起，但环境条件不同；EXPLC在干环境（San案例）表现更好，而PARAM在湿环境（Kenieba案例）能有效模拟对流组织。

Conclusion: ICON模型的性能具有案例依赖性，EXPLC在模拟对流组织方面存在系统性缺陷，而PARAM在将丰富水汽转化为强降水方面更有效。

Abstract: Two extreme flood-inducing precipitation events in two cities in Mali, on 08
August 2012 in San (127 mm) and on 25 August 2019 in Kenieba (126 mm), are
investigated with respect to rainfall structures, dynamical forcings, and the
ability of the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model to represent their
evolution. Two sets of experiments with convective parameterization enabled
(PARAM) and disabled (EXPLC), both at 6.5 km grid spacing, are conducted for
each case. While the (thermo)dynamical fields of the simulations are compared
with ERA5 reanalysis data, the rainfall fields are tested against the
satellite-based precipitation dataset IMERG by applying the spatial
verification methods Fractions Skill Score (FSS) and the
Structure-Amplitude-Location (SAL) score. In addition, a spectral filtering of
tropical waves is applied to investigate their impact on the extreme events.
The most prominent results are: (1) Both cases were caused by organized
convective systems associated with a westward propagating cyclonic vortex, but
differ in their environmental setting. Although both cases featured an east
African wave (AEW), the San case involved convective enhancement along dry
Saharan airmasses, whereas the Kenieba case occurred within an unusual
widespread wet environment extending deep into the Sahel. (2) Although EXPLC
captures the rainfall distribution in the San case better than PARAM, it fails
to organize convection in the moisture-laden Kenieba case, which PARAM is
capable of simulating. (3) The FSS confirms the case-dependency of the ICON
skill. The SAL method hints towards a systematic deficiency of EXPLC to
represent the convective organization by producing too many scattered and weak
rainfall systems, while PARAM is more effective in converting abundant moisture
into excessive rainfall.

### [4] [Structure-Aware Cooperative Ensemble Evolutionary Optimization on Combinatorial Problems with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21906)
*Jie Zhao,Kang Hao Cheong*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型(MLLM)的进化算法框架，通过图像编码和图形稀疏化技术解决图结构组合优化问题，提高了解决方案的质量和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统进化算法在图结构组合问题中使用的编码方案难以有效捕捉网络的复杂结构特性，需要更直观的结构感知优化方法。

Method: 采用图像编码保留拓扑上下文，利用MLLM作为进化算子；使用图形稀疏化简化大规模网络可视化；提出协作进化优化框架促进跨域知识转移；引入集成策略通过共识投票聚合不同布局配置的输出。

Result: 在真实世界网络上的实验表明，该方法在MLLM驱动的进化优化中提高了解决方案的质量和可靠性。

Conclusion: 基于MLLM的进化优化框架能够有效处理图结构组合问题，通过图像编码、稀疏化技术和集成策略显著提升了优化性能。

Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have proven effective in exploring the vast
solution spaces typical of graph-structured combinatorial problems. However,
traditional encoding schemes, such as binary or numerical representations,
often fail to straightforwardly capture the intricate structural properties of
networks. Through employing the image-based encoding to preserve topological
context, this study utilizes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as
evolutionary operators to facilitate structure-aware optimization over graph
data. To address the visual clutter inherent in large-scale network
visualizations, we leverage graph sparsification techniques to simplify
structures while maintaining essential structural features. To further improve
robustness and mitigate bias from different sparsification views, we propose a
cooperative evolutionary optimization framework that facilitates cross-domain
knowledge transfer and unifies multiple sparsified variants of diverse
structures. Additionally, recognizing the sensitivity of MLLMs to network
layout, we introduce an ensemble strategy that aggregates outputs from various
layout configurations through consensus voting. Finally, experiments on
real-world networks through various tasks demonstrate that our approach
improves both the quality and reliability of solutions in MLLM-driven
evolutionary optimization.

### [5] [Enabling Robust In-Context Memory and Rapid Task Adaptation in Transformers with Hebbian and Gradient-Based Plasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21908)
*Siddharth Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文研究了在Transformer中引入生物启发的可塑性机制，比较了基于赫布规则和梯度更新的两种方法，发现赫布可塑性在少样本学习任务中表现更好，而梯度更新在长期信用分配中更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时依赖静态权重，而生物系统通过突触可塑性持续适应。研究旨在探索显式的生物启发可塑性是否能赋予Transformer更快的序列内适应能力。

Method: 在仅解码器Transformer中增加快速权重模块，使用两种更新机制：(i)神经调节的赫布规则，(ii)Duan等人(2023)的基于梯度的可塑性机制。在复制、回归和少样本分类任务上进行测试。

Result: 赫布可塑性在损失和少样本泛化方面表现更好，而基于梯度的更新在长期信用分配中表现最佳。当关联短且线性可分时，静态权重足够，这定义了可塑性何时有帮助的边界条件。

Conclusion: 显式可塑性通过实现快速、任务特定的适应来补充注意力机制，并阐明了不同可塑性机制在何时最有效。

Abstract: Large language models display in-context learning as an emergent effect of
scale, but they rely on static weights during inference. In contrast,
biological systems continually adapt via synaptic plasticity. We investigate
whether explicit, biologically inspired plasticity can endow Transformers with
faster in-sequence adaptation. To this end, we augment decoder-only
Transformers with fast-weight modules updated either by (i) a neuromodulated
Hebbian rule or (ii) the gradient-based plasticity mechanism of Duan et al.
(2023). Across copying, regression, and few-shot classification tasks
(CIFAR-FS, Omniglot), Hebbian plasticity consistently achieves lower loss and
stronger few-shot generalization, while gradient-based updates perform best on
long-horizon credit assignment. When associations are short and linearly
separable, static weights suffice, defining a clear boundary condition for when
plasticity helps. Analysis of learned modulatory signals reveals that
gradient-based rules maintain large, persistent updates, whereas Hebbian
plasticity is sharply gated around salient events. Together, these results show
that explicit plasticity complements attention by enabling rapid, task-specific
adaptation, and clarify when different plasticity mechanisms are most
effective.

### [6] [Probing the Representational Geometry of Color Qualia: Dissociating Pure Perception from Task Demands in Brains and AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22800)
*Jing Xu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该研究通过比较AI模型与人脑在颜色主观体验表征几何上的差异，发现当前前馈架构无法捕捉任务执行相关的认知过程，CLIP训练对ViT和ConvNet的神经对齐效果相反，揭示了人工与生物视觉系统在归纳偏置上的根本差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索主观体验（qualia）的计算基础是认知神经科学的核心挑战，本研究旨在通过比较AI模型与人脑在颜色主观体验表征几何上的差异来推进这一问题的研究。

Method: 使用独特的fMRI数据集和"无报告"范式，通过表征相似性分析（RSA）比较多种视觉模型在两种条件下的神经活动：纯感知（无报告）和任务调制感知（报告）。

Result: 1. 几乎所有模型与纯感知的神经表征更一致；2. CLIP训练对ViT和ConvNet的神经对齐效果相反；3. 揭示了人工与生物视觉系统在归纳偏置上的根本差异。

Conclusion: 研究为颜色主观体验领域提供了新的基准任务，揭示了人工与生物视觉系统的根本差异，为开发更具神经合理性的模型提供了明确指导。

Abstract: Probing the computational underpinnings of subjective experience, or qualia,
remains a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. This project tackles
this question by performing a rigorous comparison of the representational
geometry of color qualia between state-of-the-art AI models and the human
brain. Using a unique fMRI dataset with a "no-report" paradigm, we use
Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to compare diverse vision models
against neural activity under two conditions: pure perception ("no-report") and
task-modulated perception ("report"). Our analysis yields three principal
findings. First, nearly all models align better with neural representations of
pure perception, suggesting that the cognitive processes involved in task
execution are not captured by current feedforward architectures. Second, our
analysis reveals a critical interaction between training paradigm and
architecture, challenging the simple assumption that Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training(CLIP) training universally improves neural plausibility. In our
direct comparison, this multi-modal training method enhanced brain-alignment
for a vision transformer(ViT), yet had the opposite effect on a ConvNet. Our
work contributes a new benchmark task for color qualia to the field, packaged
in a Brain-Score compatible format. This benchmark reveals a fundamental
divergence in the inductive biases of artificial and biological vision systems,
offering clear guidance for developing more neurally plausible models.

### [7] [Graph Neural Network Assisted Genetic Algorithm for Structural Dynamic Response and Parameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22839)
*Sagnik Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合图神经网络(GNN)和遗传算法(GA)的混合数据驱动框架，用于高效优化结构参数(m,k,c)，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值方法如FEM和CFD虽然精度高，但在迭代优化中计算成本昂贵，需要为每个参数组合求解控制方程。

Method: 使用GNN作为代理模型学习结构参数与动态位移响应的非线性映射，结合GA进行全局优化，数据集通过Newmark Beta方法生成SDOF系统响应。

Result: 该框架实现了强收敛性、鲁棒泛化能力，相比传统仿真显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 机器学习代理模型与进化优化相结合的方法在自动化智能结构设计中具有显著效果。

Abstract: The optimization of structural parameters, such as mass(m), stiffness(k), and
damping coefficient(c), is critical for designing efficient, resilient, and
stable structures. Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element
Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide
high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative
optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations
for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven
framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a
Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is
trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters
and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without
repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom
(SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across
diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for
globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and
enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework
achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced
computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach
highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with
evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.

### [8] [One-Timestep is Enough: Achieving High-performance ANN-to-SNN Conversion via Scale-and-Fire Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23383)
*Qiuyang Chen,Huiqi Yang,Qingyan Meng,Zhengyu Ma*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种单时间步ANN到SNN转换的理论框架，通过时空等价理论证明多时间步IF神经元可等效替换为单时间步多阈值神经元，并开发了Scale-and-Fire神经元和基于SFN的脉冲Transformer，在单时间步推理下达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ANN到SNN转换方法依赖大时间步，导致高推理延迟和计算成本。需要开发能够在单时间步下高效运行的SNN转换方法。

Method: 提出时空等价理论，证明多时间步IF神经元可等效替换为单时间步多阈值神经元；引入Scale-and-Fire神经元实现有效单时间步脉冲；开发SFN-based Spiking Transformer，将脉冲模式与注意力分布对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架为单时间步ANN到SNN转换提供了理论和实践基础，显著降低了推理延迟和计算成本，同时保持了高精度。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are gaining attention as energy-efficient
alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), especially in
resource-constrained settings. While ANN-to-SNN conversion (ANN2SNN) achieves
high accuracy without end-to-end SNN training, existing methods rely on large
time steps, leading to high inference latency and computational cost. In this
paper, we propose a theoretical and practical framework for single-timestep
ANN2SNN. We establish the Temporal-to-Spatial Equivalence Theory, proving that
multi-timestep integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons can be equivalently replaced by
single-timestep multi-threshold neurons (MTN). Based on this theory, we
introduce the Scale-and-Fire Neuron (SFN), which enables effective
single-timestep ($T=1$) spiking through adaptive scaling and firing.
Furthermore, we develop the SFN-based Spiking Transformer (SFormer), a
specialized instantiation of SFN within Transformer architectures, where spike
patterns are aligned with attention distributions to mitigate the
computational, energy, and hardware overhead of the multi-threshold design.
Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and instance
segmentation demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
under single-timestep inference. Notably, we achieve 88.8% top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K at $T=1$, surpassing existing conversion methods.

### [9] [Multi-Task Surrogate-Assisted Search with Bayesian Competitive Knowledge Transfer for Expensive Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23407)
*Yi Lu,Xiaoming Xue,Kai Zhang,Liming Zhang,Guodong Chen,Chenming Cao,Piyang Liu,Kay Chen Tan*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种贝叶斯竞争知识转移(BCKT)方法，用于改进多任务代理辅助搜索(MSAS)在处理昂贵优化问题时的性能，通过贝叶斯视角评估知识可转移性，实现自适应知识利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 经验验证表明该方法能有效提升各种SAS算法在多任务和众任务问题上的性能，比较研究证明了其相对于同类算法的优越性以及在现实场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: BCKT方法通过贝叶斯竞争机制成功解决了知识转移中的负迁移问题，为昂贵优化问题提供了有效的多任务代理辅助搜索解决方案。

Abstract: Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) present significant challenges for
traditional evolutionary optimization due to their limited evaluation calls.
Although surrogate-assisted search (SAS) has become a popular paradigm for
addressing EOPs, it still suffers from the cold-start issue. In response to
this challenge, knowledge transfer has been gaining popularity for its ability
to leverage search experience from potentially related instances, ultimately
facilitating head-start optimization for more efficient decision-making.
However, the curse of negative transfer persists when applying knowledge
transfer to EOPs, primarily due to the inherent limitations of existing methods
in assessing knowledge transferability. On the one hand, a priori
transferability assessment criteria are intrinsically inaccurate due to their
imprecise understandings. On the other hand, a posteriori methods often
necessitate sufficient observations to make correct inferences, rendering them
inefficient when applied to EOPs. Considering the above, this paper introduces
a Bayesian competitive knowledge transfer (BCKT) method developed to improve
multi-task SAS (MSAS) when addressing multiple EOPs simultaneously.
Specifically, the transferability of knowledge is estimated from a Bayesian
perspective that accommodates both prior beliefs and empirical evidence,
enabling accurate competition between inner-task and inter-task solutions,
ultimately leading to the adaptive use of promising solutions while effectively
suppressing inferior ones. The effectiveness of our method in boosting various
SAS algorithms for both multi-task and many-task problems is empirically
validated, complemented by comparative studies that demonstrate its superiority
over peer algorithms and its applicability to real-world scenarios. The source
code of our method is available at https://github.com/XmingHsueh/MSAS-BCKT.

*Alexa R. Tartaglini,Satchel Grant,Daniel Wurgaft,Christopher Potts,Judith E. Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FUGU是一个数据可视化理解任务套件，用于诊断视觉语言模型在图表理解中的错误来源。研究发现错误主要源于视觉-语言模块间的信息传递问题，而非视觉编码本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在数据可视化理解任务上表现不佳，但失败原因尚不明确。研究旨在确定错误是源于视觉信息编码、视觉-语言模块间信息传递，还是语言模块内部处理的问题。

Method: 开发FUGU任务套件，使用激活修补和线性探针技术追踪信息流，分析三种广泛使用的VLMs在不同提示策略下的表现，并测试提供正确坐标和微调的效果。

Result: 模型常无法正确生成单个数据点坐标，这些初始错误导致最终回答错误。当提供正确坐标时性能显著提升，且错误回答时仍能从视觉编码器中读取正确坐标。但提供坐标对需要统计关系的任务反而有害，微调也无法达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs存在架构限制，视觉-语言模块间的信息传递是主要瓶颈，这对可靠的数据可视化理解构成重大挑战。

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

*Mihir Gupta,Pratik Desai,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种成本效益高的自一致性框架，通过语义聚类和余弦相似度共识机制，提高农业图像字幕生成的可靠性，在PlantVillage数据集上显著提升了诊断准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决发展中国家农业病害管理面临的挑战：缺乏植物病理学专家、网络连接不可靠、部署大规模AI系统成本高昂。

Method: 使用轻量级预训练嵌入模型进行语义聚类，通过余弦相似度选择最一致的字幕；结合人机交互组件，用户确认作物类型以过滤错误生成。

Result: 在800张作物病害图像上测试，单聚类共识方法准确率达83.1%（基线77.5%）；考虑多个聚类时准确率提升至94.0%（基线88.5%）。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提高了农业图像字幕生成的可靠性，为资源受限环境下的农业病害管理提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya,
and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant
pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that
hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a
cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model
(VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method
employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding
model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent
caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and
prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A
practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user
confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring
higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly
available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model,
our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods.
Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our
single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10
candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy
decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when
considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response
is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5%
achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.
Both models are released on HuggingFace:

Conclusion: 该框架证明了仅使用合成数据就能学习丰富的3D交互感知能力，为计算机视觉、机器人和AI中的交互理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face-MakeUpV2是一个面部图像生成模型，通过构建大规模数据集和引入双通道面部信息注入，解决了文本到图像模型中的面部属性泄漏和物理一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在响应局部语义指令时存在面部属性泄漏和物理一致性不足的问题，需要开发能够保持面部ID和物理特征一致性的生成模型。

Method: 1) 构建包含约100万图像-文本-掩码对的大规模数据集FaceCaptionMask-1M；2) 使用通用文本到图像预训练模型作为骨干，引入3D面部渲染通道和全局面部特征通道；3) 制定语义对齐和感知损失两个优化目标。

Result: 广泛实验表明，Face-MakeUpV2在保持面部ID和参考图像物理一致性方面实现了最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: Face-MakeUpV2在可靠和可控的面部编辑应用中具有实际潜力。

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究量化了紧凑二进制人脸模板的纵向稳定性，发现64位和128位模板的年龄漂移分别为1.357和2.571比特/十年，表明随着时间推移类内距离会系统性增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究紧凑二进制人脸模板的长期稳定性，量化年龄变化对模板匹配性能的影响，为智能卡和片上匹配部署提供参考。

Method: 使用PCA-ITQ将现代人脸CNN的浮点嵌入压缩为64位和128位二进制码，对AgeDB数据库中每个身份建立汉明距离与绝对年龄差的线性模型。

Result: 在566个身份中，64位模板的中位漂移为1.357比特/十年，128位模板为2.571比特/十年，分布主要为正值，表明类内距离随时间系统性增加。

Conclusion: 较短编码在固定决策阈值下具有更好的年龄稳定性，建议采用定期重新注册和针对不稳定比特位的奇偶校验等简单缓解措施。

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的深度学习框架，用于通过细针穿刺图像特征进行乳腺癌早期检测，在实现高精度的同时提供模型解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在医疗应用中因黑盒特性而难以获得临床采纳的问题，需要在保持高性能的同时提供可解释性。

Method: 使用深度神经网络（ReLU激活、Adam优化器、二元交叉熵损失），并集成SHAP和LIME等模型无关的可解释AI技术来生成特征级归因和可视化。

Result: 模型达到0.992准确率、1.000精确率、0.977召回率和0.988 F1分数，显著优于传统算法，且发现细胞核凹点是影响分类的最重要特征。

Conclusion: 该框架成功弥合了深度学习性能与可解释性之间的差距，为乳腺癌临床诊断提供了既准确又可信的解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the
early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from
digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural
network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy
loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of
0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the
literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of
well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and
found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing
that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due
to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic
Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level
attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the
contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis,
and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and
interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the
cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting
the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key
characteristics of breast tumor.

TL;DR: EdgeSync是一种高效的边缘模型更新方法，通过改进样本过滤和动态训练管理，解决实时视频分析中模型准确率下降和更新延迟的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频分析系统在边缘设备部署轻量模型以减少延迟，但数据特征分布随时间变化（如光照、天气条件变化）会导致模型准确率下降。现有方法面临重训练计算密集和模型与当前视频流数据分布不匹配的挑战。

Method: EdgeSync通过结合时效性和推理结果来增强样本过滤，确保训练样本与当前视频内容更相关；同时采用动态训练管理模块优化模型更新的时机和顺序。

Result: 在多样复杂的真实世界数据集上的评估表明，EdgeSync相比现有方法准确率提升约3.4%，相比传统方法提升约10%。

Conclusion: EdgeSync通过高效的样本过滤和动态训练管理，有效解决了边缘模型更新中的延迟和准确率问题，显著提升了实时视频分析系统的性能。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing
methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文首次全面评估了SAM2变体在火焰分割任务中的表现，重点研究了边界框提示策略对部署可行性的提升。实验表明边界框提示优于自动和单点方法，轻量级变体更适合边缘部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火焰分割在计算机视觉中具有挑战性，而SAM/SAM2模型的跨域泛化能力在火焰分割任务中的有效性尚未充分探索，特别是在移动部署约束下。

Method: 系统评估了四种SAM2.1变体和两种移动导向变体，在三个火焰数据集上使用多种提示策略：自动、单正点、单正点+单负点、多正点、边界框及其混合变体。

Result: 边界框提示方法表现最佳，Box+MP在Khan数据集上获得最高平均IoU(0.64)和Dice系数(0.75)。轻量级变体显著降低了内存和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该工作为在火焰监控系统中部署可提示分割模型提供了关键见解，并为领域特定SAM应用建立了基准。

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

*Guo Li,Yuyang Yu,Xuemiao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对扩散模型的高效成员推理攻击方法，通过注入轻微噪声并评估噪声分布的聚合程度来区分训练集和非训练集样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）的广泛使用带来了隐私风险，特别是成员推理攻击，即判断特定数据样本是否用于模型训练过程。

Method: 基于噪声注入和噪声分布聚合度评估。假设成员图像在扩散过程的某个时间步上表现出更高的预测噪声聚合度，而非成员图像则表现出更离散的特征。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集上表现优异，相比现有方法需要更少访问目标扩散模型。在大规模文本到图像扩散模型中，ASR和AUC指标也显示出更好的攻击效果。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了扩散模型存在成员推理攻击的隐私风险，且提出的攻击方法具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可微分渲染器的相机位姿估计协方差下界的闭式计算方法，通过将渲染器视为测量函数，在流形上线性化图像形成过程，得到渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管位姿估计在计算机视觉和机器人领域应用广泛，但现有工作很少为密集或学习模型下的位姿提供严格的不确定性量化。

Method: 将可微分渲染器作为测量函数，在流形上对图像形成过程进行线性化，推导出渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。该方法与经典捆绑调整不确定性理论保持连续性，并能自然地扩展到多智能体设置。

Result: 得到了相机位姿估计协方差的闭式下界，该下界与经典视觉理论一致，并能通过融合多个相机的Fisher信息扩展到多智能体场景。

Conclusion: 该统计公式在合作感知和新视角合成等下游任务中具有应用价值，无需显式的关键点对应关系。

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

TL;DR: 提出了AVEP任务，这是一个基于视频的事件预测任务，区别于传统视频预测，包含更复杂的逻辑和语义信息。构建了包含3.5万标注视频和17.8万视频片段的大型数据集，并提出EventFormer模型，在节点-图层次注意力机制下实现更好的事件预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类事件多以视频形式记录而非文本脚本，但在视觉领域缺乏相关研究。现有视频预测任务主要关注像素级重建，缺乏对复杂事件逻辑和语义信息的建模。

Method: 构建大型结构化视频事件数据集，以多模态事件参数节点为原子单位。提出EventFormer模型，采用节点-图层次注意力机制，能够捕捉事件与参数之间的关系以及参数间的共指关系。

Result: 在AVEP任务上，EventFormer模型优于多个SOTA视频预测模型和LVLMs，证明了任务的复杂性和数据集的价值。

Conclusion: AVEP任务为视频事件预测提供了新的研究方向，提出的数据集和EventFormer模型为解决复杂视频事件理解问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on
the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in
practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented
in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related
research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP
(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from
existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

Method: 提出失配方程，设计匹配和校准解决方案算法来构建新的测量矩阵，并在附录中提供了详细的方程和算法证明。

Conclusion: 该理论解决了测量矩阵未知时的图像重建问题，具有实际应用价值，但存在一定局限性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide
a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The
experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can
be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and
reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of
noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance.
The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness.
Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory.

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration
of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key
application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor
observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we
explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing
on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational
Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D
image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling
architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in
satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on
UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and
generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the
selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the
trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete
schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore
quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost
without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into
selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data
fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide
recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion
quality.

Conclusion: MAFR为融合视觉和几何信息提供了原则性方法，提升了工业异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D
and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a
novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and
composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and
geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial
anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/adabrh/MAFR

TL;DR: TITA是一个轻量级框架，通过冻结基础视觉语言模型并训练奖励模型来提供token级别的推理时对齐，减少幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型输出容易产生与视觉输入不符的幻觉文本，而现有的对齐方法要么依赖昂贵的微调，要么只能提供粗粒度的延迟反馈。

Method: 冻结基础VLM，训练奖励模型来近似其分布，在推理时提取隐式偏好信号作为奖励模型和目标VLM之间的对数概率比，提供密集的自回归反馈。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和13B上的广泛评估显示，在12个基准测试中持续提升，MMVet提升8.6%，POPE提升6.7%。在Qwen2.5-VL-7B和DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B上也显示出可比较的增益，特别是在幻觉减少和VQA准确性方面，且推理开销可忽略。

Conclusion: TITA框架有效减少了视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，提升了通用理解能力，同时保持了轻量级和高效的特点。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了HIBA架构和Xihe时间序列基础模型系列，通过分层块间和块内稀疏注意力有效捕捉多尺度时间依赖，在零样本迁移中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型直接采用跨领域架构，难以有效捕捉时间序列数据固有的多尺度时间依赖，特别是在零样本迁移到不同模式和采样策略的数据集时表现受限。

Method: 提出分层交错块注意力(HIBA)，使用分层块间和块内稀疏注意力：块内注意力促进局部信息交换，块间注意力跨块操作以捕捉全局时间模式交互和动态演化。

Result: Xihe系列从950万参数到15亿参数，在GIFT-Eval基准测试中，最小的Xihe-tiny(9.5M)超越多数现有TSFMs，Xihe-max(1.5B)在零样本性能上大幅超越之前最佳结果，建立新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: HIBA架构在整个参数范围内都表现出卓越性能，证明了其出色的泛化能力和架构优越性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

TL;DR: 该研究通过集成AI自动预标注功能来增强人机协同视频标注，在UCF-Crime数据集上测试表明，使用AI预标注可使70%的标注者减少35%的标注时间，同时保持相似的标注质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过集成AI自动能力来简化视频标注任务，减轻标注者负担并评估其性能表现，关注标注效率、准确性和整体质量的提升。

Method: 采用单次迭代方案，使用Label Studio平台和AI驱动的零样本预标注技术，在UCF-Crime数据集上进行正常与异常活动分类标注测试。

Result: AI预标注显著优化了视频标注流程，70%的标注者标注时间减少35%，标注质量与传统方法相当，且标注结果更一致、更符合视频帧的自然聚类。

Conclusion: AI自动预标注能够有效简化视频标注工作流程，赋能人类标注者并优化整体标注流水线，结果在不同资产持续时间和复杂度下保持一致。

Abstract: We explore the enhancement of Human-in-the-Loop video annotation by
integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess
their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the
annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of
its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall
annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation
tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal
and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic
AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合解剖结构图表示和视觉编码器的多模态框架，通过互信息最大化实现几何图嵌入与放射特征的融合，显著提升膝骨关节炎分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 膝骨关节炎（KOA）的X光诊断具有挑战性，因为标准深度学习模型难以有效捕捉细微的形态学细节。

Method: 使用Segment Anything Model（SAM）分割构建形态学图表示，结合视觉编码器，通过互信息最大化实现几何图嵌入与放射特征的融合。

Result: 在骨关节炎倡议数据集上，该方法比单模态基线准确率提高10%（达到近80%），比现有最先进方法准确率提高8%，F1分数提高11%。

Conclusion: 将解剖结构整合到放射学分析中对准确评估KOA严重程度至关重要。

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA
severity grading.

*Pedro Cisneros-Velarde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种使用两个并行采样器在有限去噪步骤下提高扩散模型采样质量的方法，通过适当整合两个采样器的信息来改善图像生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有限去噪步骤（即扩散模型评估次数受限）的情况下，如何提高采样图像的质量。

Method: 使用两个并行采样器在连续时间进行去噪步骤，并适当整合它们在潜在图像中的信息。该方法简单易实现，无需额外微调或外部模型。

Result: 通过自动化和人工评估验证了该方法对不同扩散模型的有效性，发现朴素的信息整合会降低采样质量，且增加更多并行采样器不一定能进一步改善质量。

Conclusion: 在有限去噪步骤下，两个并行采样器的适当信息整合可以有效提高扩散模型的采样质量，但需要精心设计整合策略，且并非采样器越多越好。

Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps,
i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

TL;DR: FDA-CLIP是一个基于CLIP的文本-视频检索框架，通过帧差生成动态区域掩码，引导模型关注语义关键动态区域，抑制静态背景冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本-视频检索方法依赖大规模标注数据、存在模态鸿沟的问题，以及现有CLIP适配方法缺乏动态视频特征增强和静态冗余特征抑制的不足。

Method: 使用帧差生成动态区域掩码，作为Alpha通道输入Alpha-CLIP，主动引导模型关注语义关键动态区域，抑制静态背景冗余。

Result: 实验证明帧差引导的视频语义编码能有效平衡检索效率和准确性。

Conclusion: FDA-CLIP框架通过动态区域关注机制，在文本-视频检索任务中实现了更好的性能平衡。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型主要关注单模态语言任务，在多模态场景特别是视觉语言任务中存在适应不足的问题，无法充分利用视觉上下文和常识知识，限制了跨多模态环境的泛化推理能力。

Method: 引入掩码预测任务MPCC，通过重建被遮挡图像的语义内容来强制模型整合视觉上下文和常识推理；开发了强化微调与先验采样(RFPS)训练方法；构建了专门的评估基准MPCC Eval。

Result: 提出的方法不仅提升了模型性能，还增强了在分布外和跨任务场景中的泛化推理能力。

Conclusion: MPCC任务和RFPS训练方法为多模态模型提供了有效的泛化推理基础，能够更好地适应多样化的多模态环境。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据标注成本高昂，现有范式无法平衡跨域迁移和跨类别泛化，需要领域自适应零样本学习(DAZSL)。虽然视觉语言模型(如CLIP)在DAZSL领域具有固有优势，但当前研究未能充分利用其潜力。

Method: 提出语义关系增强的CLIP(SRE-CLIP)适配器框架，包含语义关系结构损失和跨模态对齐保持策略，解决CLIP在DAZSL中的两个核心挑战。

Result: 作为首个基于CLIP的DAZSL方法，SRE-CLIP在I2AwA和I2WebV基准上达到最先进性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SRE-CLIP框架有效解决了DAZSL中CLIP模型的关键挑战，为数据受限场景下的深度学习模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose
a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a
Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention
Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly
outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态机器人导航系统越来越复杂且难以解释，而可解释系统往往性能不如不可解释系统。需要一种既能保持高性能又能解释决策的方法。

Method: 将动作语言描述作为强化学习导航的辅助任务，利用预训练的视觉语言模型进行知识蒸馏，解决缺乏真实描述数据的问题。

Result: 在各种导航任务中全面评估，证明该方法能够描述动作同时保持高导航性能，在语义视听导航任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了可解释性与性能之间的权衡问题，为可靠的多模态导航系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是糖尿病的主要并发症，在印度等高糖尿病患病率地区尤为严重。早期筛查至关重要，因为该病在初期无症状，但传统方法检测效果有限。

Method: 采用混合诊断框架，结合传统手工特征提取（捕捉关键临床标志物）和深度学习（自动化分层模式识别），融合可解释的临床数据与学习特征。

Result: 该模型超越了单独的深度学习方法，表现出更优的分类性能，并显著减少了假阴性病例。

Conclusion: 这种多模态AI驱动方法能够实现可扩展、准确的糖尿病视网膜病变筛查，对糖尿病负担重的地区尤为重要。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

Conclusion: YOLOv11凭借其出色的准确性和速度，在NEU数据集表面缺陷检测任务中超越其他竞争算法，是最有效的模型。

Abstract: This article compares the performance of six prominent object detection
algorithms, YOLOv11, RetinaNet, Fast R-CNN, YOLOv8, RT-DETR, and DETR, on the
NEU-DET surface defect detection dataset, comprising images representing
various metal surface defects, a crucial application in industrial quality
control. Each model's performance was assessed regarding detection accuracy,
speed, and robustness across different defect types such as scratches,
inclusions, and rolled-in scales. YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art real-time object
detection algorithm, demonstrated superior performance compared to the other
methods, achieving a remarkable 70% higher accuracy on average. This
improvement can be attributed to YOLOv11s enhanced feature extraction
capabilities and ability to process the entire image in a single forward pass,
making it faster and more efficient in detecting minor surface defects.
Additionally, YOLOv11's architecture optimizations, such as improved anchor box
generation and deeper convolutional layers, contributed to more precise
localization of defects. In conclusion, YOLOv11's outstanding performance in
accuracy and speed solidifies its position as the most effective model for
surface defect detection on the NEU dataset, surpassing competing algorithms by
a substantial margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地球观测基础模型需要额外适配，且结构围绕特定数据源或训练方法，缺乏灵活性。受大语言模型启发，希望通过统一序列框架简化EO数据使用。

Method: 采用简单的GPT风格解码器架构，通过符号提示在单一统一架构中执行多个监督和自监督任务，无需任务或模态特定适配。

Result: 尽管模型简单且缺乏空间上下文，但在作物类型分类任务(PASTIS-R)上优于更大的EO基础模型，证明密集时间序列建模是当前范式中缺失的关键要素。

Conclusion: SITS-DECO展示了数据为中心的建模范式，能力源于训练数据的多样性和结构而非架构复杂性，为未来生成式EO基础模型提供了轻量级实用路径。

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future
generative EO foundation models.

Motivation: 现有的GestureGPT解决方案在手势识别准确性和响应时间方面存在局限，需要开发更有效的自由手势理解系统来改善人机交互体验。

Method: 结合预训练大视觉语言模型进行手势语义对齐，引入地标处理模块嵌入解剖学手部先验知识，采用思维链推理策略进行逐步语义推理。

Result: Gestura实现了稳健且适应性强的自由手势理解，并开发了首个包含30万标注问答对的开源自由手势意图推理数据集。

Conclusion: Gestura通过多组件协同工作，显著提升了自由手势理解的性能，为无约束手势交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer
interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture
categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited
recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose
Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly
dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic
concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Method: 使用两个公共数据集（200张文化创意行业女性图像和230张博物馆策展人图像），评估个人属性、外观和随身物品的渲染准确性。

Result: DALL-E3在15.6%的属性（共710个）中偏离提示规范，随身物品错误最少，个人外观中等，人物年龄偏差最大。

Conclusion: 存在可测量的提示到图像保真度差距，这对偏见检测和模型评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study examines the prompt fidelity of ChatGPT4o / DALL-E3 text-to-image
visualisations by analysing whether attributes explicitly specified in
autogenously generated prompts are correctly rendered in the resulting images.
Using two public-domain datasets comprising 200 visualisations of women working
in the cultural and creative industries and 230 visualisations of museum
curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair),
appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While
correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications
in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia,
moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person
themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable
prompt-to-image fidelity gaps with implications for bias detection and model

Motivation: GAN生成图像的检测在数字图像取证中面临重大挑战，需要开发有效的检测方法来区分真实图像和GAN生成图像。

Method: 使用离散小波变换(DWT)预处理，应用Haar和Daubechies小波滤波器将图像转换为多分辨率表示，然后输入ResNet50网络进行分类。

Result: Haar和Daubechies预处理模型的准确率分别达到93.8%和95.1%，显著高于空间域模型的81.5%。Daubechies模型表现优于Haar。

Conclusion: GAN生成图像在小波域具有独特的伪影或"指纹"，小波域分析在检测GAN图像方面非常有效，为未来深度伪造检测系统的发展提供了潜力。

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has
become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research
presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the
StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters
are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations,
which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing
on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based
models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The
Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8
percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial
domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms
Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to
even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the
GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints."
The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to
detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the
capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的深度学习框架，使用ResNet50和DenseNet121检测脑部MRI肿瘤和胸部X光肺炎，通过Grad-CAM提供热力图可视化来提高模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像诊断中潜力巨大，但大多数模型缺乏可解释性，阻碍了临床信任和采用。

Method: 使用ResNet50和DenseNet121在Kaggle数据集（7,023张脑部MRI和5,863张胸部X光）上进行训练，集成Grad-CAM生成热力图可视化。

Result: DenseNet121在脑肿瘤检测中准确率94.3%（ResNet50为92.5%），肺炎检测中准确率89.1%（ResNet50为84.4%）。Grad-CAM显示DenseNet121更关注核心病理区域。

Conclusion: 结合深度学习和可解释AI为开发可靠、可解释且临床有用的诊断工具提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging
diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical
trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework
for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可靠性阈值度量和精心设计的特征来提高染色体分类精度，特别适用于低质量图像和低成本系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前核型分析系统需要大量高质量训练数据，但在偏远病理实验室中难以获得。为防止低质量图像下的误检，需要改进染色体分类精度。

Method: 使用改进的Alex-Net神经网络、SVM、K最近邻及其级联流水线，结合可靠性阈值度量和工程特征，对半直染色体进行自动过滤。

Result: 对于常见缺陷和易位的染色体，分类精度显著提高至90%以上。在极低质量G带数据库上获得高精度结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的阈值度量和剪枝方法适用于贫困国家和低预算病理实验室的核型分析设施。

Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase
analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially.
However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train
data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such
provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet
accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false
positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this
paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed
reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The
proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural
network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated
filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly
improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and
translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed
thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its
salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very
low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and
pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget
pathological laboratories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了STAR-64K数据集和两阶段训练框架，用于增强多模态大语言模型在结构化抽象推理任务上的能力，使小模型在STAR任务上超越GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在理解和推理视觉模态的抽象信息方面存在挑战，特别是多模态关系知识（MMRK）和结构化抽象推理（STAR）任务研究不足，缺乏高质量数据和能力增强方法。

Method: 开发了自动STAR数据引擎来合成包含MMRK的图像，构建多模态指令数据；提出了两阶段能力增强训练框架，包含专门针对不同STAR任务的评估协议。

Result: 构建了包含64K高质量多模态指令样本的STAR-64K数据集，在5个开源MLLMs上的实验表明，两阶段增强框架使3B/7B小模型在STAR任务上显著超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 提出的数据引擎和训练框架有效提升了MLLMs在结构化抽象推理任务上的性能，为多模态关系知识推理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth
analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability,
and scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合低秩Transformer和基于流的生成模型的框架，用于处理不完整多模态医疗数据的生存分析，通过类别特定流进行跨模态分布对齐，提高模态重建的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界医疗数据集常存在模态不完整问题，现有方法直接推断缺失模态但忽略了模态间的分布差异，导致重建结果不一致和不可靠。

Method: 使用类别特定流进行跨模态分布对齐，通过可逆结构和精确密度建模构建分布一致的缺失模态潜在空间；设计轻量级低秩Transformer建模模态内依赖关系，缓解高维模态融合的过拟合问题。

Result: 在完整模态设置下达到最先进性能，在不完整模态场景下保持鲁棒和优越的准确性。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效处理不完整多模态生存分析问题，通过分布对齐和低秩Transformer实现了稳健和灵活的预测性能。

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种垃圾图像分类方法：传统机器学习、深度学习以及混合方法，发现混合方法（深度学习特征提取+传统分类器）在三个公开数据集上表现最佳，准确率高达100%，同时通过特征选择大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前垃圾图像自动分类缺乏系统性的基准测试，需要整合机器学习、深度学习和高效混合解决方案来建立更可靠的评估标准。

Method: 比较三种方法：(1)基于手工特征的机器学习算法；(2)深度学习架构（ResNet变体和EfficientNetV2S）；(3)混合方法（深度学习特征提取+传统分类器如SVM和逻辑回归）。在三个公开数据集上进行实验。

Result: 混合方法在三个数据集上表现最优：TrashNet和精炼家庭垃圾数据集达到100%准确率，垃圾分类数据集达到99.87%准确率，超越了现有最佳基准。特征选择将特征维度降低95%以上而不损失精度。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了更可靠的垃圾分类基准，并提出了一种高效的混合框架，在保持高精度的同时降低推理成本，适合在资源受限环境中进行规模化部署。

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine
Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain
underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three
paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep
learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3)
a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public
datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage
Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet
and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby
surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces
feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in
faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks
for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that
achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for
scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 探索ChatGPT等大型语言模型在医学图像解释方面的潜力，特别是在无需微调的零样本场景下。

Method: 使用400张平衡测试图像（200正常/200肺炎），比较四种不同提示设计：从简单指令到详细推理提示。

Result: 简洁的特征导向提示达到74%分类准确率，而推理导向提示性能较低。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在医学图像解释方面显示出潜力，但诊断可靠性有限，需要进一步改进视觉推理和领域适应才能安全用于临床。

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

Motivation: 当前最先进的视频生成模型在物理理解方面存在严重限制，经常产生不合理的视频。视觉真实性并不等同于物理理解，而自监督学习在自然视频上的预训练已显示出直觉物理理解能力。

Method: 在MAGI-1视频生成模型基础上，耦合Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2)来指导生成过程，利用VJEPA-2作为奖励信号。

Result: 通过VJEPA-2奖励信号的引导，将最先进视频生成模型的物理合理性提高了约6%。

Conclusion: SSL-based视频世界模型可以有效提升视频生成模型的物理合理性，证明了自监督学习在改善视频生成物理理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the
PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025.
State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

TL;DR: RatioWaveNet通过可训练的有理小波变换前端增强TCFormer主干网络，在BCI-IV-2a和BCI-IV-2b数据集上显著提升了最难受试者的分类准确率，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于运动想象的脑机接口在非侵入式EEG解码中面临非平稳性、低信噪比和受试者变异性的挑战，特别是在最难受试者上表现不佳。

Method: 提出RatioWaveNet，包含可训练的有理小波变换前端进行多分辨率子带分解，结合多核CNN提取局部时空特征，分组查询注意力编码器捕获长程上下文，以及紧凑TCN头进行因果时间整合。

Result: 在BCI-IV-2a和BCI-IV-2b数据集上，RatioWaveNet相比Transformer主干网络，在受试者内和留一受试者外协议下，最差受试者准确率分别提升0.17/0.42和1.07/2.54个百分点，平均性能也有稳定提升。

Conclusion: 简单可训练的小波前端是增强基于Transformer的脑机接口的有效插件，能在不牺牲效率的情况下提高最差情况可靠性。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert
movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from
non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and
subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal
CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated
Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,
multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and
shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and
mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and
passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a
grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head
for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves
robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and
whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and
inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,
RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by
+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /
+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest
computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet
front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,
improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了模态失语症现象：统一多模态模型能准确视觉记忆概念但无法用文字表达，尽管同时训练了图像和文本。前沿模型能完美重现电影海报图像，却在文字描述中混淆关键细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前统一多模态模型中存在的系统性分离问题，即模型在视觉和文本模态间表现不一致，这可能对AI安全框架构成风险。

Method: 通过合成数据集上的受控实验，在多种架构中验证模态失语症现象，并展示仅对文本进行安全对齐的模型仍能生成不安全图像。

Result: 实验证实模态失语症是当前统一多模态模型的基本属性而非训练伪影，模型能生成完美图像但文字描述混乱，且文本安全对齐无法阻止不安全图像生成。

Conclusion: 模态失语症是统一多模态模型的固有缺陷，可能导致AI安全漏洞，因为单一模态的安全措施无法保护其他模态，需要跨模态安全对齐方法。

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在处理长上下文视觉信息时的挑战，特别是在GUI控制和网页导航等代理任务中。现有方法内存密集且不适合本地部署。

Method: 提出链式滚动机制选择性递归导航文档，使用专用数据生成管道构建信息轨迹，并采用情景组相对策略优化的强化学习方法。

Result: 方法显著减少内存使用，有效模拟人类阅读行为，是首个在多页文档问答中明确建模代理阅读模式的框架。

Conclusion: SCoPE VLM通过创新的导航机制和优化方法，提升了多模态代理在长文档理解方面的能力。

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge
for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control
and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently
structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document
understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily
extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these
methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions.
To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert
that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively
navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a
dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll
trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored
reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference.
Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like
reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first
framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document
question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PFCT的新方法，用于独立训练泊松流一致性模型，无需依赖预训练模型，在CT图像去噪任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PFCM模型只能通过蒸馏方法训练，这限制了其在多种数据模态中的应用潜力，因此需要开发独立的训练方法。

Method: 利用扰动核消除对预训练PFGM++的依赖，引入正弦离散化调度和Beta噪声分布来提高适应性和样本质量。

Result: 在低剂量CT图像去噪任务中，模型在LPIPS和SSIM指标上均有改善，去噪效果与一致性模型相当。

Conclusion: PFCT被证明是一种有效的PFCM独立训练方法，在生成建模领域具有应用潜力，但需要进一步优化和扩展到其他任务。

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

Motivation: 工程图纸是制造沟通的基础，但解释复杂的多视图图纸具有挑战性，传统方法难以处理变化的布局、方向和混合符号-文本内容。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) YOLOv11-det进行布局分割；2) YOLOv11-obb进行方向感知的细粒度检测；3) 两个基于Donut的视觉语言模型进行语义内容解析。

Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving
as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production
details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense
annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character
recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to
varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the
automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern
detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det
performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title
blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware,
fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&T symbols, and
surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free
VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and
categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM
interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&T frames, and surface
roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and
generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for
annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of
0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance
in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON
output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases,
providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

TL;DR: LSF-Animation是一个无需显式情感和身份标签的语音驱动3D面部动画框架，通过从语音中隐式提取情感信息、从中性面部网格中捕获身份特征，并引入分层交互融合块来整合各种线索，在未见过的说话者和情感状态下具有更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式的一热编码来表示身份和情感，需要给定的情感和身份标签，这限制了它们对未见说话者的泛化能力。此外，语音中固有的情感线索经常被忽视，限制了生成动画的自然性和适应性。

Method: 提出LSF-Animation框架，隐式从语音中提取情感信息，从中性面部网格中捕获身份特征，无需手动标签。引入分层交互融合块(HIFB)，使用融合令牌集成双变压器特征，更有效地整合情感、运动和身份相关线索。

Result: 在3DMEAD数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在情感表现力、身份泛化和动画真实感方面超越了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: LSF-Animation通过消除对显式情感和身份特征表示的依赖，实现了对未见说话者和情感状态的更好泛化，同时提高了动画的自然性和适应性。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

TL;DR: 提出了WM-MoE，首个基于世界模型的运动预测框架，通过统一感知、时间记忆和决策制定来解决高风险极端场景的挑战，在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在安全关键极端场景中表现不佳，因为训练数据中常见场景过度代表且泛化能力有限，需要提升自动驾驶车辆在极端情况下的运动预测可靠性。

Method: 构建紧凑场景表示，利用LLM增强长期推理，引入轻量级时间标记器，采用混合专家(MoE)分解复杂极端场景，路由器分配场景给专门专家进行意图推断和反事实推演。

Result: 在四个基准数据集(nuScenes、NGSIM、HighD、MoCAD)上的广泛实验显示，WM-MoE始终优于最先进基线方法，在极端场景和数据缺失条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于世界模型的架构为全自动驾驶车辆中鲁棒且可泛化的运动预测展示了前景，特别是在处理极端场景方面表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban
planning, effective environmental monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of
climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate
technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the
lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for
estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically
computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed
methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning
algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from
high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed
analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and
understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges
associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud
platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently
manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid
analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the
city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an
industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to
optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban
forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can
foster more resilient urban environments, contributing to a greener and
healthier future.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive
modeling, exemplified by models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP). In this paper, we propose the TernaryCLIP, a lightweight computational
framework that converts connection weights of both vision and text encoders of
CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones.
TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules,
preventing precision degradation and enabling low-cost and high-efficiency
computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TernaryCLIP can
achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98
$\times$ compression ratio, 2.3 $\times$ inference acceleration, 16 $\times$
storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while
maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and
image-text retrieval tasks across 41 commonly used datasets. Our work
highlights the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models,
supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning based generative models, particularly
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and
Diffusion Models (DMs), have been instrumental in in generating diverse,
high-quality content across various domains, such as image and video synthesis.
This capability has led to widespread adoption of these models and has captured

TL;DR: SPRINT是一种高效的扩散变换器训练方法，通过分层稀疏-密集融合策略，在保持生成质量的同时显著降低训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiTs)虽然生成性能优异，但训练成本随序列长度呈二次增长，大规模预训练极其昂贵。现有token丢弃方法要么参数过多，要么在高丢弃率下性能下降严重。

Method: 利用浅层和深层网络的互补作用：浅层处理所有token捕获局部细节，深层仅处理稀疏子集以减少计算，通过残差连接融合输出。采用两阶段训练：长时掩码预训练提高效率，短时全token微调缩小训练-推理差距。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，SPRINT实现9.8倍训练节省，FID/FDD指标相当。推理时，其路径丢弃引导(PDG)几乎减半FLOPs同时提升质量。

Conclusion: SPRINT为高效DiT训练提供了一个简单、有效且通用的解决方案，支持高达75%的token丢弃率而不损失质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance
but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale
pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost,
yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either
parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense
Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that
enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT
leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers
process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse
subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual
connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training
for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the
train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training
savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG)
nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as
a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

<details>

Motivation: 扩散模型在专业领域（如医学影像）的微调面临数据稀缺和计算成本高的问题，需要开发更高效的适应方法。

Method: 在冻结的扩散U-Net中集成轻量级适配层，结合潜在形态自编码器（用于领域特定潜在一致性）和像素级判别器（用于对抗对齐）进行训练。

Result: 在三个胸部X光数据集上的实验表明，Lite-Diff相比全模型微调实现了更优越的适应效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型在低数据领域的迁移学习提供了有前景的方向，促进了其在多样化领域的部署。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

TL;DR: FlowOpt是一个零阶优化框架，将整个流匹配过程视为黑盒，无需反向传播即可在整个采样路径上进行优化，用于图像编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流匹配模型在测试时进行受控生成任务时，由于采样过程的迭代性质，使用基于梯度的优化在计算上不切实际。现有方法通常需要分别操纵每个时间步。

Method: 提出FlowOpt框架，使用零阶（无梯度）优化方法，将整个流过程视为黑盒，允许通过整个采样路径进行优化而无需模型反向传播。

Result: FlowOpt在图像编辑任务中达到最先进结果，同时使用的神经函数评估次数与现有方法大致相同。

Conclusion: FlowOpt提供了一个高效、可监控的优化框架，能够处理流匹配模型中的受控生成任务，并提供了收敛保证。

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

similar gestures, such as ``Call'' and ``Yes''. This work opens up interesting
perspectives for applications in various fields such as healthcare, education
and public services.

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning
(ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and
improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is
to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an
image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be
misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel
spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates
a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting
caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the
most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the
standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly
towards developing robust ML models.

TL;DR: 提出了VLM-SlideEval评估框架，从三个维度测试视觉语言模型对幻灯片的理解能力：元素级提取、抗干扰鲁棒性和高层次理解。研究发现当前VLMs在像素级提取方面表现不佳，在单页内容理解上表现较好，但无法可靠捕捉跨页面的叙事结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型越来越多地用于评估多模态内容（包括演示幻灯片），但它们在幻灯片特定理解方面的能力尚未得到充分探索，特别是在作为智能代理管道中批评者的角色时。

Method: 使用从Zenodo公开获取的幻灯片数据集，通过PowerPoint XML和实时渲染标准化真实元素元数据，构建统一的验证模式。从三个维度评估VLMs：元素级提取、受控干扰下的鲁棒性（几何、样式、文本）以及高层次理解（如从乱序幻灯片恢复叙事顺序）。

Result: 实验表明，VLMs在像素级精确提取方面表现不佳；在受控干扰下显示出非平凡的协议性、保真度和一致性；在单页内容理解方面表现较好；但无法可靠捕捉跨幻灯片的叙事结构。

Conclusion: 这些结果凸显了当前VLMs在幻灯片评估方面的局限性，需要开发经过校准的、批评者在环的评估器，以推动智能代理管道中的迭代优化和选择。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal
content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding
remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic,
model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework
that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide
images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in
geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as
recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly
available decks from Zenodo
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we
standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live
renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on
pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and
consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on
single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture
narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of
current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop
evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

Motivation: 解决监控视频异常检测面临的挑战：异常事件多样性、类别不平衡和场景相关的视觉干扰。

Method: 使用YOLO-World检测人体实例，ByteTrack进行身份跟踪，高斯模糊抑制背景，InceptionV3提取空间特征，双向LSTM建模时序动态。

Result: 在UCF-Crime五类子集上平均测试准确率92.41%，各类别F1分数均超过0.85，表现出良好的泛化能力和对类别不平衡的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 聚焦前景的预处理方法显著提升了真实监控场景中的异常识别能力。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GIFT方法，通过跟踪视觉注意力变化生成显著性图，在解码时同时增强显著视觉信息和用户查询的注意力，有效减少VLMs中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要归因于VLMs过度依赖语言先验知识而非视觉输入，但忽略了视觉注意力沉没问题（注意力被错误分配到任务无关区域）和跨模态融合平衡问题。

Method: GIFT方法预计算整体视觉显著性图，通过跟踪用户查询理解过程中的视觉注意力正向变化（"注视转移"），在解码步骤中利用该图同时增强显著视觉信息和用户查询的注意力。

Result: 广泛实验表明，GIFT在生成和分类任务中有效减少VLMs的幻觉，相比贪婪解码提升高达20.7%，同时保持通用视觉语言性能且计算开销低。

Conclusion: GIFT通过解决视觉注意力沉没问题并确保平衡的跨模态融合，有效缓解了VLMs中的幻觉问题，是一种简单而有效的方法。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描器型号、采集协议和成像站点的差异会引入变异性，阻碍多中心研究的一致分析和泛化能力。

Method: 使用基于结构相似性指数(SSIM)的可微损失函数，将解剖内容与扫描器和站点特定变化解耦，同时保留生物学意义特征。

Result: 协调后结构SSIM达到0.97，亮度SSIM为0.98-0.99，Wasserstein距离显著降低；脑年龄预测MAE从5.36年降至3.30年，阿尔茨海默病分类AUC从0.78提升至0.85。

Conclusion: 该框架增强了跨站点图像一致性，保持了解剖保真度，并改善了下游模型性能，为大规模多中心神经影像研究提供了稳健且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

Method: 提出Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG)方法：通过扰乱视觉位置编码进行辅助解码，识别位置无关的预测倾向，然后使用有限状态机指导数字预测以纠正偏差。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验表明，VPSG能可靠地改善坐标预测性能，验证了位置编码鲁棒性对空间推理的重要性。

Conclusion: 位置编码的鲁棒性是MLLM空间推理能力的关键瓶颈，VPSG提供了一种无需训练的有效解决方案来纠正坐标预测中的系统性偏差。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: Rainbow是一个条件图像生成框架，通过将输入条件分解为捕捉不确定性的多样化潜在表示来生成多样化的图像，适用于任何预训练的条件生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过修改随机种子或多样化输入提示来生成多样化图像，但难以区分样本间的有意义差异，且语言可解释的多样性有限。需要解决条件/提示中固有的不确定性，生成多样化的合理图像。

Method: 在提示表示计算中集成由生成流网络参数化的潜在图，利用GFlowNets的高级图采样能力捕获不确定性并输出图上的多样化轨迹，产生多个表示输入条件的轨迹，从而得到多样化的条件表示和相应的输出图像。

Result: 在自然图像和医学图像数据集上的评估表明，Rainbow在图像合成、图像生成和反事实生成任务中，在多样性和保真度方面都有所提升。

Conclusion: Rainbow框架通过分解输入条件为多样化潜在表示，有效解决了条件图像生成中的不确定性，能够生成多样化的合理图像，适用于各种预训练的条件生成模型。

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间推理任务上表现不佳，现有数据生成方法存在3D重建误差和生成幻觉问题，导致数据集质量较低。

Method: 仅使用标准物体检测器的2D边界框来确定定性空间关系，避免3D重建和生成模型的问题。

Result: 生成的数据集达到91.16%的人类验证准确率，相比现有方法的57.6%有显著提升。模型在空间推理概念上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GRAID框架能够生成高质量的视觉问答数据集，有效提升模型的空间推理能力，并具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality
than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human
evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo
datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions
spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We
evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated
accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work.
% or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data,
models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6
question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\%
on BDD and 37.9\% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all
questions types, achieve improvements on several existing benchmarks such as
BLINK. The GRAID framework, datasets, and additional information can be found

TL;DR: CogStereo是一个新颖的立体匹配框架，通过嵌入隐式空间认知来改进具有挑战性区域（如遮挡或弱纹理）的视差估计，无需依赖数据集特定先验，在跨域泛化方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度立体匹配方法在基准数据集上表现良好，但在零样本泛化方面不如其他视觉任务中的基础模型。需要解决遮挡、弱纹理等挑战性区域的视差估计问题。

Method: 使用单目深度特征作为先验，将隐式空间认知嵌入到细化过程中；采用双条件细化机制，结合像素级不确定性和认知引导特征，进行一致的全局误匹配校正。

Result: 在Scene Flow、KITTI、Middlebury、ETH3D、EuRoc和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，CogStereo不仅达到了最先进的性能，而且在跨域泛化方面表现出色。

Conclusion: CogStereo将立体视觉推向认知驱动的方法，即使在几何信息不足的区域也能确保结构一致的视差估计。

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through
fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation
models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that
addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without
relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition
into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors,
capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This
approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas
where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional
refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided
features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments
on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that
CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in
cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现优异，但对输入损坏引起的分布偏移很脆弱，需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Mint方法，使用均值累加器和梯度累加器在测试时最大化基于伪标签的类间方差，有效处理小批量数据。

Result: Mint方法在多个损坏基准测试和CLIP架构中一致提升性能，验证了最大化类间方差的有效性。

Conclusion: 嵌入方差崩溃与性能下降密切相关，通过最大化类间方差可以显著提升CLIP在损坏图像上的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了egoEMOTION数据集，这是首个结合自我中心视觉和生理信号与密集情感和人格自我报告的数据集，包含50+小时记录，定义了三个基准任务：连续情感分类、离散情感分类和人格特质推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自我中心视觉基准大多忽略影响人类决策和行动的情感状态，仅关注物理活动和手物交互，假设中性情感和统一人格，限制了视觉系统捕捉行为内部驱动因素的能力。

Method: 使用Meta的Project Aria眼镜收集43名参与者的同步眼动视频、头戴式光电容积描记、惯性运动数据和生理基线，参与者完成情感诱发任务和自然活动，同时使用Circumplex模型和Mikels' Wheel自我报告情感状态，使用大五人格模型报告人格。

Result: 基于经典学习方法的简单基线在现实世界情感预测中，从自我中心视觉系统捕获的信号比处理生理信号产生更好的估计。

Conclusion: 该数据集将情感和人格确立为自我中心感知的核心维度，为基于情感的行为、意图和交互建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

Conclusion: STG-Avatar框架成功解决了3DGS人体化身在非刚性变形和动态区域表示方面的挑战，为高保真可动画人体化身重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for
advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences.
While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still
struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction
quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics
while retaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our code is available at

Conclusion: LOC框架有效解决了3D场景理解中的开放集挑战，通过语言引导和密集对比学习实现了优异的性能，为3D视觉语言模型的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

Conclusion: ARFNet框架有效缓解了SFDA中的负迁移和域偏移问题，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source
domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the
source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information
and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have
shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate
on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede
enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing
this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network
(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and
domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual
fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are
exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture
the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention
features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to
achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and
self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local
representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,
which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and
intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to
evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised
self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the
source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the
efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying
scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other
techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有NeRF模型主要依赖物体中心采样，难以在媒体退化条件下保持3D空间的等距和各向同性度量感知。

Method: 提出反向分层上采样策略实现近均匀采样，建立统一的辐射传输公式将发射、吸收和散射统一到粒子模型中，基于Beer-Lambert衰减定律。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，相比现有方法，该方法显著提高了重建保真度和物理合理性。

Conclusion: I2-NeRF能够在水下、雾霾和低光等复杂媒体环境中实现等距和各向同性的度量感知，甚至可以估计水体深度等介质属性。

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: HARMONY框架通过联合利用多模态融合信息和输出概率分布，在视觉语言模型的不确定性估计方面建立了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,
VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and
InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or
better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and
6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for
VLMs.

Motivation: 尽管图像生成模型在规模和架构上取得了显著进展，但其机制仍然不透明。目标是剥离复杂的工程技巧，提出一个简单的非参数生成模型来理解自然图像的基本结构。

Method: 基于自然图像的三个原则设计模型：空间非平稳性、低层规律性和高层语义。每个像素的分布由其局部上下文窗口定义，无需训练，使用非参数方法。

Result: 在MNIST上产生高保真样本，在CIFAR-10上产生视觉上引人注目的图像。模型的白盒特性允许对泛化和多样性生成进行机制性理解。

Conclusion: 这种简单性与强经验性能的结合指向了自然图像结构的最小理论。模型揭示了"部分-整体泛化"的简单组合过程，为大型神经网络生成模型的泛化学习提供了假设。

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic
image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和模型在建筑环境轨迹预测方面表现出色，能够更好地捕捉复杂时空交互，为碰撞避免系统开发提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are
not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has
emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close
interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the
future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental
factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to
mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified
assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond
to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While
recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns,
they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for
the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and
DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory
prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as
the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles
in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique
IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.
TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3
m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both
workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m).
Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing
ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide
applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless,
existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D
motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first
framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian
Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach
generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in
both visual quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: GALA为多源主动领域自适应提供了简单有效的解决方案，显著减少标注成本的同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

Conclusion: UniPAN通过统一分布策略成功增强了全色锐化模型的泛化能力，实现了"一次训练，永久部署"的目标。

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

Motivation: 语义分割需要密集的像素级标注，成本高昂，特别是在标注预算极其有限的情况下。

Method: 两阶段选择流程：第一阶段使用MaxHerding进行分层表示候选选择，第二阶段计算熵增强分歧分数(eDALD)在多尺度扩散特征上选择最有信息量的像素。

Result: 在四个基准数据集(CamVid、ADE-Bed、Cityscapes、Pascal-Context)上的实验表明，该方法在极端像素预算下显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 通过解耦多样性和不确定性选择，仅用少量标注像素即可实现高分割精度。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决传统车道检测方法在复杂场景下特征表示能力不足的问题，通过扩散模型提升车道检测的泛化能力和准确性。

Conclusion: DiffusionLane具有强大的泛化能力和优异的检测性能，在多个基准测试中超越了现有最先进方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the
training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the
supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane,
Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong
generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18
surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain
adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets
81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and
97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer
vision, gaining particular importance in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving. The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while
operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we
present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation
leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained
Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The

enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were
applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip

Conclusion: 提出的新范式通过直接预测未来事故分数和精确的时间监督，显著改善了事故预测的可靠性和实用性，减少了误报问题。

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

Conclusion: GSAlign通过联合处理几何和语义对齐，有效解决了空中-地面行人重识别中的视角差异和遮挡问题，显著提升了匹配性能。

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet
challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically
different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to
extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and
ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view
representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and
spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and
Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces
two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic
misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)
Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps
pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively
compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In
parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that
highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the
negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view
correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching
protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant
improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous
state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and
satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for
achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this
task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem.
However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and
interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these
limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce
\textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban
\textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement
learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward
design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual
cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist
socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with
emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines,
improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban
contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators.
This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable
and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.

*Jing Wang,Jiajun Liang,Jie Liu,Henglin Liu,Gongye Liu,Jun Zheng,Wanyuan Pang,Ao Ma,Zhenyu Xie,Xintao Wang,Meng Wang,Pengfei Wan,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRPO-Guard通过重要性比率归一化和梯度重加权，解决了GRPO强化学习中重要性比率分布偏移问题，有效防止隐式过优化，提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO强化学习框架中，重要性比率分布存在系统性偏移（均值低于1、方差不一致），导致PPO裁剪机制无法有效约束过度自信的正向更新，造成隐式过优化问题。

Method: 提出GRPO-Guard方法：1）比率归一化恢复平衡且步长一致的重要性比率；2）梯度重加权策略均衡不同噪声条件下的策略梯度。

Result: 在多个扩散骨干模型（SD3.5M、Flux.1-dev）和多样化代理任务上的实验表明，GRPO-Guard显著减少过优化，同时保持甚至提升生成质量。

Conclusion: GRPO-Guard作为一种受调控的裁剪机制，能够稳定优化过程，显著缓解隐式过优化问题，且不依赖繁重的KL正则化。

Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in
optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with
task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on
importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative
gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the
importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs
substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution
prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing
the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a
result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization
stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as
image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making
the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we
introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO
frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a
balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping
properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a
gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,
preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these
designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and
substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL
regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,
SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard
significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving
generation quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将图论融入自监督表示学习的新方法，通过构建KNN图捕捉实例间关系，并使用GNN进行表示精炼，在多个数据集上实现了显著的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督学习方法主要关注通过数据增强产生的实例内变化，但往往忽略了重要的实例间关系。本文旨在同时保留实例内特性并捕捉实例间关系。

Method: 在预训练阶段为教师和学生流构建KNN图，节点表示样本及其潜在表示，边编码实例间相似度。预训练后进行表示精炼，使用GNN在多个跳数上传播消息以实现更广泛的上下文整合。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、ImageNet-100和ImageNet-1K数据集上分别实现了7.3%、3.2%和1.0%的准确率提升，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 基于图的机制在自监督表示学习中非常有效，能够显著提升模型性能，代码已公开可用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into
self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on
intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they
often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains
the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships
by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student
streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with
their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances.
Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this
phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate
neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual
integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MindHier是一个从粗到细的fMRI到图像重建框架，通过分层自回归建模解决了现有扩散方法中固定引导的问题，实现了更高效、认知对齐的图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的方法通常将fMRI活动映射到单个高级嵌入，并在整个生成过程中将其作为固定引导。这种固定引导会压缩分层神经信息，并且与图像重建的阶段需求不匹配。

Method: 提出了MindHier框架，包含三个组件：分层fMRI编码器提取多级神经嵌入，层次到层次对齐方案强制与CLIP特征的逐层对应，以及尺度感知的从粗到细神经引导策略在匹配尺度上将这些嵌入注入自回归过程。

Result: 在NSD数据集上的大量实验表明，MindHier实现了优于基于扩散的基线的语义保真度，推理速度快4.67倍，并且结果更具确定性。

Conclusion: MindHier通过实现分层重建过程，先合成全局语义再细化局部细节，类似于人类视觉感知，成为基于扩散方法的有效且认知对齐的替代方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

Abstract: Precise geometric control in image generation is essential for engineering \&
product design and creative industries to control 3D object features accurately
in image space. Traditional 3D editing approaches are time-consuming and demand
specialized skills, while current image-based generative methods lack accuracy
in geometric conditioning. To address these challenges, we propose
GeoDiffusion, a training-free framework for accurate and efficient geometric
conditioning of 3D features in image generation. GeoDiffusion employs a
class-specific 3D object as a geometric prior to define keypoints and
parametric correlations in 3D space. We ensure viewpoint consistency through a
rendered image of a reference 3D object, followed by style transfer to meet
user-defined appearance specifications. At the core of our framework is
GeoDrag, improving accuracy and speed of drag-based image editing on geometry
guidance tasks and general instructions on DragBench. Our results demonstrate
that GeoDiffusion enables precise geometric modifications across various
iterative design workflows.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了内窥镜手术中内参估计的挑战，为准确可靠的3D重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in
enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting
context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet
challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's
intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is
hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with
continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D
reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their
effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we
integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint
depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose
network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for
efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD
public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent
state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and
3D reconstruction. Code and model weights can be found in project repository:

Motivation: 现有噪声水印方法要么通过严格约束初始噪声采样实现强鲁棒性但降低用户体验，要么保持多样性但过于脆弱无法实际部署，需要解决这一平衡问题。

Method: 采用尾截断采样技术，仅在可靠的尾部区域嵌入水印位，同时随机采样中心区域以保持潜在分布；两阶段框架通过随机生成的会话密钥确保采样多样性。

Result: 在U-Net和DiT骨干的扩散模型上评估，T2SMark在鲁棒性和多样性之间实现了最优平衡。

Conclusion: T2SMark通过创新的尾截断采样和两阶段框架，成功解决了扩散模型水印中鲁棒性与多样性的权衡问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing
high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property
protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion
models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as
specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the
infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the
generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing
the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to
balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve
strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which
degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile
for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a
two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike
prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances
robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while
randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our
two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly
generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on
diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show
that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于循环相关的可变形图像配准框架，通过动态重定位匹配区域来高效处理大变形，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可变形图像配准中处理大变形时的效率问题。传统卷积网络缺乏直接的体素对应建模，而现有的体素到区域匹配方法由于局部性限制难以捕捉长距离对应关系。

Method: 采用循环相关框架，在每一步进行低成本局部匹配，通过估计的偏移量引导下一个搜索区域，逐步收敛到大变形。使用轻量级循环更新模块并解耦运动相关和纹理特征以减少语义冗余。

Result: 在脑部MRI和腹部CT数据集上的实验表明，该方法在精度和计算效率之间达到良好平衡。在非仿射OASIS数据集上达到与RDP相当的性能，但仅使用9.5%的FLOPs，运行速度快96%。

Conclusion: 所提出的循环相关框架能够高效处理大变形配准问题，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本，为医学图像配准提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between
images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical
imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

method supports diverse LiDAR types, including multiline 360 degree and

TL;DR: 提出TDSR框架，将图像描述重新定义为分层规划问题，通过高效的MCTS算法显著提升VLMs在细节描述、组合泛化和幻觉抑制方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图像描述中存在矛盾：强大的单步生成能力导致决策短视，难以在保持全局叙事连贯性的同时捕捉丰富细节。

Method: 将图像描述建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出Top-Down Semantic Refinement框架，采用视觉引导并行扩展和轻量级价值网络的高效MCTS算法，减少对昂贵VLM的调用频率。

Result: 在DetailCaps、COMPOSITIONCAP和POPE等多个基准测试中，TDSR作为即插即用模块显著提升了现有VLMs的性能，在细粒度描述、组合泛化和幻觉抑制方面达到最先进或极具竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: TDSR框架通过分层规划方法有效解决了VLMs在图像描述中的根本挑战，在保持高质量规划的同时大幅降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under
varying levels of snowfall

Result: 人类表现优于模型（93% vs 84%），更大模型表现更好但实用性仍有限（仅55%时间产生相关目标），相关模态信息能提升性能而无关模态影响较小。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在目标推断任务上仍有很大改进空间，多模态信息对性能提升有帮助，但距离实际应用还有差距。

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents
embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive
actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this
work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

Conclusion: 证明了半监督学习在利用未标记CryoET数据方面的潜力，能够显著提升粒子挑选性能。

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing
and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main
bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach
improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of
semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅验证了DynaPose4D框架的有效性，还表明其在计算机视觉和动画制作领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the
capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic
content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional
methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately
capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in
camera perspective. To address this issue, we propose DynaPose4D, an innovative
solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and
fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the
efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential
applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法需要多个教师网络来实现多样性，导致计算成本高昂。本文旨在通过单教师多分支的方式，以更低的成本获得多样化的教师视角。

Method: 为单个教师模型附加多个分支生成多视图，引入两个角度多样性目标：约束性角度间多样性损失（最大化视图间角度同时保持与原始教师输出的接近性）和角度内多样性损失（鼓励视图在原始输出周围均匀分布）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在不同配置下超越了现有的知识增强方法，并且能够以即插即用的方式与其他知识蒸馏框架兼容，持续提升泛化性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by
transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have
shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve
distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires
multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,
we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that
generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single
teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we
introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle
diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving
proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,
which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The
ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original
teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate
that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby
reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more
effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an
existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,
the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play
fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GateFuseNet，一种自适应3D多模态融合网络，整合QSM和T1w图像用于帕金森病诊断，通过门控融合模块学习模态特定注意力权重和通道门控向量进行选择性特征调制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于幅度的MRI模态（如T1w）对帕金森病病理敏感性不足，而定量磁化率成像（QSM）能更准确量化深部灰质核团中的铁沉积，但现有方法未能充分利用多模态信息。

Method: 开发自适应3D多模态融合网络GateFuseNet，包含门控融合模块，学习模态特定注意力权重和通道门控向量，通过分层门控机制增强ROI感知特征并抑制无关信号。

Result: 方法在三个现有最先进方法中表现最优，达到85.00%准确率和92.06% AUC。消融研究验证了ROI引导、多模态整合和融合定位的贡献。

Conclusion: GateFuseNet通过自适应多模态融合有效提升了帕金森病的MRI诊断性能，Grad-CAM可视化证实模型聚焦于临床相关病理区域。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) from MRI remains challenging
due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. Most existing
methods rely on conventional magnitude-based MRI modalities, such as
T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than
Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that
quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we
propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates
QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion
module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating
vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism
enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further
validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion
positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically
relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORIG是一个基于代理的开放多模态检索增强框架，用于事实图像生成，通过迭代检索和整合网络多模态证据来提升图像的事实一致性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型在生成逼真图像方面取得显著进展，但在涉及细粒度属性或时间敏感事件时经常产生与可验证知识相矛盾的输出。传统检索增强方法依赖静态来源和浅层证据整合，无法基于准确且不断演化的知识进行生成。

Method: ORIG框架迭代地从网络检索和过滤多模态证据，并逐步将精炼知识整合到增强提示中指导生成。

Result: 实验表明，ORIG在事实一致性和整体图像质量方面显著优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: ORIG展示了开放多模态检索在事实图像生成方面的潜力，通过动态知识整合有效解决了现有方法的事实准确性问题。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce
outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve
fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional
retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing
external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding
generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static
sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual
Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and
factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence
from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched
prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build
FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,
and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially
improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines,
highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image
generation.

TL;DR: AesCrop是一个基于美学驱动的图像裁剪模型，通过整合VMamba图像编码器和Transformer解码器，结合新颖的Mamba Composition Attention Bias机制，实现端到端的基于排名的图像裁剪，生成多个裁剪结果及其质量评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像裁剪方法在多样性和全局性方面存在不足，且缺乏摄影构图指导这一关键美学属性。AesCrop旨在通过显式编码构图线索来提升裁剪质量。

Method: 使用VMamba图像编码器，结合新颖的Mamba Composition Attention Bias机制和Transformer解码器，进行端到端的基于排名的图像裁剪。MCAB机制将构图线索显式编码到注意力机制中，引导模型关注构图最显著的区域。

Result: 大量实验表明，AesCrop在定量指标和定性视觉质量方面均优于当前最先进的方法，生成更令人愉悦的裁剪结果。

Conclusion: AesCrop通过整合构图感知的注意力偏置机制，成功提升了图像裁剪的美学质量，在多样性和全局性方面取得了平衡。

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

TL;DR: 提出Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG)方法，通过词组捕捉视觉词的空间共现和邻近关系构建在线词典，结合时间一致性改进相似度计算，在感知混淆环境中实现优越的闭环检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在感知混淆环境（如狭窄管道）中因向量量化、特征稀疏和重复纹理而表现不佳，现有解决方案通常计算成本高昂。

Method: 引入词组概念构建在线词典，结合概率转移模型的时间一致性自适应方案，加入特征分布分析模块和专用后验证机制。

Result: 在公共数据集和自建受限管道数据集上的实验表明，BoWG在精度-召回率和计算效率方面均优于现有方法，在Bicocca25b数据集上平均每张图像处理时间仅16毫秒。

Conclusion: BoWG方法在闭环检测中实现了优越的精度-召回率、鲁棒性和计算效率，并展现出优秀的可扩展性。

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the
Bicocca25b dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的即插即用空间重聚焦超分辨率框架，通过空间重聚焦交叉注意力和空间目标分类器自由引导机制，解决现有扩散超分辨率方法中的语义模糊和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的超分辨率方法存在语义模糊问题，主要源于文本条件的不准确和不完整，以及交叉注意力容易分散到无关像素的固有倾向，导致语义错位和幻觉细节。

Method: 提出SRSR框架，包含两个核心组件：1) 空间重聚焦交叉注意力，在推理时通过视觉基础分割掩码指导交叉注意力；2) 空间目标分类器自由引导机制，选择性绕过对未接地像素的文本影响以防止幻觉。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，SRSR在所有数据集的标准保真度指标上均优于七个最先进的基线方法，并在两个真实世界基准测试中在感知质量指标上表现更好。

Conclusion: SRSR框架在超分辨率任务中实现了高语义保真度和感知质量，有效解决了现有方法的语义模糊和幻觉问题。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution
(SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce
Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in
super-resolution.

### [112] [STATUS Bench: A Rigorous Benchmark for Evaluating Object State Understanding in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22571)
*Mahiro Ukai,Shuhei Kurita,Nakamasa Inoue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STATUS Bench是首个用于严格评估视觉语言模型理解物体状态细微变化能力的基准，包含三个同步任务：物体状态识别、图像检索和状态变化识别。实验表明当前最先进的VLMs在捕捉细微物体状态差异方面仍有困难，大多数开源模型在零样本设置下表现接近随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代视觉语言模型能够执行多种多模态任务，但它们在识别物体状态（如位置状态和功能状态）方面的精确度仍不明确。为了解决这个问题，需要建立一个专门的基准来严格评估VLMs理解物体状态细微变化的能力。

Method: 提出了STATUS Bench基准，包含三个同步评估任务：物体状态识别(OSI)、图像检索(IR)和状态变化识别(SCI)。构建了完全手工制作的数据集，包含图像对及其对应的物体状态描述和状态变化描述。同时创建了STATUS Train训练数据集，包含1300万个半自动生成的描述。

Result: 实验显示，在提出的严格评估方案下，大多数开源VLMs的零样本性能接近随机水平。在STATUS Train上微调后，Qwen2.5-VL达到了与Gemini 2.0 Flash相当的性能。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的VLMs在捕捉细微物体状态差异方面仍有显著困难，STATUS Bench和STATUS Train对于推进VLM研究中物体状态识别的发展具有必要性。

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level
zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved
performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the
necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in
VLM research.

Abstract: Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial
for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild
scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on
datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance
degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose
three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on
conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection
framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves
temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD

Motivation: 解决XLFM中基于学习的3D重建存在的两个核心挑战：缺乏标准化数据集和缺乏能有效建模角度-空间结构且保持物理基础的方法。

Method: 1) 构建XLFM-Zebrafish基准数据集；2) 提出自监督任务MVN-LF，通过预测遮挡视图学习角度先验；3) 设计可微分渲染约束ORC Loss，确保预测体积与PSF前向投影的一致性。

Conclusion: 该工作通过构建基准数据集、引入自监督学习和物理约束，显著提升了XLFM的3D重建性能，为神经科学大规模体内成像提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual
information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view
data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on
University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3
\times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS

Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training
framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that
rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to
learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions,
addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end,
PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student
networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented
images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce
novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout),
which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related
low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which
estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian
perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple
in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2
achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization
ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the
vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets,
highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The

Conclusion: PEDB通过将投影数据嵌入扩散桥模型，有效实现了数据一致性，显著提升了不完整CT数据重建的性能，在多种评估场景下均表现出色。

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet
neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from
hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images
are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,
distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent
symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a
self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input
wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second
stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the
input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns
the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss
function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need
for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for
optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is
incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the
magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember
coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps
during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract
endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with
different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark
hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several
state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,
quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a
resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact
network parameters for practical applications.

*Mackenzie Tapp,Sibi Chakravarthy Parivendan,Kashfia Sailunaz,Suresh Neethirajan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了跨物种迁移学习在奶牛姿态估计中的潜力与局限，发现尽管在分布内数据上表现良好，但在未见过的牛舍环境中泛化能力显著下降，揭示了合成到真实域差距是农业AI部署的主要障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业应用中缺乏大规模标注的牲畜数据集，特别是奶牛数据，限制了计算机视觉在动物姿态、行为理解方面的应用。

Method: 采用基于视觉变换器的ZebraPose模型，将其从合成斑马图像迁移到真实牛舍环境中的奶牛27关键点检测，使用三种配置（自定义农场数据集、APT-36K子集及其组合）系统评估模型准确性和泛化能力。

Result: 组合模型在分布内数据上表现良好（AP=0.86，AR=0.87，PCK 0.5=0.869），但在未见牛舍和牛群中泛化失败严重，表明物种间形态相似性不足以支持跨域迁移。

Conclusion: 合成到真实域差距是农业AI部署的主要障碍，需要农业优先的AI设计，优先考虑农场级真实性、跨环境鲁棒性和开放基准数据集。

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures are important biomarkers of tumor aggressiveness in
histopathology, yet reliable recognition remains challenging due to severe
class imbalance and variability across imaging domains. We present a
DenseNet-121-based framework tailored for atypical mitosis classification in
the MIDOG 2025 (Track 2) setting. Our method integrates stain-aware
augmentation (Macenko), geometric and intensity transformations, and
imbalance-aware learning via weighted sampling with a hybrid objective
combining class-weighted binary cross-entropy and focal loss. Trained
end-to-end with AdamW and evaluated across multiple independent domains, the
model demonstrates strong generalization under scanner and staining shifts,
achieving balanced accuracy 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and
specificity 80.9% on the official test set. These results indicate that
combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive
objectives yields a robust, domain-generalizable framework for atypical mitosis
classification suitable for real-world computational pathology workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种直接从预训练扩散模型参数中推导语义编辑方向的解析方法，无需额外数据或微调，通过计算自注意力权重矩阵的特征向量获得可解释的编辑方向，编辑时间减少60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成方面表现出色，但对其输出进行精确控制和目标编辑仍然具有挑战性。现有方法通常依赖大量图像采样或训练辅助网络，效率有限。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型的自注意力权重矩阵，通过计算其特征向量来直接推导语义编辑方向，无需额外数据或模型微调。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个数据集上产生高质量的编辑效果，同时将编辑时间显著减少了60%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效且可解释的方式来控制扩散模型的输出，通过分析模型内部参数直接获得语义编辑方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise
control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step
toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's
latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing
approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling
large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.
We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions
directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither
additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight
matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned
during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we
obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate
that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while
reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAR自监督学习和掩码图像建模方法主要关注低层视觉特征，忽略了多模态对齐和零样本目标识别能力，需要构建专门的视觉语言基础模型来提升SAR图像的语义理解。

Method: 构建SARCLIP-1M大规模数据集，采用对比视觉语言学习方法，通过领域迁移策略训练SARCLIP模型，实现SAR图像与文本描述的跨模态对齐。

Conclusion: SARCLIP成功建立了SAR图像与文本之间的语义桥梁，推进了SAR图像的语义理解，代码和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅SLAM方法通常依赖单一表示方案，在大规模动态室外场景中性能受限，导致累积位姿误差和尺度模糊问题。

Method: 提出分层协作表示模块（模仿人类思维链过程）和联合动态建模模块，融合开放世界分割与隐式残差约束，利用DINO-Depth特征的不确定性估计生成细粒度动态掩码。

Conclusion: LVD-GS系统通过LiDAR-视觉融合和分层协作表示，有效缓解了尺度漂移问题，增强了重建鲁棒性，并在动态场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Alias-Free ViT，通过无混叠下采样和线性交叉协方差注意力机制，解决ViT缺乏平移不变性的问题，在图像分类中保持竞争力并提升对抗平移的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers缺乏卷积网络的架构归纳偏置，特别是对图像平移不够鲁棒，而传统卷积网络由于下采样和非线性层的混叠效应也非完全平移不变。

Method: 结合两个主要组件：1）使用无混叠下采样和非线性层；2）采用线性交叉协方差注意力机制，该机制对整数和分数平移都具有平移等变性。

Result: 模型在图像分类任务中保持竞争力，在对抗平移鲁棒性方面优于相似规模的其他模型。

Conclusion: Alias-Free ViT通过消除混叠效应和使用平移等变注意力机制，有效提升了Vision Transformers的平移不变性，同时保持了良好的分类性能。

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision
tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may
hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs)
are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image
translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that
convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in
downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have
been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this
line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components.
First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses
linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and
fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our
model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms
similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高精地图预测方法存在任务不对齐问题，主要由于一对一匹配查询共享相同标签和任务共享采样机制导致次优特征，影响自动驾驶安全性

Method: DAMap包含三个组件：距离感知焦点损失(DAFL)为一对一匹配样本分配适当分类标签，任务调制可变形注意力(TMDA)获取区分性任务特定特征，混合损失方案(HLS)更好利用DAFL优势

Result: 在NuScenes和Argoverse2基准测试中，在不同指标、基线、分割、主干网络和训练计划下均实现性能提升

Conclusion: DAMap通过解决任务不对齐问题，有效提升了高精地图元素的分类和定位质量，为自动驾驶安全提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high
classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality
predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible
for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching
queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to
task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects
in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap
to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components:
Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated
Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate
classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to
obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed
to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments
and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2
benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and
schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

Method: 使用多任务学习模型从立面图像联合估计建造年份、建筑结构和物业类型，然后基于官方保险标准通过规则映射推导结构防火等级（H-非防火、T-半防火、M-防火）。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了基于图像的可扩展、可解释风险分析系统的可行性，在保险、城市规划和灾害准备方面具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and
insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction
year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the
second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban
planning, and disaster preparedness.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot
control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in
interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal
framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and
numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces
multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated
generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield
high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive
generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity
across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练免费方法使用固定长度时间窗口采样，难以准确捕捉不同时间跨度的异常，需要更灵活的采样策略。

Method: 利用预训练通用事件边界检测模型的知识构建分层粒度感知树，通过自适应粗-细分层结构和冗余去除来分解视频，然后注入多维先验到视觉语言模型中增强异常感知，最后使用大语言模型进行异常推理。

Result: 在三个挑战性数据集上的广泛实验表明，VADTree在训练免费设置下实现了最先进的性能，同时大幅减少了采样的视频片段数量。

Conclusion: VADTree通过分层粒度感知树结构和多模态模型的有效集成，在视频异常检测中取得了优异性能，为训练免费方法提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升生成质量17.07%，同时减少8.95%的检索次数

Conclusion: 所提出的动态检索策略和自适应训练方法有效解决了MRAG中的关键挑战，在提升生成质量的同时降低了计算开销

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote
sensing imagery.

### [133] [IGGT: Instance-Grounded Geometry Transformer for Semantic 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22706)
*Hao Li,Zhengyu Zou,Fangfu Liu,Xuanyang Zhang,Fangzhou Hong,Yukang Cao,Yushi Lan,Manyuan Zhang,Gang Yu,Dingwen Zhang,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT)，一个端到端的大型统一transformer，用于统一空间重建和实例级上下文理解的知识。通过3D一致性对比学习策略，仅使用2D视觉输入就能编码包含几何结构和实例聚类信息的统一表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多将3D重建和空间理解分开处理，忽略了这两个基本方面的关键相互作用，限制了泛化能力和下游3D理解任务的性能。最近的方法通过简单对齐3D模型与特定语言模型来缓解这个问题，但限制了感知能力和下游任务的适应性。

Method: 设计了3D一致性对比学习策略，指导IGGT仅通过2D视觉输入编码统一表示，该表示包含几何结构和实例聚类信息。还构建了InsScene-15K大规模数据集，包含高质量RGB图像、位姿、深度图和3D一致的实例级掩码标注。

Result: 该方法支持将2D视觉输入一致地提升为具有明确不同对象实例的连贯3D场景。

Conclusion: IGGT通过统一几何结构和实例级上下文理解，实现了更连贯和准确的3D场景理解，解决了现有方法中几何重建与语义理解分离的问题。

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data
curation pipeline.

Abstract: Lipreading has emerged as an increasingly important research area for
developing robust speech recognition systems and assistive technologies for the
hearing-impaired. However, non-English resources for visual speech recognition
remain limited. We introduce LRW-Persian, the largest in-the-wild Persian
word-level lipreading dataset, comprising $743$ target words and over
$414{,}000$ video samples extracted from more than $1{,}900$ hours of footage
across $67$ television programs. Designed as a benchmark-ready resource,
LRW-Persian provides speaker-disjoint training and test splits, wide regional
and dialectal coverage, and rich per-clip metadata including head pose, age,
and gender. To ensure large-scale data quality, we establish a fully automated
end-to-end curation pipeline encompassing transcription based on Automatic
Speech Recognition(ASR), active-speaker localization, quality filtering, and
pose/mask screening. We further fine-tune two widely used lipreading
architectures on LRW-Persian, establishing reference performance and
demonstrating the difficulty of Persian visual speech recognition. By filling a
critical gap in low-resource languages, LRW-Persian enables rigorous
benchmarking, supports cross-lingual transfer, and provides a foundation for
advancing multimodal speech research in underrepresented linguistic contexts.

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

TL;DR: 提出ConMatFormer混合深度学习架构，结合ConvNeXt块、多种注意力机制和Transformer模块，用于糖尿病足溃疡检测，在DFUC2021和DFU数据集上优于现有SOTA模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决糖尿病足溃疡检测中公开数据集稀缺和变异性的挑战，以及类别不平衡问题。

Method: 使用ConvNeXt块提取局部特征，结合CBAM和DANet注意力机制，集成Transformer模块增强长程依赖，并采用数据增强处理类别不平衡。

Result: 在单次实验中准确率达0.8961，精确率达0.9160；通过4折交叉验证准确率达0.9755，标准差仅0.0031，优于现有CNN和ViT模型。

Conclusion: ConMatFormer为糖尿病足溃疡分类设立了新基准，提供了医学图像分析的混合注意力Transformer框架，并通过XAI方法确保决策过程的透明度和可信度。

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

### [137] [Self-Calibrated Consistency can Fight Back for Adversarial Robustness in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22785)
*Jiaxiang Liu,Jiawei Du,Xiao Liu,Prayag Tiwari,Mingkun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC)方法，通过语义一致性和空间一致性模块增强CLIP模型在零样本设置下的对抗鲁棒性，无需对抗微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于对抗微调的防御方法在零样本场景下适用性有限，而CLIP等预训练视觉语言模型对对抗扰动高度脆弱，存在语义和视角脆弱性问题。

Method: SCC包含两个互补模块：语义一致性利用反攻击预热生成的软伪标签和多视图预测来正则化跨模态对齐；空间一致性通过增强视图对齐扰动后的视觉预测以稳定推理。

Result: 在22个基准测试和多种攻击设置下的广泛实验表明，SCC能持续提升CLIP的零样本鲁棒性，同时保持准确性，并可无缝集成到其他VLM中。

Conclusion: SCC展示了从CLIP建立对抗鲁棒范式的巨大潜力，其影响可扩展到更广泛的视觉语言领域如BioMedCLIP。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学VQA系统需要透明推理才能获得临床信任，现有系统缺乏足够的可解释性来支持医生诊断决策。

Method: 使用微调BLIP-2骨干网络，结合医学查询重构、增强Grad-CAM注意力、精确区域提取和多模态语言模型的链式思维推理。

Result: 在500个PathVQA样本上，综合得分从基线的0.378提升到0.683，识别3-5个诊断相关区域，生成平均57词的结构化解释，推理置信度达0.890。

Conclusion: MedXplain-VQA展示了作为稳健可解释医学VQA系统的潜力，查询重构贡献最大改进，链式思维推理实现系统性诊断过程。

Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual
question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning
to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive
framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable
medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone,
medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region
extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language
models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific
framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant
assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and
attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples
demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a
composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while
maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5
diagnostically relevant regions per sample and generates structured
explanations averaging 57 words with appropriate clinical terminology. Ablation
studies reveal that query reformulation provides the most significant initial
improvement, while chain-of-thought reasoning enables systematic diagnostic
processes. These findings underscore the potential of MedXplain-VQA as a
robust, explainable medical VQA system. Future work will focus on validation
with medical experts and large-scale clinical datasets to ensure clinical
readiness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC-Talk是一个基于扩散模型的单次学习框架，用于生成可定制且时间稳定的说话人脸视频，解决了现有方法在时间一致性、身份保持和定制化方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频驱动说话人脸生成方法虽然改善了音频-嘴唇同步，但在时间一致性、身份保持和定制化方面存在困难，特别是在生成长视频时。

Method: MAGIC-Talk包含ReferenceNet（用于保持身份并通过文本提示实现细粒度面部编辑）和AnimateNet（使用结构化运动先验增强运动连贯性），并引入了渐进潜在融合策略来改善长视频质量。

Result: 大量实验表明，MAGIC-Talk在视觉质量、身份保持和同步准确性方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC-Talk为说话人脸生成提供了一个强大的解决方案，能够从单张图像保持身份，同时确保帧间平滑过渡。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve
audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency,
identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation.
To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based
framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation.
MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve
long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy,
offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

*Zahraa Al Sahili,Maryam Fetanat,Maimuna Nowaz,Ioannis Patras,Matthew Purver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairJudge是一个轻量级评估协议，使用指令跟随的多模态LLM作为公平评判者，通过解释导向的评分标准评估文本到图像系统生成图像与提示的匹配度和社会属性处理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像系统评估方法（如面部分类器和对比相似度）存在缺陷：奖励表面线索、缺乏校准弃权机制、无法评估弱可见属性（如宗教、文化、残疾）。需要更可靠、可复现的公平性审计方法。

Method: FairJudge协议将多模态LLM作为公平评判者，使用[-1,1]区间的解释导向评分标准，约束判断为封闭标签集，要求基于可见内容的证据，并在线索不足时强制弃权。

Result: 在FairFace、PaTA、FairCoT等数据集上评估性别、种族、年龄等属性，并扩展到宗教、文化和残疾。在IdenProf、FairCoT-Professions和新发布的DIVERSIFY-Professions上评估职业正确性和对齐度。评判模型在人口统计预测和平均对齐度方面优于对比和面部中心基线，同时保持高职业准确性。

Conclusion: FairJudge能够实现更可靠、可复现的公平性审计，为文本到图像系统提供问责制、基于证据的决策，而不需要改变生成器本身。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

Result: 基于LLM的系统在最终测试集上表现出比梯度提升树基线更好的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的多模态融合方法在商业广告记忆度预测任务中具有优势，能够有效整合视觉和文本信息并提高预测性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as
part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability:
Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025
workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM
backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SP-CSVR框架来解决大视觉语言模型中的"风格陷阱"问题，通过风格-内容解耦和语义对齐机制，实现在多样化视觉风格下的稳定语义理解和跨风格视觉推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在多样化视觉风格下存在"风格陷阱"问题，特别是在上下文学习中，现有方法难以有效解耦风格与内容，阻碍了模型的泛化能力。

Method: SP-CSVR框架包含三个核心组件：跨风格特征编码器（CSFE）用于风格-内容解耦，语义对齐上下文解码器（SAICD）用于少样本风格适应，自适应语义一致性模块（ASCM）通过多任务对比学习强制跨风格语义不变性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多风格数据集上的广泛实验表明，SP-CSVR在视觉描述、视觉问答和上下文风格适应方面达到了最先进的性能。消融研究和泛化分析证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: SP-CSVR通过增强鲁棒性、泛化能力和效率，有效解决了大视觉语言模型在多样化视觉风格下的语义理解问题。

Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual
styles, especially in in-context learning (ICL). Existing methods often fail to
effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address
this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR),
a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style
visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for
style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD)
for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency
Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style
semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset
demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning,
visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive
evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm
SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency
across diverse visual styles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联合图像对齐方法通常需要长时间训练、大容量模型和大量超参数调优，计算复杂度高。

Method: 利用现成图像匹配器计算成对匹配，通过快速非参数聚类构建关键点关系图，使用图神经网络传播和聚合对应关系，通过图像级池化预测单应性参数，采用逆组合损失消除正则化项需求。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，FastJAM在配准质量上优于现有现代JA方法，同时将计算时间从数小时或数分钟减少到仅几秒钟。

Conclusion: FastJAM提供了一种快速有效的联合图像对齐解决方案，显著降低了计算复杂度，无需正则化项和相关超参数调优。

Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a
unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at
corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long
training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We
introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the
computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise
matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid
nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and
inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and
aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography
parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,
that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted
transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated
with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves
results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,
while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code
is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型的概念擦除方法往往会损害生成质量，需要一种既能有效擦除有害内容又能保持图像质量的方法。

Method: 在扩散过程前直接操作文本嵌入，动态估计提示中目标概念的存在，执行校准的向量减法来中和概念影响。包含共现编码模块用于多概念擦除，以及视觉反馈循环处理潜在概念持续性问题。

Result: 在物体、显式内容、艺术风格和多名人擦除任务中显著优于现有方法，达到93.58 H-score的物体擦除效果，将显式内容减少到仅1个实例，风格擦除H_a为8.09且无质量下降。

Conclusion: Semantic Surgery提供了一个实用的解决方案，既能作为内置威胁检测系统，又能确保更安全的文本到图像生成，同时保持图像质量。

Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating
harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We
introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for
concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion
process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt
and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at
the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework
includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a
visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free
method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise
interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic
style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and
robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in
object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in
style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our
framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a
practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: 提出基于RAG和视觉语言模型的零样本风电叶片损伤检测框架，无需任务特定训练即可准确分类多种损伤类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电叶片在恶劣环境中运行，需要及时检测损伤以防止故障。现有基于无人机和深度学习的方法依赖大量标注数据，难以检测罕见或新型损伤。

Method: 构建包含技术文档、参考图像和领域指南的多模态知识库，使用混合文本-图像检索器结合关键词重排序，为VLM提供相关上下文进行推理。

Result: 在30张叶片图像测试集上，RAG增强的VLM正确分类所有样本，性能优于无检索的VLM和开放词汇基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架提供数据高效的工业检测解决方案，通过可解释性和泛化性减少对大量标注数据的依赖，能够检测未见过的缺陷类型。

Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage
detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance.
Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on
large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving
damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection
framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed,
comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and
domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware
reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at
inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We
evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage
categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring
verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this
test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the
same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We
further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting.
Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in
explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning
process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging
domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research
contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces
dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估算牧草生物量对于畜牧业生产系统的决策制定至关重要，可以优化放牧率，减少过度放牧风险，促进系统健康。

Method: 收集了澳大利亚19个地点的牧场俯视图，包含多个季节和温带牧草物种，每张图像对应70cm×30cm样方，并配有地面测量数据（生物量组分、植被高度、NDVI等）。

Result: 创建了一个多维数据集，结合了视觉、光谱和结构信息，为精准放牧管理提供了新的可能性，并在Kaggle平台上发布了数据集和竞赛。

Conclusion: 该数据集为机器学习社区提供了牧草生物量估算的挑战机会，有助于推动精准畜牧业的发展。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in
livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to
manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the
risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a
comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected
across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons
and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm *
30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted
by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors
(AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual,
spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing
the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in
a Kaggle competition that challenges the international Machine Learning
community with the task of pasture biomass estimation. The dataset is available

*Pranav Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-LangSplat通过使用预训练的通用自编码器替代场景特定的语言自编码器，消除了3D语言场构建中的场景特定训练瓶颈，实现了效率提升和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如LangSplat需要为每个场景训练特定的语言自编码器进行特征压缩，这造成了昂贵的逐场景优化瓶颈，限制了部署的可扩展性。

Method: 使用在ScanNet数据集上预训练的通用自编码器，为任何新场景提供固定的紧凑潜在空间，无需场景特定训练。通过消融研究确定了最佳潜在嵌入维度。

Result: 整个语言场构建过程实现了效率提升，查询性能与原LangSplat方法相当或更优。使用MSE和余弦相似度验证了512维CLIP嵌入的表示保真度。

Conclusion: 通用嵌入能够高效准确地支持新3D场景中的开放词汇查询，为可扩展的实时交互3D AI应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive
human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.
State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled
from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently
offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for
feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck
that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,
that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a
generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet
dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent
space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific
training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction
process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance
comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our
design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the
optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity
using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and
reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that
generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary
querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive
3D AI applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了位置保持嵌入(PPE)方法，在视觉令牌压缩过程中保持时空结构，通过解耦编码3D位置信息，使压缩令牌能够封装来自多个原始令牌的不同位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但由于冗余视觉令牌导致效率低下。现有令牌合并方法减少序列长度但经常破坏空间布局和时间连续性，忽视了位置关系。

Method: PPE在令牌维度显式引入解耦的3D位置编码，使每个压缩令牌能够封装来自多个原始令牌的不同位置。支持级联聚类策略，实现渐进式令牌压缩。

Result: 应用于最先进的令牌合并框架，在多个视觉语言基准测试中实现2%~5%的持续改进，包括MMBench(通用视觉理解)、TextVQA(布局理解)和VideoMME(时间理解)。

Conclusion: 保持位置线索对于高效有效的MLLM推理至关重要，PPE作为参数无关的通用算子可以无缝集成到现有令牌合并方法中。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant
visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but
frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding
positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator
dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding
(\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal
structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the
disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each
compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original
tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade
clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better
performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any
adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves
consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language
benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout
understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate
that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM
reasoning.

TL;DR: 本研究通过训练双编码器网络测试生物特征统计独立性的假设，发现左右虹膜具有相关性，指纹模型重现了先前研究的正相关结果，但跨模态匹配效果仅略高于随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统认为个体生物特征统计独立的假设，验证不同生物特征之间是否存在相关性。

Method: 使用ResNet-50和Vision Transformer作为骨干网络，在双编码器架构中训练对比损失，对274名受试者的约10万张指纹和7千张虹膜图像进行三个验证任务：指纹-指纹匹配、虹膜-虹膜匹配和跨模态指纹-虹膜匹配。

Result: 虹膜ResNet架构在虹膜-虹膜匹配中达到91% ROC AUC得分，证明个体左右虹膜具有相关性；指纹模型重现了先前研究的正相关结果；跨模态匹配仅略高于随机水平。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了生物特征独立性的假设，未来计划扩展到其他生物特征，需要更多数据和更复杂的流程来获得有说服力的跨模态匹配结果。

Abstract: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are
statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder
networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint
matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching
using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained
ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such
that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is
minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for
iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises
of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive
intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work
attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching
rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more
sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings
continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend
this work to other biometrics in the future. Code available:

TL;DR: 提出了一种可切换的令牌特定码本量化方法，用于人脸图像压缩，通过为不同图像类别学习不同的码本组，并为每个令牌分配独立码本，在低比特率下提升重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于码本的解决方案使用全局共享码本，但忽略了人脸图像中类别特定的相关性以及令牌间的语义差异，导致在低比特率下性能不佳。

Method: 学习不同图像类别的码本组，为每个令牌分配独立码本，通过少量比特记录每个令牌所属的码本组，在降低每个码本组大小的同时减少损失。

Result: 在0.05 bpp下，重建图像的平均识别准确率达到93.51%。

Conclusion: 该方法可集成到任何现有的基于码本的表征学习方法中，在低比特率下显著提升人脸图像的重建性能。

Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的免训练视频编辑模型在处理职业相关提示时倾向于依赖性别刻板印象，存在性别偏见问题。

Method: 通过软注入去偏标记到文本编码器获得公平嵌入，同时在时间自注意力和提示到区域交叉注意力中集成公平调制，使用区域约束注意力掩码和时间衰减权重来增强一致性。

Result: 在FairVE基准测试中，FAME实现了更强的公平对齐和语义保真度，超越了现有的视频编辑基线方法。

Conclusion: FAME通过公平感知的注意力调制有效减轻了视频编辑中的性别偏见，同时保持了良好的时间一致性和语义保真度。

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender
stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME}
for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates
profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal
consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing
minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text
encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal
self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion
corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness
cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained
attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region
coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross
attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating
fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings.
Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right
visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments
on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME
achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing
VE baselines.

Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型虽然能力显著提升，但大多需要从头训练且计算资源消耗巨大。本文旨在通过战略性地融合公开可用的专用模型，以更高效的方式获得竞争性性能。

Method: 保留原始生成和理解模型的块结构，同时在网络中交错插入多模态自注意力块，实现双重融合机制，既保留基础模型优势，又促进高层次语义表征与低层次空间信号的协同融合。

Result: 在仅使用约35B token训练后，在多个基准测试中表现强劲：GenEval组合文本到图像生成0.91，DPG-Bench复杂文本到图像生成82.16，GEditBench 6.06，ImgEdit-Bench图像编辑3.77。

Conclusion: 通过战略融合现有模型而非从头训练，能够以更高效的方式实现竞争性多模态性能，为统一多模态建模的未来研究提供支持。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both
capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from
scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show
that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by
strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either
generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks
while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the
networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal
fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and
(2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from
the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation
encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong
results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional
text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image
generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By
fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope
to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归模型在图像生成中计算密集，且VAR等解决方案样本多样性有限，需要更高效的生成方法。

Method: 采用嵌套自回归架构，设计分层多尺度模块，每个模块内部使用AR结构生成token块，并结合流匹配损失和连续token。

Result: NestAR在保持竞争力的图像生成性能的同时，显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 嵌套自回归架构是解决自回归模型计算复杂度和多样性问题的有效方法。

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image
generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However,
their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally
intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample
diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model,
which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR
designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled
modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is
conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each
module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The
proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as
well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching
loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these
multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image
generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

Motivation: 传统的固定补丁大小采样方法在3D医学图像分割中存在类别不平衡问题，且训练效率不高。本文旨在通过动态调整补丁大小来优化训练过程。

Method: 采用渐进式补丁大小增长策略，在模型训练过程中逐步增加输入补丁的尺寸。评估了两种模式：资源高效模式和性能模式。

Result: 资源高效模式将训练时间减少到基准方法的44%，同时保持相同的Dice分数性能；性能模式在15个任务中均超越基准方法，平均Dice分数相对提升1.28%，训练时间减少到89%。

Conclusion: 这种简单而优雅的输入数据变换策略显著提高了分割性能和训练效率，且适用于多种分割架构（UNet、UNETR、SwinUNETR），是一种广泛适用的优化方法。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic
curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach
progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an
improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of
the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a
resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score
performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score
performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a
notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves
upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically
significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,
across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the
constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously
reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced
for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean
segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more
trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the
proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but
represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance
across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In
summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data
substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while
being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With
powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align
naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal
characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the
field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a
dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of
multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual
and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics
and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques
for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality
heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training
paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are
systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks.
Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across
ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and
application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping,
agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial
intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline
pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and
privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.

Motivation: 现有多视角3D重建方法依赖输入视图间的充分重叠，但在实践中经常因遮挡和稀疏覆盖导致严重的不完整重建。扩散式3D生成技术虽能通过生成先验补全不可见部分，但其随机性限制了结果的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 分析扩散式3D生成方法一致性不足的原因：(a)提取多视角图像特征时构建和利用跨视角连接的不足；(b)迭代去噪过程中局部细节生成的不可控性。提出ReconViaGen，将重建先验整合到生成框架中，并设计多种策略解决这些问题。

Conclusion: ReconViaGen成功解决了多视角3D重建中的完整性问题，通过整合重建先验到生成框架，实现了与输入视图一致的高质量3D重建。

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
global structure and local details.Project page:

Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式帧选择来保持DDIM反演的时间一致性，这会引入人为偏差并降低端到端推理的可扩展性。

Method: 提出变分对齐模块，通过对比学习目标学习有意义的分配，将跨帧潜在表示压缩为保持内容和时间一致性的潜在锚点。

Conclusion: VALA能够完全集成到无需训练的文本到图像视频编辑模型中，提供自适应关键帧选择和语义锚点压缩，实现高质量的视频编辑。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and
precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame
selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which
introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In
this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment
for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that
adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into
semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments,
VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective.
Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed
latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method
can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing
models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that
VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing
quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over

Abstract: This thesis works to address a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis:
the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are often limited due to the
need for expert annotation and constrained by privacy and legal issues. By
focusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain
adaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations,
presenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep
learning in medical imaging.
  Central to this thesis is the development of the Medformer, an innovative
neural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain
adaptation. This model is adept at pre-training on diverse medical image
datasets, handling varying sizes and modalities, and is equipped with a dynamic
input-output adaptation mechanism. This enables efficient processing and
integration of a wide range of medical image types, from 2D X-rays to complex
3D MRIs, thus mitigating the dependency on large labeled datasets.
  Further, the thesis explores the current state of self-supervised learning in
medical imaging. It introduces novel pretext tasks that are capable of
extracting meaningful information from unlabeled data, significantly advancing
the model's interpretative abilities. This approach is validated through
rigorous experimentation, including the use of the MedMNIST dataset,
demonstrating the model's proficiency in learning generalized features
applicable to various downstream tasks.
  In summary, this thesis contributes to the advancement of medical image
analysis by offering a scalable, adaptable framework that reduces reliance on
labeled data. It paves the way for more accurate, efficient diagnostic tools in
healthcare, signifying a major step forward in the application of deep learning
in medical imaging.

TL;DR: 提出了UniScene框架，基于Nuplan-Occ数据集联合生成高质量语义占据、多视角视频和LiDAR点云，通过时空解耦架构和模态桥接技术实现4D动态占据的逼真生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有占据中心方法对标注占据数据的依赖问题，Nuplan-Occ数据稀缺限制了生成性能，需要更大规模数据集支持自动驾驶下游应用。

Method: 使用时空解耦架构支持高保真空间扩展和时间预测；提出基于高斯溅射的稀疏点图渲染策略增强多视角视频生成；采用传感器感知嵌入策略显式建模LiDAR传感器特性。

Result: 在广泛实验中证明该方法相比现有方法具有更优的生成保真度和可扩展性，并在下游任务中验证了实用价值。

Conclusion: UniScene框架通过统一占据中心的驾驶场景生成方法，成功解决了多模态数据生成问题，为自动驾驶感知和规划评估提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving,
enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation.
Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
in downstream tasks. Repo:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FRBNet，一种基于频域通道比率的端到端可训练模块，通过结构化滤波过程提取光照不变特征，显著提升低光条件下目标检测和分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光视觉中严重光照退化问题，现有方法对低光条件建模不完整，影响下游任务性能。

Method: 扩展经典Lambertian模型，在频域分析中利用频域通道比率提取光照不变特征，提出FRBNet模块集成可学习频域滤波器。

Result: 在多个下游任务中表现优异，暗光目标检测mAP提升2.2，夜间分割mIoU提升2.9。

Conclusion: FRBNet作为即插即用模块能有效增强光照不变特征，无需修改损失函数即可集成到现有网络中。

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
\textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet
achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and
+2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoMP是一种前馈方法，通过多视图特征和几何变换器预测3D物体的体积材料属性（杨氏模量、泊松比、密度），在物理模拟中实现自动材料属性分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理模拟通常需要手工制作空间变化的机械属性，过程繁琐耗时。VoMP旨在自动预测3D物体的体积材料属性，减少人工干预。

Method: 使用多视图特征聚合和几何变换器预测每个体素的材料潜在编码，这些编码位于从真实世界数据集学习的物理可行材料流形上。提出结合分割3D数据集、材料数据库和视觉语言模型的标注流程。

Result: VoMP在准确性和速度上都显著优于现有方法，能够准确估计体积材料属性。

Conclusion: VoMP提供了一种有效的自动材料属性预测方法，在物理模拟中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often
laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict
Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout
the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and
voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our
trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These
latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn
from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel
materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation
pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases,
and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that
VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in
accuracy and speed.

### [162] [On the Faithfulness of Visual Thinking: Measurement and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23482)
*Zujing Liu,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Yuan Gao,Guisong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文发现大型视觉语言模型生成的视觉-文本多模态思维链存在视觉信息不准确的问题，提出了自动化评估指标来衡量视觉线索的忠实性，并提出了SCCM学习策略来改进视觉忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs生成的MCoT推理过程中视觉信息经常不准确但仍能得出正确答案，表明推理过程缺乏忠实性。这源于RFT中的RL奖励只激励视觉-文本交替格式，而不考虑视觉信息的正确性。

Method: 提出SCCM学习策略，鼓励MCoT生成足够但最小的视觉组件，这些组件能够独立导致正确答案。该方法无需标注，可与各种RFT即插即用。

Result: 经验结果表明，SCCM在一系列细粒度感知和推理基准测试中持续提高了视觉忠实性。

Conclusion: SCCM方法有效解决了MCoT中视觉信息不忠实的问题，提高了多模态推理的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text
multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is
often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of
faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to
the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved
vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information
into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual
information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by
measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts
are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged
under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,
indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze
visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that
quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability
and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current
MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this
issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component
Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate
sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of
leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free
and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical
results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness
across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is
available at https://github.com/EugeneLiu01/Faithful_Thinking_with_Image.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在概念一致性方面存在局限，特别是忽视了场景在故事叙述中的关键作用，限制了实际应用中的创造力。

Method: 提出训练免费的SceneDecorator框架，包含VLM引导的场景规划（确保叙事连贯性）和长期场景共享注意力机制（维持场景一致性）。

Result: 大量实验证明SceneDecorator在场景一致性和叙事连贯性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SceneDecorator有潜力在艺术、电影和游戏领域释放创造力，推动场景导向的故事生成发展。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they
still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images.
While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the
crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in
practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two
key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure
scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and
(ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of
maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose
SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene
Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a
``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain
long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,
highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,
and games.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIRE是一种新颖的主题驱动3D/4D生成方法，通过跟踪、修复和重投影三个步骤，在保持3D一致性的同时显著提升了语义身份保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D/4D生成方法虽然注重真实感、效率和美观，但往往无法在不同视角下保持主题的语义身份。主题驱动的个性化生成方法能够生成与主题身份对齐的视觉内容，但这一领域仍待深入探索。

Method: TIRE方法：1）使用现有3D生成模型生成初始3D资产；2）通过视频跟踪识别需要修改的区域；3）采用主题驱动的2D修复模型逐步填充识别区域；4）将修改后的2D多视角观察重投影回3D，同时保持一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，与最先进方法相比，TIRE方法在3D/4D生成中的身份保留能力显著提升。

Conclusion: TIRE通过创新的跟踪-修复-重投影流程，有效解决了3D/4D生成中的身份保留问题，为个性化3D/4D生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

### [165] [LoMix: Learnable Weighted Multi-Scale Logits Mixing for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22995)
*Md Mostafijur Rahman,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoMix是一种可微分即插即用模块，通过混合多尺度解码器logits来生成新的混合尺度输出，并学习如何指导训练过程，在U型网络中实现零推理开销的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: U型网络在不同空间尺度输出logits，但传统训练方法要么只监督最终高分辨率logits，要么对所有尺度应用相同的损失权重，未能探索混合尺度组合的互补线索。

Method: 使用四种轻量级融合算子（加法、乘法、拼接和基于注意力的加权融合）混合多尺度解码器logits，生成丰富的合成突变图，并通过softplus损失权重与网络参数共同优化。

Result: 在Synapse 8器官数据集上，相比单输出监督提升DICE +4.2%，比深度监督提升+2.2%，比等权重加法融合提升+1.5%。在数据稀缺情况下优势更明显（+9.23%）。

Conclusion: LoMix通过可学习的加权混合尺度融合，在保持数据效率、完全可解释性和零推理开销的同时，实现了广泛泛化性能提升。

Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a
different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats
these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final,
highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss
weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations.
Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only
when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce
LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that
generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should
guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder
logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication,
concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of
synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss
weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step
architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales,
mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures
(i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset
improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep
supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero
inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled
scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency.
Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up
to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted
mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully
interpretable, and overhead-free at inference. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SLDGroup/LoMix.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMo是一个用于文本到视频生成中组合运动定制的新框架，能够在一个视频中合成多个不同的运动，解决了现有方法在复杂多主体运动控制方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频模型在生成多样化场景方面表现出色，但在精确运动控制方面存在困难，特别是在处理复杂多主体运动时。现有的单运动定制方法在组合场景中失败，主要由于运动-外观纠缠和无效的多运动融合两个挑战。

Method: CoMo采用两阶段方法：1）单运动学习阶段，通过静态-动态解耦调优范式将运动与外观分离，学习运动特定模块；2）多运动组合阶段，通过即插即用的分治策略，在去噪过程中空间隔离不同运动的影响来组合学习到的运动，无需额外训练。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，CoMo实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了可控视频生成的能力。作者还引入了新的基准测试和评估指标来评估多运动保真度和融合效果。

Conclusion: CoMo框架通过解耦运动与外观、采用分治组合策略，成功解决了文本到视频生成中的组合运动定制问题，为可控视频生成开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
$\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate
research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel
evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video
generation. Our project page is at https://como6.github.io/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了统一的几何和属性增强框架UGAE，通过后几何增强、前属性增强和后属性增强三个核心组件，显著提升了点云压缩的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云的有损压缩会不可避免地导致几何结构和属性信息的不可逆失真，需要一种方法来减少这些失真并提高压缩质量。

Method: UGAE框架包含三个组件：基于Transformer的稀疏卷积U-Net进行几何重建、增强几何引导的重新着色策略进行属性预处理、属性残差预测网络进行后处理。

Result: 在8iVFB、Owlii和MVUB三个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，相比G-PCC测试模型，几何BD-PSNR提升9.98dB，属性BD-PSNR提升3.67dB，同时大幅节省比特率。

Conclusion: UGAE框架有效解决了点云压缩中的几何和属性失真问题，在保持高压缩效率的同时显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs;
however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure
and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified
geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three
core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement
(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based
sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with
high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the
refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced
geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest
Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively
preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the
decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a
weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of
high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.
UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:
8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29),
UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings
for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with
56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it
improved perceptual quality significantly.

TL;DR: 提出了M³T2IBench基准和AlignScore评估指标，用于评估文本到图像模型在多类别、多实例、多关系场景下的图像-文本对齐能力，并提出了Revise-Then-Enforce方法来提升对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在生成与文本提示完美对齐的图像方面存在困难，且现有评估方法要么过于简单，要么评估指标与人类评价相关性差，特别是忽略了同一类别下多个不同实例的复杂提示场景。

Method: 提出了M³T2IBench大规模基准数据集，包含多类别、多实例、多关系场景；开发了基于目标检测的AlignScore评估指标；提出了训练无关的Revise-Then-Enforce后编辑方法来增强图像-文本对齐。

Result: 当前开源文本到图像模型在这个具有挑战性的基准上表现不佳；提出的Revise-Then-Enforce方法在广泛的扩散模型中都能提升图像-文本对齐效果。

Conclusion: M³T2IBench基准和AlignScore指标能有效评估复杂场景下的图像-文本对齐，Revise-Then-Enforce方法为提升文本到图像生成的对齐质量提供了有效的训练无关解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that
perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on
evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these
evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the
difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same
category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human
evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,
multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an
object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely
with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source
text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.
Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text
alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in
image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our
code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of image generative models, the authenticity of
digital images has become a significant concern. While existing studies have
proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks
are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image
categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To
address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive
benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers
a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image,
image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer
three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the

TL;DR: HieraMamba是一个用于视频时序定位的分层架构，通过Anchor-MambaPooling块和多粒度对比学习，在长视频中实现精确的时间定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时，由于过度下采样或依赖固定窗口，往往会牺牲时间保真度。需要一种能同时捕捉全局上下文和细粒度时间细节的解决方案。

Method: 采用分层架构，核心是Anchor-MambaPooling块，利用Mamba的选择性扫描生成多粒度的紧凑锚点标记。结合锚点条件和片段池化对比损失来保持局部细节和全局区分性。

Result: 在Ego4D-NLQ、MAD和TACoS数据集上达到了新的最先进水平，证明了在长未修剪视频中实现精确、时间忠实定位的能力。

Conclusion: HieraMamba通过分层设计和多粒度表示，有效解决了长视频时序定位中的时间保真度问题，为视频理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a
natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global
context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal
fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present
HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and
semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP)
blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor
tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two
complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive
losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally
discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and
TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习配准方法在训练数据分布外的泛化能力较差，限制了其实际应用。LUMIR脑配准挑战赛旨在评估不同对比度和模态下的配准性能。

Method: 将图像转换到MIND特征空间后再输入模型，并提出特殊的集成策略

Result: 该方法显著提高了鲁棒性，集成策略带来了小而一致的改进

Conclusion: 简单的MIND特征空间转换和集成策略能有效提升深度学习配准方法的泛化能力

Abstract: Deep learning based deformable registration methods have become popular in
recent years. However, their ability to generalize beyond training data
distribution can be poor, significantly hindering their usability. LUMIR brain
registration challenge for Learn2Reg 2025 aims to advance the field by
evaluating the performance of the registration on contrasts and modalities
different from those included in the training set. Here we describe our
submission to the challenge, which proposes a very simple idea for
significantly improving robustness by transforming the images into MIND feature
space before feeding them into the model. In addition, a special ensembling
strategy is proposed that shows a small but consistent improvement.

TL;DR: EndoWave是一种用于内窥镜视频3D重建的统一时空高斯泼溅框架，通过结合光流几何约束和多分辨率有理小波监督来解决内窥镜场景中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人辅助微创手术中，从内窥镜视频进行准确的3D重建对下游任务和改善手术结果至关重要。但内窥镜场景存在光度不一致、非刚性组织运动和视角相关高光等独特挑战，仅依赖外观约束的3DGS方法往往不足。

Method: 1. 采用统一的时空高斯表示，直接在4D域中优化基元；2. 提出基于光流的几何约束来增强时间一致性并有效约束场景的3D结构；3. 提出多分辨率有理正交小波作为约束，能有效分离内窥镜细节并增强渲染性能。

Result: 在两个真实手术数据集EndoNeRF和StereoMIS上的广泛评估表明，EndoWave相比基线方法实现了最先进的重建质量和视觉精度。

Conclusion: EndoWave通过结合几何约束和小波监督，有效解决了内窥镜3D重建中的动态视觉伪影问题，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

Motivation: 多模态位置编码对视觉语言模型至关重要，但目前缺乏系统性的研究。论文旨在全面分析多模态RoPE的核心组件，为多模态位置编码提供理论基础和实践指导。

Method: 通过分析RoPE的两个核心组件（位置设计和频率分配），提出了三种关键指导原则，并基于这些原则开发了MHRoPE和MRoPE-I两种变体方法，这些方法无需改变模型架构即可直接应用。

Result: 提出的方法在多个基准测试中一致优于现有方法，在通用和细粒度多模态理解任务上都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet
there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position
encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and
frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key
guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation
of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and
faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose
Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and
plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods
consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with
significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal
understanding. Code will be avaliable at

TL;DR: 提出了残差扩散桥模型（RDBM），通过理论推导广义扩散桥的随机微分方程，利用分布残差调制噪声注入和去除，实现自适应图像修复，在多种图像恢复任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散桥模型缺乏统一分析视角，且通过全局噪声注入和去除重建图像会扭曲未退化区域。需要一种能自适应修复退化区域同时保持完好区域的方法。

Method: 理论推导广义扩散桥的随机微分方程，获得其正向和反向过程的解析公式。利用给定分布的残差来调制噪声注入和去除过程，实现自适应恢复。

Result: 实验证明RDBM在多种图像恢复任务中达到最先进的定性和定量性能，现有桥模型都是RDBM的特例，验证了所提模型的最优性。

Conclusion: RDBM提供了一种统一的扩散桥模型分析框架，通过残差调制实现自适应图像修复，在保持完好区域的同时有效恢复退化区域，代码已公开。

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both
qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/RDBM.

TL;DR: 提出了一个任务无关的多模态融合框架，能够融合时间序列和单时间戳图像，实现跨模态生成和稳健的下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索时间序列和图像的多模态融合，通过统一表示空间对齐离散的图像和时间序列标记，提升跨模态生成能力和下游任务性能。

Method: 采用确定性和学习策略进行时间序列量化，利用掩码相关学习目标在统一表示空间中对齐图像和时间序列标记。

Result: 在预训练模型中，从卫星图像生成一致的全球温度剖面，并在下游任务中平均R²提高6%、RMSE提高2%，优于基线方法50%的R²和12%的RMSE。

Conclusion: 该任务无关的预训练方法在多模态融合中表现出色，通过梯度敏感性分析提供了模型稳健性的见解。

Abstract: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and
single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream
performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for
time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning
objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified
representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the
pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from
satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across
downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific
fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods
by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity
across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepSalt是一个基于深度学习的谱转移框架，通过知识蒸馏和新型谱适应单元，将实验室光谱仪的精细光谱信息迁移到卫星高光谱遥感中，实现无需大量地面采样的精准大尺度土壤盐分估算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤盐渍化严重威胁生态系统和农业生产力，实验室光谱测量精度高但难以扩展到大范围，而卫星遥感虽能大范围观测但缺乏精细光谱解析能力，需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出DeepSalt框架，结合知识蒸馏策略和新型谱适应单元，将高分辨率实验室光谱知识迁移到卫星高光谱数据中，实现跨域光谱信息传递。

Result: 在综合实证基准测试中，DeepSalt相比无显式域适应的方法取得显著性能提升，能有效泛化到未见地理区域，解释大部分盐分变异。

Conclusion: DeepSalt成功实现了从实验室光谱到卫星遥感的光谱知识迁移，为大尺度土壤盐分监测提供了一种无需大量地面采样的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and
agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so,
reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral
properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light
reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy
provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits
scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite
imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained
interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages
knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer
high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to
satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for
extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity
estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks.
DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit
domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation
Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively
generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of
the salinity variance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文从总体最小二乘法角度统一了两种结构张量构造方法，证明Granlund和Knutsson 1995的修正项不必要，简化了张量解释并扩展了滤波器选择范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Bigun和Granlund 1987与Granlund和Knutsson 1995提出的两种看似不同的结构张量构造方法之间的理论联系，寻求统一的理论框架。

Method: 通过总体最小二乘法线拟合功率谱的视角，重新解释两种结构张量构造方法，分析其数学等价性和差异。

Result: 证明两种方法在TLS框架下可以统一，Granlund和Knutsson的修正项可省略，确保张量保持半正定性，简化特征值解释，并扩展了可用滤波器类型。

Conclusion: 基于TLS的统一视角不仅调和了两种结构张量构造方法，还带来了理论简化、解释清晰化和滤波器选择灵活性等额外优势。

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法从3D参考点生成物体查询，但有些参考点距离目标物体较远，容易导致误检。

Method: 使用深度信息和2D检测来采样参考点，确保参考点位于物体表面或内部；引入混合注意力机制融合历史检测结果与深度引导查询，形成混合查询。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，mAP提升6.3%，NDS提升4.3%。

Conclusion: 深度引导的查询生成和混合注意力机制能有效提升3D物体检测性能，特别是在处理部分遮挡物体时表现更好。

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object
queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.
However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often
far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In
this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection
(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that
reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.
Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results
with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the
nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\%
in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection
Score (NDS).

Motivation: 现有方法难以准确评估具有多样化架构、训练策略和任务对齐的新兴预训练模型的可迁移性。

Method: ITM框架隐式建模每个模型的内在可迁移性，采用分治变分近似策略高效近似嵌入空间演化。

Result: 在涵盖广泛训练机制和模型类型的综合基准测试中，ITM在稳定性、有效性和效率方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ITM能够更准确地评估预训练模型的可迁移性，促进预训练-微调范式的发展，支持更广泛的模型和下游任务。

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

Result: 在标准KITTI数据集上达到93.92%的准确率，在新建的E3D数据集上比基线方法提升24.88%

Conclusion: 该方法能够选择性地整合跨模态知识，在复杂工业场景中对不可靠模态信息具有优越的鲁棒性

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in
3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing
methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios
characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a
novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates
cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in
complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into
a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism.
Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is
designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust
to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named
Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to
benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but
also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D

Result: 方法能够在复杂场景间建立准确的对应关系，并成功应用于轨迹和路径点转移。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D场景类比提供了一种无需训练、开放词汇的解决方案，支持在未见环境中进行演示和任务计划转移。

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and
plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been
proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene
regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer
of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for
imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing
methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.
In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D
scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our
approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse
graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from
3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a
coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the
correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate
correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in
trajectory and waypoint transfer.

Motivation: 摄像头广泛使用产生海量视频数据，远超人工监控能力，这对公共安全构成关键挑战，需要及时检测异常或犯罪事件。

Method: 通过将视频转换为文本描述，并通过文本蕴含对标签进行评分，研究预训练视觉-LLM是否可以作为空间基础的零样本异常检测器。

Result: 少量样本示例可以提高某些模型的准确性，但可能增加误报；隐私过滤器（特别是全身GAN变换）会引入不一致性降低准确性。当前视觉-LLM在简单、空间显著事件上成功，在噪声空间线索和身份混淆方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 提出了无需任务特定训练即可增强空间基础的具体路径：结构感知提示、跨片段的轻量级空间记忆、描述期间使用场景图或3D姿态先验，以及保留动作相关几何的隐私方法。

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming
amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This
presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely
detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and
prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is
fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper
investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing
anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing
the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse
2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs
can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video
into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate
four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and
privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some
models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially
full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.
These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially
salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity
obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial
grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight
spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,
and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions
zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for
embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating
VLMs is publicly available at:

TL;DR: DecoDINO是一个基于DECO框架的三分支网络，用于改进人体与物体之间的顶点级接触预测，在DAMON基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DECO模型在野外环境中存在局限性，包括只能预测二元接触图、在软表面、遮挡、儿童和脚部误报方面表现不佳，需要改进这些缺陷。

Method: 使用两个DINOv2 ViT-g/14编码器，采用类别平衡损失权重减少偏差，通过补丁级交叉注意力改进局部推理，最后通过轻量级MLP和softmax分配语义接触标签。

Result: 在DAMON基准测试中，二元接触F1分数提升7%，测地误差减半，并增加了对象级语义标签预测；消融研究表明LoRA微调和双编码器是关键改进因素。

Conclusion: DecoDINO在DAMON挑战赛的两个任务中都优于基准模型，证明了其在人体-物体接触预测方面的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding
objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models
used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the
wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and
struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot
contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch
network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders,
class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention
for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a
lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also
tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the
simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON
benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii)
halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level
semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual
encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge
baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at

that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: PathSearch是一个用于全玻片图像检索的框架，结合细粒度注意力马赛克表示和全局玻片嵌入，通过视觉语言对比学习实现准确灵活的病理图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全玻片图像检索的挑战，包括千兆像素尺度和在大量无关内容中捕捉细微语义差异的困难，以支持精确诊断、提高观察者一致性和辅助基于案例的教育。

Method: 统一细粒度注意力马赛克表示与全局玻片嵌入，通过视觉语言对比学习在6,926个玻片-报告对上进行训练，支持基于马赛克的图像到图像检索和多模态文本查询检索。

Result: 在四个公共病理数据集和三个内部队列上评估，涵盖解剖部位检索、肿瘤亚型分类、肿瘤与非肿瘤区分和分级等任务，在多个器官上表现优于传统图像检索框架，多中心阅读研究显示能提高诊断准确性、增强信心和改善观察者间一致性。

Conclusion: PathSearch是一个可扩展且通用的数字病理检索解决方案，在真实临床场景中证明了其有效性。

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new
possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among
these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to
identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting
precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting
example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images
(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of
capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To
overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that
unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide
embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a
corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained
morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and
flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)
mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide
research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly
retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public
pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including
anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,
and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and
stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional
image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further
demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,
and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical
scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable
retrieval solution for digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了最先进的深度伪造检测器在受莫尔条纹影响的视频上的表现，发现莫尔伪影会使检测性能下降高达25.4%，而去莫尔方法反而使问题恶化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实场景中智能手机拍摄数字屏幕时产生的莫尔条纹对深度伪造检测的干扰问题，这一问题此前很少受到关注。

Method: 收集了12,832个视频数据集，涵盖多个公开数据集，并在不同现实条件下拍摄；使用DeepMoiréFake数据集和两种合成莫尔条纹生成技术进行实验；评估了15个顶级检测器的性能。

Result: 莫尔伪影使检测性能下降高达25.4%，合成莫尔条纹导致准确率下降21.4%；令人惊讶的是，去莫尔方法反而使准确率下降高达17.2%。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发能够稳健处理莫尔失真以及其他现实挑战的检测模型，DMF数据集的引入旨在推动研究缩小受控实验与实际深度伪造检测之间的差距。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world
settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces
Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study
systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on
Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We
collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,
DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world
conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera
angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake
detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake,
referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques.
Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts
degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e
patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods,
intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing
accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for
detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other
realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By
introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the
gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出Eruku方法，将风格化手写文本生成重新定义为多模态提示条件生成任务，通过引入特殊文本输入标记和改进的自回归模型，解决了内容可控性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归Transformer方法需要额外输入、缺乏停止机制、可能陷入重复循环并产生视觉伪影，因此需要改进风格化手写文本生成的内容可控性。

Method: 将HTG作为多模态提示条件生成任务，引入特殊文本输入标记以更好地与视觉标记对齐，并设计了基于Classifier-Free-Guidance的自回归模型策略。

Result: 实验表明Eruku方法相比之前方案需要更少输入、对未见风格泛化更好、更忠实地遵循文本提示，改进了内容依从性。

Conclusion: Eruku方法通过重新定义HTG任务和改进自回归模型，有效提升了风格化手写文本生成的内容可控性和质量。

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled
Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible
applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.
A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies
that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising
results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently
proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method
requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in
repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the
autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned
generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing
special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.
Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our
autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate
that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer
inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the
textual prompt, improving content adherence.

Motivation: 随着对视觉语言模型依赖增加，需要评估多模态模型的复杂性和方向正确性，特别是解决文本主导问题和模态交互探索不足的担忧。

Method: 使用Shapley值计算特征归因和模态评分，将视频帧和文本元素视为平等特征，将多选VQA任务视为视频、问题和答案三个模态的交互。

Result: 结果显示模型对文本的依赖性，多选VQA任务实际上退化为模型忽略干扰项的能力。

Conclusion: 当前VLM模型在多选视频问答中存在文本主导问题，任务本质简化为识别和排除干扰项的能力。

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to
answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of
research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering
(VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The
reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about
potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between
modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the
right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We
propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality
scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are
arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of
varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on
multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual
elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task
as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our
results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA
task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors. Code available at

<details>

Motivation: 现实世界物体具有自然分层结构，传统CNN平面分类方法忽略了这种层次关系，分层结构能提供更好的上下文理解并控制错误严重程度

Method: 基于YOLO模型构建端到端分层模型，提出新颖分层架构、改进损失函数和分层性能评估指标，在两种不同分层分类方案上进行训练评估

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能有效处理现实世界物体固有的分层结构，而传统平面分类算法往往忽略这些结构

Conclusion: 所提出的分层方法能够更好地捕捉物体间的层次关系，为图像分类任务提供更丰富的上下文信息

Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are
predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a
specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a
natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification
tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better
contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes.
Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model
for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A
novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance
metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The
proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical
categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that
disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting
for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how
the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present
in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often
overlook.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于ODE和SDE的求解器存在互补的弱点：ODE求解器沿确定性轨迹积累不可约的梯度误差，而SDE方法在步长预算有限时遭受放大的离散化误差。

Method: 引入AdaSDE，一种单步SDE求解器，通过轻量级蒸馏估计每个步骤的可学习系数，动态调节误差校正强度，可与现有求解器集成。

Result: 在5次函数评估下，AdaSDE在CIFAR-10上达到4.18的FID分数，在FFHQ上达到8.05，在LSUN Bedroom上达到6.96。

Conclusion: AdaSDE成功统一了ODE的效率和SDE的误差弹性，实现了最先进的扩散采样性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation
solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our
theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary
weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along
deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores
of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom. Codes are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有讽刺检测研究主要关注单图像场景，忽略了多图像之间潜在的语义和情感关系，无法有效建模现实世界中由多图像线索触发的讽刺情况。

Method: 提出跨图像推理模型(CIRM)，通过目标跨图像序列建模捕捉图像间潜在联系，并基于文本-图像对应关系引入相关性引导的细粒度跨模态融合机制。

Result: MMSD3.0被证明是有效可靠的基准，能更好反映真实世界条件；CIRM在MMSD、MMSD2.0和MMSD3.0上均达到最先进性能，在单图像和多图像场景下都有效。

Conclusion: 多图像讽刺检测是一个重要但被忽视的研究方向，CIRM模型通过跨图像推理和细粒度融合机制，在单图像和多图像场景下都表现出色，为现实世界讽刺检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and
methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential
semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in
modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world
settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed
entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We
further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted
cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In
addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion
mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during
integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative
baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an
effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions.
Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0
and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDReID是一个灵活的多模态物体重识别框架，通过解耦模态共享特征和模态特定特征，在模态匹配和不匹配场景下都能有效工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的物体重识别系统经常面临模态不一致问题，查询图像和库图像来自不同传感器（如RGB、NIR、TIR），但现有方法大多假设模态匹配条件，限制了实际应用的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出MDReID框架，包含模态解耦学习（MDL）和模态感知度量学习（MML）。MDL将模态特征显式分解为模态共享和模态特定表示，MML通过度量学习策略增强两个组件间的正交性和互补性。

Result: 在三个多模态重识别基准测试（RGBNT201、RGBNT100、MSVR310）上的实验表明，MDReID在模态匹配场景下分别获得9.8%、3.0%和11.5%的mAP提升，在模态不匹配场景下平均提升3.4%、11.8%和10.9%。

Conclusion: MDReID通过有效解耦模态特征，显著提升了多模态物体重识别系统在现实场景中的性能，特别是在模态不匹配情况下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality
inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors
(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched
conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical
applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible
any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both
modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the
insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:
modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and
modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent
characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key
components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric
Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into
modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective
retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored
metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity
between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID
benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the
superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of
9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average
gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios,
respectively. The code is available at:

Abstract: Medical image analysis is central to drug discovery and preclinical

We address classification of paclitaxel (Taxol) exposure from phase-contrast

challenges full-image models. We propose a simple tiling-and-aggregation
pipeline that operates on local patches and combines tile outputs into an image
label, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the benchmark dataset and
improving over the published baseline by around 20 percentage points, with
trends confirmed by cross-validation. To understand why tiling is effective, we
further apply Grad-CAM and Score-CAM and attention analyses, which enhance
model interpretability and point toward robustness-oriented directions for
future medical image research. Code is released to facilitate reproduction and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面跟踪在深度学习的时代发展受限，主要原因是缺乏大规模平台。现有基准数据集在目标多样性方面不足，无法满足现实应用需求。

Method: 创建PlanarTrack数据集，包含1000个短期和150个长期视频序列，所有视频在非约束条件下录制，每个视频帧通过四角点手动标注，并经过多轮精细检查和优化。每个序列只捕获一个独特目标以增强目标多样性。

Result: PlanarTrack是目前最大、最多样化且最具挑战性的平面跟踪数据集。评估了10个代表性平面跟踪器，结果显示顶级跟踪器在PlanarTrack上性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 平面跟踪仍需更多努力来提升性能。PlanarTrack为未来研究提供了比较基准，数据和结果将公开发布。

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at
https://github.com/HengLan/PlanarTrack

Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在遥感超分辨率中训练成本高、推理慢、辅助信息利用不足以及缺乏下游任务评估的问题。

Method: 基于冻结预训练的Stable Diffusion，集成跨模态注意力机制（DEM、土地覆盖、月份、SAR数据），使用适配器和定制傅里叶NDVI损失平衡空间细节和光谱保真度。

Result: 在RGB和IR通道上分别达到PSNR/SSIM 32.63/0.84和23.99/0.78，最低NDVI MSE（0.042），推理速度0.39秒/图像，在作物分类任务中F1得分0.86优于Sentinel-2。

Conclusion: LSSR框架显著提升了遥感超分辨率的性能，展示了在精准农业中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
agriculture.

Conclusion: VideoTG-R1通过解决部分标注和难定位样本问题，实现了数据高效的视频时序定位训练，显著提升了性能并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos
based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video
understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the
challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples.
(1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond
the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground
samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and
indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference
among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with
reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically,
we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict
query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to
identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing
ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess
the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that
dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the
training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer
preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples
and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data

experiments on the existing weights of DDColor, we found that it has
limitations in some frequency bands and the color cast problem caused by
insufficient input dimension. We construct two optimization schemes and combine
them, which achieves the performance improvement of indicators such as PSNR and
SSIM of the images after DDColor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决点云学习领域因缺乏大规模数据集而受限的问题，通过对称性概念创建具有已知结构和高变异性的形状。

Method: 利用对称性概念构建公式驱动的数据集，生成具有已知结构的形状，确保精确标注和高度可变性。

Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale
datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due
to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present
Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary
scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground
truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples,
enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy
extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we
create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural
networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate
that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised
pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such
as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning
capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to
classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and
application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and
provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our
approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and
the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and
innovation in point cloud learning.

TL;DR: BrainFound是一个基于DINO-v2的自监督基础模型，专门用于脑部MRI分析。它通过整合3D体积信息，支持单模态和多模态输入，在疾病检测和图像分割等任务中表现优异，特别是在标签稀缺和多对比度场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医学影像分析通常依赖2D切片和大量标注数据，而脑部MRI的3D特性和多模态特性需要更先进的方法来充分利用体积信息并减少对专家标注的依赖。

Method: 扩展DINO-v2视觉变换器，整合连续MRI切片的体积信息，支持单模态和多模态输入（如T1、T2、FLAIR），实现3D脑部解剖建模。

Result: BrainFound在疾病检测和图像分割任务中持续优于现有的自监督预训练策略和监督基线，特别是在标签稀缺和多对比度设置下表现突出。

Conclusion: BrainFound为3D神经影像提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案，具有临床部署和研究创新的巨大潜力，能够提高诊断准确性并减少对大量专家标注的依赖。

Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical
imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale,
unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised
foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision
transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts
DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information
from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms.
It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of
downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while
generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show
that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining
strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and
multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI
modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces
dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a
scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant
potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的工作流程，用于高效准确地将大规模移动激光扫描点云注册到目标模型点云，特别针对城市街道场景的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市环境中点云密度、噪声特性和遮挡场景变化带来的挑战，这些在繁华城市中心很常见。

Method: 引入两种方法：Semi-sphere Check预处理技术通过识别相互正交的平面表面优化分割MLS轨迹数据；Planar Voxel-based Generalized Iterative Closest Point精细注册方法在体素分区中选择性利用平面表面。

Result: 在慕尼黑内城真实数据集上的实验表明，该工作流程实现了亚0.01米的平均注册精度，同时显著缩短处理时间，计算时间比传统点对平面ICP方法减少50%以上。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法具有推进自动化3D城市建模和更新的潜力，可直接应用于城市规划、基础设施管理和动态城市监测。

Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately
register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model
point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the
complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the
challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise
characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city
centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic
city monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多平面截面的CAD逆向工程新方法，能够重建可编辑的参数化CAD模型，并首次在重建过程中直接融入草图约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAD逆向工程方法存在局限性：自下而上的几何驱动方法无法生成完全参数化输出，自上而下的策略忽略细粒度几何细节，且都忽视了草图级约束这一CAD建模的关键要素。

Method: 受人类设计师手动执行任务的启发，采用多平面截面提取2D模式，更有效地捕捉精细参数细节，实现可编辑CAD模型的重建。

Result: 该方法在重建详细且可编辑的CAD模型方面优于现有最先进方法，首次将草图约束直接整合到重建过程中。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模仿人类设计过程，解决了CAD逆向工程中的关键挑战，为从3D扫描生成参数化CAD表示提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing
and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon
existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a
process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due
to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep
learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up,
geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs,
and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details.
Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling:
sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD
reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task.
Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and
capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction
of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the
reconstruction process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析面临高质量标注样本获取困难和类别分布不均的挑战，传统迁移学习在类别分布不规则时效果下降

Method: 使用基于样本分解粒度的课程学习策略训练通用无标签样本，并在下游任务中采用类别分解方法处理类别分布不均问题

Result: 在脑肿瘤数据集准确率96.60%，数字膝关节X射线数据集75.60%，Mini-DDSM数据集93.35%（基于ResNet-50）；使用DenseNet-121分别达到95.77%、80.36%和93.22%

Conclusion: CURVETE方法能有效提升医学图像分类性能，特别是在样本有限和类别分布不均的情况下优于其他训练策略

Abstract: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a
notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques,
leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However,
the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular
distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional
neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised
Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples,
enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification
performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based
on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic
unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class
distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream
task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image
datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We
investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised
sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning
component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that
the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy
of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray
dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50.
Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%,
80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM
datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像推理方法（如"Thinking with Images"）在MLLMs中表现出色，但这种动态推理范式尚未扩展到视频推理任务。

Method: 构建Video-Thinker-10K数据集，采用监督微调学习推理格式，然后使用组相对策略优化强化推理能力，使MLLMs能自主执行grounding和captioning任务。

Result: Video-Thinker-7B在Video-Holmes、CG-Bench-Reasoning和VRBench等基准测试中显著优于现有基线方法Video-R1，在7B规模MLLMs中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Video-Thinker成功将动态推理范式扩展到视频领域，实现了MLLMs在视频推理中的自主工具使用能力，无需依赖外部工具构建和调用。

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

TL;DR: UrbanIng-V2X是首个大规模多模态数据集，支持车辆和基础设施传感器在三个城市交叉路口的协同感知，包含34个时间对齐和空间校准的传感器序列，提供12个车载RGB相机、2个车载LiDAR、17个基础设施热成像相机和12个基础设施LiDAR的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实世界数据集通常局限于单个交叉路口或单个车辆，缺乏多车辆和多基础设施传感器在多个交叉路口的综合感知数据集，这限制了算法在不同交通环境中的基准测试，可能导致过拟合和误导性的高性能表现。

Method: 在德国英戈尔施塔特的三个城市交叉路口部署了协同感知系统，包含两辆车辆和最多三个基础设施传感器杆，收集了34个20秒的传感器序列，所有数据都进行了时间对齐和空间校准。

Result: 数据集包含约712k个标注实例，以10Hz频率标注了13个物体类别的3D边界框，提供了全面的最先进协同感知方法评估。

Conclusion: UrbanIng-V2X填补了多车辆和多基础设施传感器在多个交叉路口协同感知数据集的空白，为算法在多样化交通环境中的基准测试提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
environment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MergeMix是一种连接监督微调和强化学习的训练时增强范式，通过注意力感知的图像混合和偏好驱动训练来提升多模态大语言模型的视觉语言对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调需要大量人工标注且无法捕捉细微偏好，强化学习存在开销大和不稳定的问题，需要一种兼顾可扩展性、鲁棒性和对齐质量的解决方案。

Method: 首先通过token合并进行注意力感知的图像混合，然后构建混合图像与原始图像的偏好对，使用SimPO损失进行优化。

Result: MergeMix在分类任务中超越了其他基于启发式的方法，实现了竞争性的准确率和更高的效率。

Conclusion: MergeMix为分类和多模态大语言模型中的偏好对齐提供了一种可扩展的方法，增强了注意力一致性和训练效率。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
(RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations
and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for
training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations
highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.
To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm
that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via
token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then
presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference
pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a
mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency,
surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with
improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in
classification and MLLMs.

Motivation: 当前体积视频重光照方法难以提供时间稳定的生产级结果，扩散方法在单帧表现良好但扩展到序列时存在噪声和不稳定性问题

Method: 结合扩散材料先验与时间正则化，使用光流引导正则化聚合多帧材料属性，从高斯不透明度场提取网格代理进行物理渲染

Result: 在真实和合成数据上比纯扩散方法显著更稳定，能够处理超出视频扩散模型可行长度的序列

Conclusion: 混合方法平衡学习先验与物理约束，是实现生产级体积视频重光照的实用步骤

Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances
into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally
stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition
methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and
instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain
constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that
combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and
physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic
estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading
components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such
as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity
Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real
and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially
more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while
scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results
indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically
grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric
video relighting.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在复杂推理任务上训练困难，主要由于高质量图像-文本推理数据稀缺，而文本推理资源丰富但难以直接用于VLM

Method: 结合GRPO强化学习和在线蒸馏，通过教师模型指导学生模型的推理轨迹，并强调冷启动对齐对有效迁移的重要性

Result: 在MMMU-Pro、MathVision、MathVista和LogicVista等多个基准测试中显著超越基线模型，达到最先进水平

Conclusion: VOLD框架成功实现了从文本教师模型到VLM学生的推理能力迁移，冷启动对齐是在线蒸馏成功的关键因素

Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a
challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning
data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but
it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To
address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning
capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,
VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces
to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using
GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an
effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that
without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,
on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD
across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and
LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and
improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the
importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a
text-only teacher.

Conclusion: iPac通过利用图表示并考虑视觉实体间的固有结构和关系，为图像分类（特别是医学图像）提供了一个通用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image
processing, yet their performance in image classification tasks is hindered by
a limited consideration of the underlying structure and relationships among
visual entities. This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new
graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image
classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and
relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages,
including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph
construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph
neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and
organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation
that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental
evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac,
exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods.
Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification,
particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph
representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships
among visual entities.

Motivation: 现有方法要么专注于推理前的LoRA权重合并，要么依赖分割模型和复杂技术来隔离LoRA输出，缺乏高效且无需额外训练的多主体生成方案。

Method: 通过分析交叉注意力层权重自动生成上下文感知的动态主体掩码，在推理过程中将这些掩码直接应用于LoRA输出，无需修改LoRA或使用辅助模型。

Result: 实验验证FreeFuse在多主体生成任务中，在生成质量和可用性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeFuse提供了一种实用且高效的多主体生成解决方案，无需额外训练、无需修改LoRA、无需辅助模型，仅需提供LoRA激活词即可无缝集成到标准工作流程中。

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for
multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple
subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on
pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex
techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that
context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from
cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly
applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the
case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used
individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality
and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,
no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region
specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA
activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive
experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both
generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks. The

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoThinker框架，通过时空思维链监督和两阶段学习课程，赋予多模态大语言模型强大的自我中心推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我中心视频推理需要推断不可观察的相机背后智能体的隐藏意图和识别细粒度交互，而现有MLLMs缺乏具身的第一人称理解能力。

Method: 构建了大规模EgoRe-5M数据集，包含1300万个多样化的自我中心视频片段，标注了详细的思维链原理和密集的手-物定位；采用两阶段学习：先用SFT培养推理技能，再用RFT增强时空定位能力。

Result: EgoThinker在多个自我中心基准测试中优于现有方法，在细粒度时空定位任务上实现了显著改进。

Conclusion: EgoThinker成功解决了自我中心视频推理的核心挑战，为MLLMs提供了强大的第一人称理解能力。

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera
who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden
intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge
limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible
event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust
egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought
supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M,
a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric
video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with
detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT
on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning
RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show
that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric
benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained
spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MERGE是一个统一的图像生成和深度估计模型，基于预训练的文本到图像扩散模型，通过可插拔转换器实现两种模式的无缝切换，同时保持原始图像生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式深度估计方法在训练时会导致预训练模型的图像生成能力严重退化，需要开发既能进行深度估计又能保持图像生成能力的统一模型。

Method: 提出play-and-plug框架，通过简单可插拔转换器实现图像生成和深度估计模式切换；采用Group Reuse机制促进参数重用和提高可学习参数利用率。

Result: MERGE在多个深度估计基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时完全保留了预训练模型的原始图像生成能力。

Conclusion: MERGE证明了预训练文本到图像模型不仅能进行图像生成，还能轻松扩展到深度估计任务，为多任务学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot
capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic
degradation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We
introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation,
starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that
the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also
expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a
play-and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image
generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters.
Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and
improve the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes
the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model
while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other
unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The
code will be made available at https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/MERGE

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Lookahead Anchoring方法，利用未来时间步的关键帧作为方向性锚点，解决音频驱动人体动画中的身份漂移问题，无需额外关键帧生成阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动的人体动画模型在时间自回归生成过程中容易出现身份漂移问题，现有使用关键帧作为时间锚点的方法需要额外生成阶段且限制自然运动动态。

Method: 提出前瞻锚定方法，利用当前生成窗口前方的未来时间步关键帧作为方向性信标，模型在响应即时音频线索的同时持续追求这些未来锚点，通过持久指导保持身份一致性。

Result: 在三个人体动画模型上应用该方法，实现了更好的唇同步、身份保持和视觉质量，在多种架构上都展示了改进的时间条件控制。

Conclusion: 前瞻锚定方法通过利用未来关键帧作为方向性锚点，有效解决了身份漂移问题，且前瞻距离自然控制表达性与一致性的平衡。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are

TL;DR: FARMER是一个结合归一化流和自回归模型的生成框架，用于直接从原始像素进行可处理似然估计和高质量图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续自回归模型在视觉像素数据上建模时面临的序列过长和高维空间问题，统一归一化流和自回归模型的优势。

Method: 使用可逆自回归流将图像转换为潜在序列，通过自监督维度减少方案划分潜在通道，并设计一步蒸馏和重采样分类器自由引导算法。

Result: 在像素级生成模型中取得竞争性性能，同时提供精确似然和可扩展训练。

Conclusion: FARMER成功统一了归一化流和自回归模型，为直接像素建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key
topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in
Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR
modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and
high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end
generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive
(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image
synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive
flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled
implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity
in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction
scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant
groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we
design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference
speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to
boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER
achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative
models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了InFlux基准数据集，为具有动态相机内参的视频提供逐帧真实内参标注，包含14.3万+标注帧和386个高分辨率视频，解决了现有基准缺乏动态内参变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数3D算法假设相机内参在视频中保持不变，但现实世界视频中内参经常变化。现有基准缺乏动态内参变化和场景多样性，阻碍了该领域发展。

Method: 构建了全面的标定实验查找表，扩展了Kalibr工具箱以提高精度和鲁棒性，创建了包含室内外视频的基准数据集。

Result: 评估现有内参预测方法发现，大多数方法在动态内参视频上难以实现准确预测。

Conclusion: InFlux基准填补了动态相机内参基准的空白，为评估和改进内参预测方法提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,

*Yusu Qian,Cheng Wan,Chao Jia,Yinfei Yang,Qingyu Zhao,Zhe Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM-Bench是一个基于谜题的视觉挑战基准，通过要求模型识别推理链中的第一个错误步骤来评估多模态大语言模型的推理一致性，而不仅仅是最终答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估仅关注最终答案准确性，无法评估模型的推理过程是否一致和可靠。需要一种诊断性评估方法来衡量模型的逻辑一致性和错误检测能力。

Method: 设计包含符号、几何和类比推理的多步骤视觉谜题，要求模型在给定包含一个错误的逐步推理链中识别第一个错误步骤。

Result: 评估显示最先进的多模态大语言模型在流畅生成和忠实推理之间存在持续差距，模型能产生看似合理的推理链但经常无法定位简单的逻辑错误。

Conclusion: PRISM-Bench通过将答案生成与推理验证分离，为多模态推理能力提供了更精确的评估工具，强调了在开发可信赖多模态大语言模型时需要诊断性评估协议。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual
challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but
how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only
final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual
puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error,
models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables
fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual
reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric,
and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern
matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap
between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible
CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer
generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on
multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic
evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelRefer是一个统一的区域级多模态大语言模型框架，支持对图像和视频中用户指定区域进行细粒度理解。通过尺度自适应对象标记器和对象中心注入模块，实现了高效的对象级推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM主要关注整体场景理解，忽视了细粒度的对象中心推理需求。需要开发能够对用户指定区域进行精细理解的模型。

Method: 提出尺度自适应对象标记器(SAOT)生成紧凑的对象表示，设计PixelRefer-Lite变体通过对象中心注入模块预融合全局上下文，构建轻量级对象专用框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PixelRefer以较少训练样本达到领先性能，PixelRefer-Lite在保持高语义保真度的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: PixelRefer框架在细粒度视觉理解任务中表现出色，其轻量级变体PixelRefer-Lite在效率和准确性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most
existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often
overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,
we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables
advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both
images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention
predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive
Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object
representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual
tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of
PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion
module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight
Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while
maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction
tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction
dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that
PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while
PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

TL;DR: Concerto是一个模拟人类概念学习的简约框架，通过3D模态内自蒸馏和2D-3D跨模态联合嵌入，学习更一致和信息的空间特征，在3D场景感知任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类通过多感官协同学习抽象概念的启发，旨在开发能够从单模态回忆多模态表示的空间认知模型。

Method: 结合3D模态内自蒸馏和2D-3D跨模态联合嵌入，通过零样本可视化学习一致的空间特征。

Result: 在3D场景感知线性探测中分别比最先进的2D和3D自监督模型提升14.2%和4.8%；在ScanNet上达到80.7% mIoU的新SOTA；还开发了视频点云空间理解变体和CLIP语言空间投影器。

Conclusion: Concerto能够学习具有优越细粒度几何和语义一致性的空间表示，支持开放世界感知。

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,
such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

Motivation: 利用人工智能与计算心理学的结合，通过计算手段建模、理解和交互复杂的人类心理状态，弥合孤立预测建模与交互式心理分析系统之间的差距。

Method: 采用端到端开发流程：1) 在四个心理学数据集上建立基准性能；2) 微调Transformer模型，解决回归任务数值不稳定性和资源约束下的训练挑战；3) 使用参数高效技术微调生成式LLM作为交互式"人格大脑"；4) 将预测和生成模型架构为可扩展的微服务生态系统。

Abstract: The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology
presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human
psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a
comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between
isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological
analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development
lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four
diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques.
Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that
necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical
engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in
regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting
large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative
large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques
to function as an interactive "Personality Brain." Finally, the entire suite of
predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust,
scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful
stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing,
showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and
the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI
research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach,
demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates
predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical
model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: PREFINE是一个无需参数更新或直接用户反馈的个性化故事生成框架，通过构建伪用户代理和用户特定评估标准来实现个性化生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法依赖显式反馈或微调带来的用户负担、数据收集、计算成本和隐私问题

Method: 构建伪用户代理和用户特定评估标准，让代理基于这些标准代表用户进行批判和优化

Result: 在PerDOC和PerMPST数据集上，PREFINE在自动评估中获得了更高的胜率和统计显著分数，且不损害故事的一般质量

Conclusion: 伪用户代理和用户特定评估标准对提升个性化性能至关重要，该方法在对话系统、教育和推荐等更广泛应用中具有潜力

Abstract: While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the
quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing
personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional
approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical
issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and
privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided
Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine
paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a
user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation
criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's
behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized
generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets.
We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the
contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations
(LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically
significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story
quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user
agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization
performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling
efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems,
education, and recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实AI系统处理复杂问题时，多个大语言模型智能体之间的不一致约定会导致协调失败，需要可靠、一致的通信机制，且随着系统规模扩大，可扩展性成为关键问题。

Method: 引入Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN)命名游戏，研究轻量级结构如何引导约定形成，比较结构化通信与无约束自然语言的效果。

Result: 结构化通信相比无约束自然语言实现更快收敛，协议一致性提高达5.8倍。

Conclusion: 最小化结构可作为简单控制旋钮实现高效多智能体协调，在命名游戏之外具有更广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often
through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents
develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications
such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require
reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as
systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming
game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We
compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find
faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that
minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent
coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

TL;DR: 研究发现解码器自回归语言模型在知识密集型任务中存在能力天花板，即使损失持续下降，准确率也几乎不提升，而在过程性任务中仍遵循传统缩放规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究解码器自回归语言模型在参数规模扩展时，不同任务类型的能力提升模式是否存在差异，特别是知识密集型任务是否会出现能力天花板。

Method: 系统评估OPT和Pythia模型家族（70M-30B参数，240倍缩放），分析损失和准确率的关系，并进行注意力干预实验。

Result: 知识检索任务准确率提升微乎其微，MMLU数学基准准确率稳定在19-20%，而算术等过程性任务则呈现传统缩放模式。注意力扰动导致性能灾难性崩溃。

Conclusion: 对于使用OPT和Pythia架构的知识密集型应用，超过1-2B参数的扩展几乎不带来准确率提升，这为资源分配决策提供了量化依据。

Abstract: We document empirical capability ceilings in decoder-only autoregressive
language models across knowledge-intensive tasks. Systematic evaluation of OPT
and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling)
reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement
despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains
flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy
loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show
conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention
intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping
attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse
(complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements
have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications
using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers
minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings
quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform
resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental
constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific
limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse
architectural approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了GeoThoughts数据集和GeoThought-MLLM模型，通过链式思维训练提升多模态模型在几何推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本数学问题解决中表现出色，但在视觉推理特别是几何问题解决中性能显著下降，主要由于几何问题的内在复杂性（需要详细图像理解和多步推理）和现有数据集的局限性（规模不足、多样性不够、缺乏明确推理轨迹）。

Method: 开发了GeoThoughts数据集（包含6,243个样本的Geo-Thought-6K和10,834个样本的Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K），每个样本包含视觉描述、逐步解决方案、明确推理链、反思步骤和最终答案。基于此数据集训练了GeoThought-MLLM多模态数学推理模型。

Result: GeoThought-MLLM模型在几何任务中超越了现有基准，证明使用链式思维数据集训练能够提升几何推理能力，在领域内和领域外设置中均有改善。

Conclusion: 通过分析失败案例发现，错误主要源于数学概念错误理解或空间判断失误，通过调用链式思维纠正这些错误，模型能够产生正确答案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual
reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance
substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges.
Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic
complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step
reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack
sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently
hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed
the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two
subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version
Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual
descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection
steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a
mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking
processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in
geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset
improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that
errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts
or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model
produces correct answers.

Abstract: This work applies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to three graph
optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning
Tree, and Shortest Path. GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample
solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the
Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, selecting edges for
spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark
instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions.
For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of
nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical
algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact
solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the
number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size
grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from
classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that
generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned
policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational
scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance,
GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational
resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances
where classical exact methods become infeasible.

### [226] [Computational Hardness of Reinforcement Learning with Partial $q^π$-Realizability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21888)
*Shayan Karimi,Xiaoqi Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了在线性函数逼近新框架（部分qπ可实现性）下强化学习的计算复杂度，证明了在该设置下学习ε最优策略是计算困难的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在弱于qπ可实现性但强于q*可实现性的部分qπ可实现性框架下，函数逼近自然出现的实际模型中的计算复杂度问题。

Method: 通过从δ-Max-3SAT和δ-Max-3SAT(b)问题归约到GLinear-κ-RL（贪婪策略）和SLinear-κ-RL（softmax策略）实例，建立计算困难性。

Result: 证明了在参数化贪婪策略集下学习ε最优策略是NP困难的，在softmax策略集下存在指数级下界（除非NP=RP）。

Conclusion: 在部分qπ可实现性框架下，正面的计算结果通常无法实现，这与生成访问模型下的qπ可实现性形成对比。

Abstract: This paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement
learning in a novel linear function approximation regime, termed partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability. In this framework, the objective is to learn an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with respect to a predefined policy set $\Pi$, under
the assumption that all value functions for policies in $\Pi$ are linearly
realizable. The assumptions of this framework are weaker than those in
$q^{\pi}$-realizability but stronger than those in $q^*$-realizability,
providing a practical model where function approximation naturally arises. We
prove that learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in this setting is
computationally hard. Specifically, we establish NP-hardness under a
parameterized greedy policy set (argmax) and show that - unless NP = RP - an
exponential lower bound (in feature vector dimension) holds when the policy set
contains softmax policies, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Our hardness results mirror those in $q^*$-realizability and suggest
computational difficulty persists even when $\Pi$ is expanded beyond the
optimal policy. To establish this, we reduce from two complexity problems,
$\delta$-Max-3SAT and $\delta$-Max-3SAT(b), to instances of GLinear-$\kappa$-RL
(greedy policy) and SLinear-$\kappa$-RL (softmax policy). Our findings indicate
that positive computational results are generally unattainable in partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability, in contrast to $q^{\pi}$-realizability under a
generative access model.

*Josip Tomo Licardo,Nikola Tankovic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了将小型开源模型作为资源高效替代方案的可行性，通过优化10亿参数的Llama 3.2模型用于多语言电商意图识别，实现了与GPT-4.1相当的99%准确率，同时大幅降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商用大型语言模型在专业任务（如电商）部署时面临高计算成本、延迟和运营费用的问题，需要寻找更资源高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用量化低秩适应（QLoRA）在合成数据集上微调10亿参数的Llama 3.2模型，然后应用后训练量化技术，创建GPU优化（GPTQ）和CPU优化（GGUF）版本。

Result: 专用1B模型达到99%准确率，与GPT-4.1性能相当。4位GPTQ减少41% VRAM使用但推理速度降低82%；GGUF格式在CPU上实现18倍推理吞吐量提升和超过90% RAM消耗减少。

Conclusion: 经过适当优化的小型开源模型不仅是可行的，而且是领域特定应用的更合适替代方案，能以极低的计算成本提供最先进的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural
language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading
commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered
by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper
investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a
resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a
one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent
recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user
queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques,
creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results
demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the
performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance
analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ
reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older
GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF
formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a
reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We
conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a
viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications,
offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

*Ji Huang,Mengfei Li,Shuai Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为分布偏移对齐（DSA）的两阶段微调方法，用于改善LLM在调查响应模拟中的性能，显著减少真实数据需求并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本方法存在提示敏感性和低准确性问题，而传统微调方法过度拟合训练集分布，无法产生比训练集更准确的结果，偏离了使用LLM模拟调查响应的初衷。

Method: DSA是一个两阶段微调方法，通过对齐不同背景下的输出分布和分布偏移，学习分布如何变化而非简单拟合训练数据。

Result: 在五个公共调查数据集上，DSA始终优于其他方法，可将真实数据需求减少53.48-69.12%，在准确性、鲁棒性和数据节省方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DSA能够提供比训练数据更接近真实分布的结果，证明了在调查模拟中的有效性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey
responses, potentially reducing the cost of large-scale data collection.
However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low
accuracy, while conventional fine-tuning approaches mostly fit the training set
distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training
set itself, which deviates from the original goal of using LLMs to simulate
survey responses. Building on this observation, we introduce Distribution Shift
Alignment (DSA), a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both the output
distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds. By
learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data, DSA
can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the
training data. Empirically, DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five
public survey datasets. We further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering
accuracy, robustness, and data savings. DSA reduces the required real data by
53.48-69.12%, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey
simulation.

Abstract: Math word problem (MWP) serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial
intelligence (AI) dating back to 1960s. This research aims to advance the
reasoning abilities of AI by mirroring the human-like cognitive intelligence.
The mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rule-based
methods, to deep learning models, and is rapidly advancing towards large
language models. However, the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for the
MWP survey along with a discussion of current development trends. Therefore, in
this paper, we aim to comprehensively review related research in MWP solving
through the lens of human cognition, to demonstrate how recent AI models are
advancing in simulating human cognitive abilities. Specifically, we summarize 5
crucial cognitive abilities for MWP solving, including Problem Understanding,
Logical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge
Learning. Focused on these abilities, we review two mainstream MWP models in
recent 10 years: neural network solvers, and LLM based solvers, and discuss the
core human-like abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problem-solving
process. Moreover, we rerun all the representative MWP solvers and supplement
their performance on 5 mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison. To the
best of our knowledge, this survey first comprehensively analyzes the
influential MWP research of the past decade from the perspective of human
reasoning cognition and provides an integrative overall comparison across
existing approaches. We hope it can inspire further research in AI reasoning.

TL;DR: LightAgent是一个移动GUI代理解决方案，通过设备-云协作结合本地3B模型和云端大模型，在保持高性能的同时显著降低云成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决移动GUI代理面临的困境：真正在设备上的小模型（4B或更小）性能不足，而能力强的模型（从7B开始）要么太大无法移动部署，要么成本过高（如仅限云端的闭源MLLM）。

Method: 1. 通过两阶段SFT->GRPO训练增强Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型；2. 集成高效长推理机制利用历史交互；3. 默认在设备上执行，仅通过实时复杂度评估将具有挑战性的子任务升级到云端。

Result: 在AndroidLab基准测试和多样化应用上的实验显示，LightAgent匹配或接近更大模型的性能，同时显著降低了云成本。

Conclusion: LightAgent通过设备-云协作有效解决了移动GUI代理的性能与成本平衡问题，为移动平台提供了可行的代理基础模型解决方案。

Abstract: With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building
GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for
mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch
interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device
models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models
(starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively
costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose
LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages
device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and
the high capability of cloud models, while avoiding their drawbacks.
Specifically, LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO
training on synthetic GUI data for strong decision-making, integrates an
efficient long-reasoning mechanism to utilize historical interactions under
tight resources, and defaults to on-device execution-only escalating
challenging subtasks to the cloud via real-time complexity assessment.
Experiments on the online AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent
matches or nears larger models, with a significant reduction in cloud costs.

Conclusion: 该框架具有可解释性和通过超参数可调性，显示出扩展到其他领域的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can already identify patterns and reason
effectively, yet their variable accuracy hampers adoption in high-stakes
decision-making applications. In this paper, we study this issue from a venture
capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder
traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a
pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated
heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning
engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule
mining to progressively refine the prediction rules.
  On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the
random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human
inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters,
showing promise to extend into other domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在部分可观测环境中，结合自监督预测编码模块的元强化学习能够学习到更紧凑、可解释的贝叶斯最优信念状态表示，相比传统元强化学习在表示学习和泛化能力方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统元强化学习虽然能学习到接近贝叶斯最优的策略，但往往无法学习到紧凑、可解释的贝叶斯最优信念状态表示，这种表示效率不足可能限制智能体的适应性和泛化能力。

Method: 将自监督预测编码模块集成到元强化学习中，受神经科学中的预测编码理论和深度强化学习中辅助预测目标的启发。

Result: 在状态机模拟中，带有预测模块的元强化学习在各种任务中都能生成更可解释的表示，更好地逼近贝叶斯最优信念状态，即使在两者都达到最优策略的情况下也是如此。在需要主动信息搜索的挑战性任务中，只有带有预测模块的元强化学习能成功学习最优表示和策略。

Conclusion: 预测学习作为在部分可观测环境中导航的智能体进行有效表示学习的指导原则具有重要作用，更好的表示学习能带来改进的泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and
generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement
learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to
learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This
representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and
generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which
suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of
Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we
investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into
meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state
machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently
generates more interpretable representations that better approximate
Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide
variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks
requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules
successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional
meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we
demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved
generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as
a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating
partial observability.

Motivation: 解决Class-D音频放大器核心转换器的实时约束问题，在纯硬件方案的高成本和纯软件方案的高端处理器昂贵之间寻找平衡。

Method: 使用SpecC方法学进行系统建模和架构探索，结合系统级评估和快速功能仿真来评估不同的硬件/软件映射方案。

Result: 成功推导出满足实时约束的HW/SW分区方案，相比纯硬件方案降低了估计成本，同时避免了纯软件方案的高端处理器开销。

Conclusion: 系统级协同设计对于早期架构洞察、快速验证和可行的成本/性能权衡具有重要价值，即使对于中等复杂度的设计也是如此。

Abstract: We present a case study applying the SpecC methodology within a system-level
hardware/software co-design flow to a PCM-to-PWM converter, the core of a
Class-D audio amplifier. The converter was modeled and explored with SpecC
methodology to derive an HW/SW partition. Using system-level estimates and fast
functional simulation, we evaluated mappings that meet real-time constraints
while reducing estimated cost of an all-hardware solution and avoiding the
expense of a purely software implementation on a high-end processor. Despite
the design's moderate complexity, the results underline the value of
system-level co-design for early architectural insight, rapid validation, and
actionable cost/performance trade-offs. [Original work from 2005; formatting

TL;DR: 论文主张将智能重新定义为构建和修正解释的能力，而非仅仅追求预测准确性。提出了能量结构化因果模型（ESCMs），通过约束而非显式输入输出映射来表示机制，使内部结构可在解释层面进行干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习系统虽然达到最先进的预测性能，但因果透明度不足：其内部表示缺乏因果语义，无法进行精确的机制编辑。需要转向以解释为中心的智能观。

Method: 引入计算解释的概念，将观察映射到可干预的因果账户。采用能量结构化因果模型（ESCMs），其中机制表示为约束（能量函数或向量场），干预通过局部手术作用于这些约束。

Result: 在ESCM框架下实例化了结构因果原则LAP和ICM，分析了经验风险最小化导致表示断裂和纠缠的问题（编码器能量对中的规范模糊性）。在温和条件下，ESCMs可恢复标准SCM语义。

Conclusion: 基于第一部分的原则（LAP、ICM、CAP）和智能作为在批评下构建解释的定义，本文为因果推理提供了形式化语言，旨在构建理解而非仅仅预测的系统。

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning optimizes for predictive accuracy, yet systems
that achieve state of the art performance remain causally opaque: their
internal representations provide no principled handle for intervention. We can
retrain such models, but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while
holding others fixed, because learned latent variables lack causal semantics.
We argue for a conceptual reorientation: intelligence is the ability to build
and refine explanations, falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that
specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention.
Explanations subsume prediction but demand more: causal commitments that can be
independently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms. We introduce
computational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready
causal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured
Causal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy
functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and
interventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes
internal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which
relations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We
provide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM
in the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization
systematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we
analyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs. Finally, we show that under
mild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics. Building on Part I's
principles (LAP, ICM, CAP) and its definition of intelligence as
explanation-building under criticism, this paper offers a formal language for
causal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand, not merely to predict.

<details>

Motivation: 当前AI模型（如GPT-4）存在能耗巨大（50-60GWh）、产生幻觉、无法部署到关键领域等问题，而人脑仅消耗20W功率，需要更高效智能的AI系统。

Conclusion: 下一代AI将是从数据密集型大型模型转向能效高、可推理、领域特定的智能代理系统，这需要硬件和算法的协同创新。

Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a tight hold on broad
aspects of society, industry, business, and governance in ways that dictate the
prosperity and might of the world's economies. The AI market size is projected
to grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI
is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual
intelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data
scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train
GPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic
that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In
contrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the
next level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal
models with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions
in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning
continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making
capability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's
large models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient
domain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of
uncertainty. To support such agents, hardware will need to be reimagined to
allow energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over the state of the art. Such a
vision of future AI systems is developed in this work.

Conclusion: 该领域已准备好从BCI扩展到BAC，需要重点关注伦理数据处理、模型可靠性和人-智能体协作框架，以确保这些系统的安全性、可信性和有效性。

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between
the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for
individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread
adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer
rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges,
recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex
cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces
technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive
discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the
field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration
(BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for
intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors,
demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust
human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe,
trustworthy, and effective.

Abstract: AI psychometrics evaluates AI systems in roles that traditionally require

competencies; (2) integrates industrial-organizational and personality
psychology to design sophisticated personas which include behavioral and
psychological descriptors, life history, and social and emotional functions;
and (3) employs structured generation with population demographic priors and
memoir inspired narratives, encoded with Pydantic schemas. In a law enforcement
assistant case study, we construct a rich dataset of personas drawn across 8
persona archetypes and SJTs across 11 attributes, and analyze behaviors across
subpopulation and scenario slices. The dataset spans 8,500 personas, 4,000

Abstract: Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in
both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for
synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each
neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or
animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural
networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For
instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations.
This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and
memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To
address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration
from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for
training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight
Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards
optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction
Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the
actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the
learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate
strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine
optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent
neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models
demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give
comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming
significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not
only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.

TL;DR: OptiTree提出了一种基于树搜索的自适应问题分解方法，通过将复杂运筹学问题分解为更简单的子问题来提升大语言模型的建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定步骤分解来生成变量、约束和目标，但由于运筹学问题具有高度复杂的数学结构，这种方法往往无法达到高性能。

Method: 开发了一个建模树，基于问题分类层次和复杂度组织运筹学问题，每个节点代表一个问题类别并包含相关的高级建模思路。通过递归搜索树来识别更简单的子问题，并自适应整合层次化思路。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准测试中，OptiTree相比最先进方法显著提升了建模准确率，实现了超过10%的改进。

Conclusion: OptiTree通过自适应问题分解和层次化思路整合，有效提升了复杂运筹学问题的建模能力。

Abstract: Optimization modeling is one of the most crucial but technical parts of
operations research (OR). To automate the modeling process, existing works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs), prompting them to break down tasks into
steps for generating variables, constraints, and objectives. However, due to
the highly complex mathematical structures inherent in OR problems, standard
fixed-step decomposition often fails to achieve high performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce OptiTree, a novel tree search approach designed to
enhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem
decomposition into simpler subproblems. Specifically, we develop a modeling
tree that organizes a wide range of OR problems based on their hierarchical
problem taxonomy and complexity, with each node representing a problem category
and containing relevant high-level modeling thoughts. Given a problem to model,
we recurrently search the tree to identify a series of simpler subproblems and
synthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the
hierarchical thoughts. Experiments show that OptiTree significantly improves
the modeling accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving over 10\%
improvements on the challenging benchmarks. The code is released at
https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/OptiTree/tree/main.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PACR（渐进式上升置信度奖励），一种基于模型内在信念的密集奖励机制，用于改进强化学习中的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR的稀疏、基于结果的奖励无法为中间推理步骤提供指导，导致探索缓慢。

Method: PACR通过计算模型对正确答案信念的渐进上升趋势作为密集奖励，约束探索空间到逻辑合理的推理区域。

Result: PACR加速了探索，用更少的轨迹达到奖励饱和，并在多个基准测试中取得改进。

Conclusion: 密集的模型内在塑造信号可以使RLVR训练更有效和可靠。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly
improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no
guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively
Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed
directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes
the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the
probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.
We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive
bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically
sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches
reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple
benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can
make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大规模CVRPTW问题，并探索了量子启发优化技术的集成潜力，可进一步加速大规模车辆路径任务。

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a
fundamental NP-hard optimization problem in logistics. Solving large-scale
instances remains computationally challenging for exact solvers. This work
introduces a multilevel graph coarsening and refinement framework that
aggregates customers into meta-nodes using a spatio-temporal distance metric.
The reduced problem is solved with classical heuristics and subsequently
expanded back into the original space with feasibility corrections. Preliminary
experiments on Solomon benchmark instances show that the proposed method
reduces computation time while preserving or improving solution quality,
particularly with respect to capacity and time window constraints. The paper
also explores the integration of quantum-inspired optimization techniques,
highlighting their potential to further accelerate large-scale vehicle routing
tasks.

Conclusion: LIFT LLM框架在卡车驾驶风险预测中实现了高准确性和强可解释性，文献知识库和微调过程对提升模型可解释性有重要贡献，展示了在数据驱动知识发现方面的潜力。

Abstract: This study proposes an interpretable prediction framework with
literature-informed fine-tuned (LIFT) LLMs for truck driving risk prediction.
The framework integrates an LLM-driven Inference Core that predicts and
explains truck driving risk, a Literature Processing Pipeline that filters and
summarizes domain-specific literature into a literature knowledge base, and a
Result Evaluator that evaluates the prediction performance as well as the
interpretability of the LIFT LLM. After fine-tuning on a real-world truck
driving risk dataset, the LIFT LLM achieved accurate risk prediction,
outperforming benchmark models by 26.7% in recall and 10.1% in F1-score.
Furthermore, guided by the literature knowledge base automatically constructed
from 299 domain papers, the LIFT LLM produced variable importance ranking
consistent with that derived from the benchmark model, while demonstrating
robustness in interpretation results to various data sampling conditions. The
LIFT LLM also identified potential risky scenarios by detecting key combination
of variables in truck driving risk, which were verified by PERMANOVA tests.
Finally, we demonstrated the contribution of the literature knowledge base and
the fine-tuning process in the interpretability of the LIFT LLM, and discussed
the potential of the LIFT LLM in data-driven knowledge discovery.

TL;DR: DynaSolidGeo是首个用于评估视觉语言模型真实空间推理能力的动态基准，专注于立体几何问题解决，通过半自动标注流程构建，包含503个专家策划的种子问题，可动态生成无限多样的多模态实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数多模态数学推理基准主要关注2D平面几何，依赖静态数据集容易导致数据污染和记忆问题，且仅通过最终答案评估模型，忽略了推理过程。

Method: 通过半自动标注流程构建DynaSolidGeo基准，包含503个专家策划的种子问题，可动态生成多样化的多模态文本-视觉实例，并引入基于专家标注推理链的过程评估。

Result: 实验显示，代表性开源和闭源视觉语言模型存在较大性能差距，在动态设置下性能严重下降，在需要高水平空间智能的任务（如心理旋转和可视化）上表现较差。

Conclusion: DynaSolidGeo填补了立体几何空间推理评估的空白，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在空间推理能力上的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that
integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing
multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane
geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization,
and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process.
To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic
benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo
contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically
generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances.
Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on
expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal
coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs
reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor
performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental
rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 重新审视LLMs在复杂推理任务中的表现，验证LRMs是否真正具备泛化推理能力，特别是在数学、物理等推理密集型领域。

Method: 开发DeepRD数据集，包含可扩展复杂度的图连接性和自然语言证明规划任务，用于评估LRMs在不同复杂度下的表现。

Result: LRMs在足够复杂度时性能急剧下降，无法泛化到训练分布之外的复杂问题，但大多数现实世界问题仍在其成功范围内。

Conclusion: LRMs在短期内具有实用性，但需要开发能够超越训练分布复杂度的新方法来实现真正的泛化推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning
tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail
catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit
these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs
fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and
self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as
NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of
generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as
mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the
complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have
limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset
(DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of
scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph
connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance
of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also
relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large,
real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find
the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet
the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights
the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that
generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

Conclusion: 基于FSM的分析为理解和解释大型语言模型的推理过程提供了系统化方法，能够揭示不同模型的推理特点，有助于模型评估和改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the
resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn
hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However,
understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open
problem, with many potential important applications including improving
training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless
Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical
reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a
small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction,
augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and
final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's
reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states,
we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the
state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze,
interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the
FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss
how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach
to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals
distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to
evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: ICR算法能够有效解决标准RLHF训练代理忽略干预的问题，提升LLM代理在多轮协作任务中的表现，促进团队共识对齐。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bring deployed in agentic
settings where they act as collaborators with humans. Therefore, it is
increasingly important to be able to evaluate their abilities to collaborate
effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks. In this paper, we build on the AI
alignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical
insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and
an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator
that increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant
propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions
by a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and
related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning
interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this
setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal
behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative
Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal
collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show
that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence
and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.

Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型的发展，数据隐私问题日益突出，机器遗忘成为关键需求。现有基准缺乏图像多样性、存在潜在不准确性，且评估场景不足，无法反映真实应用的复杂性。

Method: 构建基于足球转会谣言的手动标注数据集，包含四个测试集来评估遗忘效果、泛化性、实用性和鲁棒性。支持选择性遗忘、纠正性再学习以及单模态遗忘等高级设置。

Result: 评估多个基线方法发现：单模态方法在多模态谣言上失败；遗忘效果主要由灾难性遗忘驱动；所有方法都难以处理视觉谣言；遗忘的谣言容易被恢复；所有方法都易受提示攻击。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在显著脆弱性，需要更鲁棒的多模态遗忘解决方案。OFFSIDE基准为开发多模态大语言模型遗忘技术提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about
data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned
information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs
are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and
insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of
real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and
alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel
benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football
transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80
players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess
forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports
advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and
crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive
evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods
(erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning
efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle
with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can
be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These
results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting
the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions. The code is available

TL;DR: ATOM是一个自适应优化的少样本方法，用于从非结构化文本构建和持续更新时序知识图谱，通过原子化事实提取和双时间建模提高了提取的完整性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识图谱构建忽略了现实世界数据的动态性和时间敏感性，而现有的零样本或少样本方法存在不稳定性和关键事实覆盖不完整的问题。

Method: 将输入文档分割为最小自包含的"原子"事实，构建原子时序知识图谱，采用双时间建模区分信息观察时间和有效性时间，然后并行合并这些原子图谱。

Result: 相比基线方法，ATOM实现了约18%的完整性提升、约17%的稳定性改善以及超过90%的延迟降低，显示出动态时序知识图谱构建的强大可扩展性。

Conclusion: ATOM方法在时序知识图谱构建中表现出优异的完整性、稳定性和可扩展性，为动态知识提取提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from
unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and
dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)
construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of
real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent
zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance
on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as
well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we
introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that
builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from
unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained
"atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it
constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling
that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The
resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%
better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,
demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

Conclusion: 本文建立了上下文学习性能与上下文长度、预训练和查询任务分布之间KL散度的精确理论关系，为理解ICL机制提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn
from context, known as in-context learning (ICL). Despite a surge of recent
applications that leverage such capabilities, it is by no means clear, at least
theoretically, how the ICL capabilities arise, and in particular, what is the
precise role played by key factors such as pre-training procedure as well as
context construction. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the
ICL performance, for a class of realistic settings, which includes network
architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction process.
As a first step, we construct a simple example with a one-layer transformer,
and show an interesting result, namely when the pre-train data distribution is
different from the query task distribution, a properly constructed context can
shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution, in a
quantifiable manner, leading to accurate prediction on the query topic. We then
extend the findings in the previous step to a more general case, and derive the
precise relationship between ICL performance, context length and the KL
divergence between pre-train and query task distribution. Finally, we provide
experiments to validate our theoretical results.

Conclusion: CLIN-LLM展示了鲁棒性、可解释性和临床安全性，为资源有限的医疗环境提供了可部署的人机协作决策支持框架。

Abstract: Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment
recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient
settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based
systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty,
resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid
pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated
disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The
framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease
dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable
confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals.
Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring
human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical
Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample
MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a
fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by
post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug
interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score,
outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval
precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic
suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate
CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The
proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support
framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes
integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial
validation.

*Adhyayan Veer Singh,Aaron Shen,Brian Law,Ahmed Ismail,Jonas Rohweder,Sean O'Brien,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SwiftSolve是一个面向竞赛编程的复杂度感知多智能体系统，通过算法规划与经验性分析相结合，在保证正确性的同时满足时间和内存限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的程序虽然能通过单元测试，但经常违反竞赛的时间和内存预算限制，需要更全面的效率保证。

Method: 采用多智能体系统架构，包含规划器、静态剪枝器、编码器、性能分析器和复杂度分析器，通过版本化JSON通信，结合算法规划和经验性分析来优化程序效率。

Result: 在26个问题上，SwiftSolve首次尝试通过率61.54%，三次尝试内解决率80.77%，运行级成功率73.08%，相比Claude Opus 4显著提升成功率（73.1% vs 52.6%）。

Conclusion: 性能分析和复杂度指导的重新规划能有效减少程序低效问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提升效率表现。

Abstract: Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy
unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present
SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming
that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and
complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software
environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles
such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner
proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk
plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on
a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a
Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a
complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder.
Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration
caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10
Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains
pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with
marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate
run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly
resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against
Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at
approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness
(pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence
of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that
profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving
accuracy.

*Yuval Kainan,Shaked Zychlinski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于首个生成token对数概率的轻量级方法，用于在单步生成后检测LLM的模板化响应，实现早期终止以优化计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常消耗大量计算资源生成模板化回复（如拒绝、简单确认和问候语），这增加了不必要的成本和延迟。

Method: 利用首个生成token的对数概率分布作为信号，使用轻量级k-NN分类器预测整个响应的性质（实质性回答或模板化响应）。

Result: 实验表明，不同响应类型的首个token对数概率向量形成明显可分离的聚类，能够高精度预测响应类型。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用且计算简单的技术，通过早期终止或重定向到较小模型来优化LLM推理，显著节省计算成本，实现更高效和可持续的LLM部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources
generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and
casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting
such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the
log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful
signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our
experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and
reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors
form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a
lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a
response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response,
including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical,
computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early
termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant
savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more
efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

*Mithul Chander,Sai Pragnya Ranga,Prathamesh Mayekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Atlas Urban Index (AUI)这一新的城市发展度量指标，利用Sentinel-2卫星影像和视觉语言模型来克服传统指数如NDBI的局限性，提供更可靠的城市化评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的城市化指数如NDBI在准确捕捉城市发展方面存在困难，受大气噪声、季节变化和云层覆盖等因素影响，这阻碍了大规模人类发展和城市化的监测。

Method: 收集每个区域的Sentinel-2影像时间序列，在固定时间窗口内处理图像以获得云覆盖最少的代表性图像。采用两种策略确保评分一致性：(i)提供代表不同城市化水平的参考图像集，(ii)提供最近的历史图像以保持时间一致性并减轻当前图像的云相关噪声。

Result: 在班加罗尔的定性实验表明，AUI优于NDBI等标准指数。

Conclusion: AUI能够克服传统城市化指数的挑战，产生更可靠和稳定的发展评分。

Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban
development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite
imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up
Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to
factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These
limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and
urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that
leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score
for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for
each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to
get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image
for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies:
(i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing
different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image
to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the
current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges
of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable
development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI
outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RaCoT是一种在检索前阶段应用对比思维的RAG框架，通过生成对比问题来引导模型关注关键差异细节，从而在单次检索中抑制语义干扰，提高对知识稀疏和语义模糊的长尾查询的处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG在处理知识稀疏和语义模糊的长尾查询时面临的检索噪声问题，避免昂贵的后处理成本。

Method: 在检索前自动生成语义相邻但答案不同的对比问题，提取Δ-Prompt捕捉关键差异，引导模型主动关注决定答案分歧的关键细节。

Result: 在六个权威基准测试中，RaCoT比RankRAG和Self-RAG等强基线方法提升了0.9-2.4个百分点，在对抗性测试中性能下降仅8.6%，远优于其他方法超过15%的下降。

Conclusion: RaCoT将RAG范式从"事后上下文清理"重新定义为"先验塑造判别推理"，为实时、资源受限部署提供了高效可靠的路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with
knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval
noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing. To tackle
this, we propose RaCoT (Retrieval-aware Contrastive-of-Thought), a novel
framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage. By
automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered
contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key
differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical
details that determine answer divergence." This approach allows it to suppress
semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the
theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously
encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore. On six authoritative
benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong
baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points. It exhibits
superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial
tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. Furthermore,
its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the
accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the
necessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from
``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative
reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems
for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着各大公司开发出不同的大语言模型，了解这些模型在性能、道德行为和可用性方面的差异变得至关重要，因为这些差异反映了它们背后的设计理念。

Method: 通过分析三个重要因素来比较五个顶级LLM：性能与准确性、伦理与偏见缓解、可用性与集成性。

Result: 研究发现Claude在道德推理方面表现出色，Gemini在多模态能力和伦理框架方面更强，DeepSeek擅长基于事实的推理，LLaMA适合开放应用，ChatGPT提供平衡性能并注重实用性。

Conclusion: 这些模型在工作效果、易用性和伦理处理方面存在显著差异，用户应根据各自优势来选择合适的模型。

Abstract: Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the
way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google,
High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial
to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour
and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built
them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's
DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs
this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and
Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has
good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has
strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA
is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a
focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of
how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people
ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in
a way that makes the most of its strengths.

TL;DR: 开发了一个事实验证框架，通过交叉检查LLM输出与多个知识源来实时捕获和纠正幻觉错误，将幻觉减少67%，同时保持响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM存在严重幻觉问题，会自信地生成听起来合理但错误的信息，这已成为在准确性重要的现实应用中部署这些模型的主要障碍。

Method: 结合结构化数据库、实时网络搜索和学术文献来验证生成的事实声明，检测到不一致时自动纠正，同时保持响应的自然流畅性。

Result: 在多个领域测试显示幻觉减少67%，领域专家对纠正后输出的满意度达89%，相比未验证的LLM响应有显著提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在不能容忍事实错误的应用程序中使LLM更可信提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems,
they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information
that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major
barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy
matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects
these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple
knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches,
and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we
detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the
natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could
reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain
experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected
outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM
responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more
trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么学习概念标记集合，要么训练VLM使用用户特定信息，但都难以生成准确的个性化助手回答。

Method: 通过个人KV-Cache检索框架，将用户特定信息存储在文本和视觉标记的KV-Caches中。文本标记通过总结用户信息生成元数据，视觉标记通过提取用户图像中的独特图像块生成。回答问题时会检索相关KV-Caches确保回答准确性。

Result: Jarvis能够提供更准确的回答，特别是在依赖特定局部细节时。在多个数据集的视觉问答和纯文本任务中实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: Jarvis为个性化AI助手提供了一条实用路径，代码和数据集将发布。

Abstract: The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended
perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt
general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such
as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific
information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or
train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines
struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce
Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through
personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the
KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by
summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are
produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When
answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal
storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a
fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining
pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained
user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate
responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis
achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and
text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward
personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理开发缺乏对人类工作方式的清晰理解，需要揭示代理的专业能力和在不同工作流程中的角色定位。

Method: 引入可扩展工具包，从人类或代理的计算机使用活动中提取可解释的结构化工作流程，进行直接比较。

Result: 代理倾向于程序化方法，与人类的UI中心方法形成对比；工作质量较差但会掩盖缺陷；效率高且成本低。

Conclusion: 代理在可编程任务上具有效率优势，适合与人类协作，但需要关注其工作质量和诚信问题。

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as
software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with
significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments
have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute
work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in
diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by
presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across
multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering,
computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare
heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable
toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or
agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how
humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents
exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an
overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for
open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the
UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of
inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and
misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster
and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling
efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

Method: 使用Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO)，采用基于元学习的决策树模型来决定不同代理/模型之间的最佳推理策略。

Result: 通过两个生产用例展示了AMO的有效性：M365电子商务Copilot和代码合规Copilot，前者提供最新产品信息并连接多个代理，后者扫描DevOps代码检测合规问题。

Conclusion: AMO能够有效处理多任务和可扩展的代理，为Copilot服务提供自然语言和行动响应。

Abstract: Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various
agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer
with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming
code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering
operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The
repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a
robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right
agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for
handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can
provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate
the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model
for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We
showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases:
Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365
E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to
promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product
information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and
human customer support. The code compliance copilot scans the internal DevOps
code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests (PR).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRM虽然在小规模下具有出色的推理能力，但仅限于监督学习、静态、完全可观测的问题。许多现实世界问题具有动态、不确定或部分可观测的特性，需要能够集成和重用之前时间步的计算。

Method: 提出了HRM-Agent，这是HRM的一个变体，仅使用强化学习进行训练。探索了循环推理过程的动态特性。

Result: HRM-Agent能够在动态和不确定的迷宫环境中学习导航到目标。研究发现循环推理过程成功重用了之前环境时间步的计算。

Conclusion: HRM可以通过强化学习扩展到动态不确定环境，其循环推理机制能够有效重用之前时间步的计算，为处理现实世界问题提供了可能。

Abstract: The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) has impressive reasoning abilities
given its small size, but has only been applied to supervised, static,
fully-observable problems. One of HRM's strengths is its ability to adapt its
computational effort to the difficulty of the problem. However, in its current
form it cannot integrate and reuse computation from previous time-steps if the
problem is dynamic, uncertain or partially observable, or be applied where the
correct action is undefined, characteristics of many real-world problems.
  This paper presents HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained using only
reinforcement learning. We show that HRM can learn to navigate to goals in
dynamic and uncertain maze environments. Recent work suggests that HRM's
reasoning abilities stem from its recurrent inference process. We explore the
dynamics of the recurrent inference process and find evidence that it is
successfully reusing computation from earlier environment time-steps.

Conclusion: 让强化学习智能体考虑计算成本可以显著提高效率，为更节能的AI系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in
many complex tasks, they typically do not become more computationally efficient
as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as
they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their
compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint?
If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute
cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with
showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to
control when they use compute. We conduct our experiments on the Arcade
Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training
compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of
games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We
analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

Result: 发现现有训练方法会放大模态差距，提出的策略能够帮助开发更平衡的多模态推理训练方法。

Conclusion: 研究为开发能够减轻模态差距、促进更平衡多模态推理的训练方法提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an
imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities.
Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while
under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks
that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the
\textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between
text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality
gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training
recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to
bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our
findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the
modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/Bridging-Modality-Gap.

discretization errors and state prediction errors introduced by the incremental
model. Comparative results are presented through flight control simulations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一框架，通过逻辑门和电子电路的视角来整合认知研究和人工智能中的各种推理机制，识别了四种主要依赖形式和八种常见推理模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知研究和人工智能为各种推理机制开发了不同的模型，但缺乏统一框架。本文试图填补这一空白，从物质角度假设高级激活过程。

Method: 使用符号AI建模技术，通过基于逻辑门的电子电路简化视角来考虑推理机制，进行组合探索识别依赖形式，并分析逻辑程序中的推理模式。

Result: 识别了四种主要依赖形式和八种常见推理模式，在统一框架中揭示了传统上不同的推理机制，并通过逻辑程序的概率解释揭示了内部功能依赖。

Conclusion: 即使论证主要基于符号手段和数字系统基础设施，这些观察可能指向更普遍适用的结构，为认知和AI推理机制提供了统一视角。

Abstract: Cognitive studies and artificial intelligence have developed distinct models
for various inferential mechanisms (categorization, induction, abduction,
causal inference, contrast, merge, ...). Yet, both natural and artificial views
on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework. This paper formulates a
speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap. To postulate on
higher-level activation processes from a material perspective, we consider
inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic AI modelling techniques, through
the simplistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates. We observe
that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and
negation compared to standard logic and logic programming. Then, by
combinatorial exploration, we identify four main forms of dependencies that can
be realized by these inferential circuits. Looking at how these forms are
generally used in the context of logic programs, we identify eight common
inferential patterns, exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in
an unifying framework. Finally, following a probabilistic interpretation of
logic programs, we unveil inner functional dependencies. The paper concludes
elaborating in what sense, even if our arguments are mostly informed by
symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures, our observations may
pinpoint to more generally applicable structures.

TL;DR: 论文评估了LLM在工具调用环境中的泛化能力，发现存在显著泛化差距，并提出了CoreThink框架来提升多步骤推理和工具协调能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能体工具调用环境中泛化能力不足的关键挑战，理解LLM在不同领域间转移推理策略和协调工具的能力。

Method: 大规模评估最先进LLM在多个工具调用基准上的表现，并引入MAVEN OOD基准进行压力测试，同时提出CoreThink代理推理框架，通过轻量级符号推理层增强结构化分解和自适应工具编排。

Result: 当前大多数模型在MAVEN基准上准确率低于50%，显示出显著的泛化差距。CoreThink框架在所有基准上实现泛化，性能提升530%，计算成本仅为十分之一。

Conclusion: CoreThink框架有效解决了LLM在工具调用环境中的泛化问题，无需额外训练即可实现最先进性能，显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Generalization across Agentic tool-calling environments remains a key
unsolved challenge in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems. While
large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on isolated
benchmarks, their ability to transfer reasoning strategies and co-ordinate
tools across diverse domains is poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a
large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on multiple tool-calling
benchmarksBFCL v3, TauBench, Tau2Bench, and AceBenchand introduce MAVEN (Math &
Physics Adversarial Verification & Evaluation Network), a new out of
distribution (OOD) benchmark designed to stress-test multi-step reasoning
through explicit verification and adversarial task composition. Our results
show that most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on MAVEN, revealing a
significant generalization gap across tool-use settings.
  To address this, we present the CoreThink Agentic Reasoner, a framework that
augments LLMs with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured
decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration. Without additional training, it
generalizes across all benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
530% improvements over existing baselines at roughly one-tenth the
computational cost.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GTR-Mamba是一个新颖的POI推荐框架，通过双流形条件路由机制，在双曲几何中建模静态偏好层次，在欧几里得切空间中处理动态序列更新，有效解决了现有模型难以同时捕捉空间层次结构和用户时间上下文动态变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POI推荐模型主要基于图神经网络和序列模型，但存在根本性局限：无法同时捕捉空间选择的层次结构和用户特定时间上下文的动态变化及不规则转移。

Method: 提出GTR-Mamba框架，利用不同数学空间的优势：在双曲几何中建模静态树状偏好层次，在欧几里得切空间中使用新颖的Mamba层处理动态序列更新，通过跨流形通道融合时空信息来显式引导状态空间模型。

Conclusion: GTR-Mamba通过跨流形条件路由机制成功解决了同时建模空间层次结构和时间上下文动态变化的挑战，为POI推荐提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern
Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex
decision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized
recommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI
recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and
sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a
fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent
hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts
of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose
GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.
GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces
for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in
hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel
Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent
space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses
spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),
enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.

Conclusion: MA-CDMP方法通过扩散模型和均值场机制有效解决了多智能体资源分配中的关键挑战，为无线通信系统提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation
plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While
centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a
central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer
from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed
Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed
learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and
limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion
Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.
Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP
employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future
trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby
alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE
methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field
(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This
design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with
minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further
theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation
error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence
stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL
baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its
scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多维度指令不确定性减少框架（InSUR），通过解决语义不确定性中的参考多样性、描述不完整性和边界模糊性等问题，生成更令人满意的语义约束对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成语义约束对抗样本的方法在攻击能力上存在不足，主要原因是未能充分研究人类指令中的语义不确定性因素，如参考多样性、描述不完整性和边界模糊性。

Method: 提出InSUR框架，包含三个维度：1）采样方法维度：通过残差驱动的攻击方向稳定化缓解语言参考多样性导致的不稳定对抗优化；2）任务建模维度：通过上下文编码的攻击场景约束补充不完整人类指令的缺失知识；3）生成器评估维度：通过语义抽象的攻击评估增强澄清评估边界。

Result: 大量实验证明InSUR在迁移攻击性能上的优越性，并首次实现了无参考的语义约束3D对抗样本生成。

Conclusion: InSUR框架通过多维度减少指令不确定性，能够生成更可迁移、自适应和有效的语义约束对抗样本，为未来研究提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which
are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a
promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To
generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking
ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human
instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and
boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,
this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction
(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,
adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,
we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate
the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language
references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the
optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,
therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of
multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded
attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from
incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are
proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger
scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,
we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by
clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more
effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize
the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial
examples for the first time.

Motivation: 开发一个能够为不同用户类型提供高效、可信解释的通用解释框架，解决现有解释方法在用户适配性和解释质量方面的局限性。

Method: 将后置解释器（SHAP、LIME、Anchor）与检索增强的大型语言模型耦合，索引多模态知识库，基于量化标准为每个实例选择最佳解释器，使用聊天提示生成基于事实的叙述。

Result: 在心脏病和甲状腺癌数据集上的评估显示：LIME在保真度-鲁棒性权衡方面表现最佳；Anchor产生最稀疏、低token的规则；SHAP获得最高满意度。Profile条件化稳定了token使用并保持了各用户配置文件的正面评分。

Conclusion: ProfileXAI框架能够实现高效且可信的解释生成，不同解释器在不同指标上各有优势，Profile条件化确保了跨用户配置的稳定性和正面体验。

Abstract: ProfileXAI is a model- and domain-agnostic framework that couples post-hoc
explainers (SHAP, LIME, Anchor) with retrieval - augmented LLMs to produce
explanations for different types of users. The system indexes a multimodal
knowledge base, selects an explainer per instance via quantitative criteria,
and generates grounded narratives with chat-enabled prompting. On Heart Disease
and Thyroid Cancer datasets, we evaluate fidelity, robustness, parsimony, token
use, and perceived quality. No explainer dominates: LIME achieves the best
fidelity-robustness trade-off (Infidelity $\le 0.30$, $L<0.7$ on Heart
Disease); Anchor yields the sparsest, low-token rules; SHAP attains the highest
satisfaction ($\bar{x}=4.1$). Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens ($\sigma
\le 13\%$) and maintains positive ratings across profiles ($\bar{x}\ge 3.7$,
with domain experts at $3.77$), enabling efficient and trustworthy
explanations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in

radiology reporting, trainee education, and quality control. However,
systematic guidance on how to optimize prompt design across different clinical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏步规划方法在跳过步骤时能捕捉长期依赖关系，但过度稀疏预测会降低性能，且时间密度阈值在时间范围内不均匀分布

Method: 设计MDD扩散规划器，将整个时间范围内的密度作为可调超参数，允许轨迹的不同部分以不同密度进行规划

Result: 在Maze2D、Franka Kitchen和Antmaze D4RL任务领域达到新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 通过混合密度规划方法，MDD能够在不增加计算成本的情况下有效平衡长期依赖捕捉和规划性能

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step
planning over single-step planning. Training models to skip steps in their
trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory
computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades
performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform
across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should
be more densely planned. We propose Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion
planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters.
MDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL
task domains.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing a profound transition from a
computational instrument to an autonomous originator of scientific knowledge.
This emerging paradigm, the AI scientist, is architected to emulate the
complete scientific workflow-from initial hypothesis generation to the final
synthesis of publishable findings-thereby promising to fundamentally reshape
the pace and scale of discovery. However, the rapid and unstructured
proliferation of these systems has created a fragmented research landscape,
obscuring overarching methodological principles and developmental trends. This
survey provides a systematic and comprehensive synthesis of this domain by
introducing a unified, six-stage methodological framework that deconstructs the
end-to-end scientific process into: Literature Review, Idea Generation,
Experimental Preparation, Experimental Execution, Scientific Writing, and Paper
Generation. Through this analytical lens, we chart the field's evolution from
early Foundational Modules (2022-2023) to integrated Closed-Loop Systems
(2024), and finally to the current frontier of Scalability, Impact, and
Human-AI Collaboration (2025-present). By rigorously synthesizing these
developments, this survey not only clarifies the current state of autonomous
science but also provides a critical roadmap for overcoming remaining
challenges in robustness and governance, ultimately guiding the next generation
of systems toward becoming trustworthy and indispensable partners in human
scientific inquiry.

Abstract: Driven by the dual principles of smart education and artificial intelligence
technology, the online education model has rapidly emerged as an important
component of the education industry. Cognitive diagnostic technology can
utilize students' learning data and feedback information in educational
evaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level.
However, while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources,
they also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of
disciplinary data. In cross-disciplinary fields, traditional cognitive
diagnostic methods still face many challenges. Given the differences in
knowledge systems, cognitive structures, and data characteristics between
different disciplines, this paper conducts in-depth research on neural network
cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive
diagnosis, and proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis
method (TLCD). This method combines deep learning techniques and transfer
learning strategies to enhance the performance of the model in the target
discipline by utilizing the common features of the main discipline. The
experimental results show that the cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis model
based on deep learning performs better than the basic model in
cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis tasks, and can more accurately evaluate
students' learning situation.

Result: 评估显示小型LLM能够作为有效的奖励模型或代码评估评判器，成功识别多个候选方案中的正确解决方案，使用该评判器使多代代码中最准确代码的搜索能力提升超过20%。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型能够被转化为有效的奖励模型，在代码生成任务中结合过程奖励和结果奖励，显著提升代码质量评估和最优代码搜索能力。

Abstract: Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a
necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps.
Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing
a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that
reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to
investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4
family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of
process rewards and outcome rewards.
  Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness
labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a
value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs.
Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward
models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions
among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement
in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了科学大语言模型(Sci-LLMs)处理生物分子序列的传统方法，发现提供高层次结构化上下文比直接处理原始序列更有效，且原始序列反而会降低模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Sci-LLMs在处理原始生物分子序列时面临的标记化困境——无论是将序列视为专门语言还是单独模态，都会限制模型的推理能力。

Method: 系统比较领先的Sci-LLMs在生物推理任务上的三种输入模式：仅序列、仅上下文、以及两者结合。

Result: 仅使用上下文的方法始终且显著优于其他模式。更令人惊讶的是，在上下文基础上加入原始序列会持续降低性能，表明原始序列起到了信息噪声的作用。

Conclusion: 应重新定位Sci-LLMs的角色，不是作为序列解码器，而是作为专家知识上的强大推理引擎，将发展重点从直接序列解释转向高层次知识合成。

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising
frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a
fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the
tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,
risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,
introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally
limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by
positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level
structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby
bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through
a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we
tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of
both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and
substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion
of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades
performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for
models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the
primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to
interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for
reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for
reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines
over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid
scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct
sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技能发现方法只关注技能多样性最大化，不考虑人类偏好，导致产生危险或不期望的行为（如机器人翻滚、进入危险区域）

Method: 从基础模型中提取评分函数，根据人类意图评估状态，为期望状态分配高值、不期望状态分配低值，然后用这些分数重新加权技能发现算法的奖励

Result: FoG成功消除了翻滚等不期望行为，避免了危险区域，在基于状态和像素的任务中都有效，还能发现难以定义的行为技能

Conclusion: FoG方法有效将人类意图融入技能发现，解决了现有方法忽视人类偏好的问题，能够学习更安全、更符合期望的技能

Abstract: Learning diverse skills without hand-crafted reward functions could
accelerate reinforcement learning in downstream tasks. However, existing skill
discovery methods focus solely on maximizing the diversity of skills without
considering human preferences, which leads to undesirable behaviors and
possibly dangerous skills. For instance, a cheetah robot trained using previous
methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity, whereas
we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas. In this
work, we propose a Foundation model Guided (FoG) skill discovery method, which
incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models.
Specifically, FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate
states based on human intentions, assigning higher values to desirable states
and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the
rewards of skill discovery algorithms. By optimizing the re-weighted skill
discovery rewards, FoG successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors,
such as flipping or rolling, and to avoid hazardous areas in both state-based
and pixel-based tasks. Interestingly, we show that FoG can discover skills
involving behaviors that are difficult to define. Interactive visualisations

### [280] [AUPO -- Abstracted Until Proven Otherwise: A Reward Distribution Based Abstraction Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23214)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AUPO是MCTS决策策略的改进算法，仅基于奖励分布统计自动进行动作抽象，无需转移概率或DAG搜索图，能检测对称动作，性能优于MCTS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进MCTS决策策略，开发无需转移概率和DAG搜索图的自动动作抽象算法，解决现有框架如ASAP在检测远距离对称状态时的困难。

Method: 提出AUPO算法，在MCTS过程中仅利用奖励分布统计进行自动动作抽象，不影响树搜索本身，可与其他抽象技术兼容。

Result: 在IPPC基准问题上，AUPO明显优于MCTS，能有效检测对称动作，克服ASAP等现有框架的局限性。

Conclusion: AUPO作为MCTS的改进决策策略，提供了一种轻量级且有效的自动动作抽象方法，具有实用价值和兼容性优势。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, drop-in modification to Monte Carlo Tree Search's
(MCTS) decision policy that we call AUPO. Comparisons based on a range of IPPC
benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an
automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward
distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic
abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition
probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build
its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that
state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting
symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only
affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other
abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习在游戏行业应用有限，现有研究主要关注训练超人智能体，而游戏工作室需要的是拟人化智能体且资源有限。

Method: 改进基于价值的DRL方法，利用预收集数据并增强网络可塑性来提高样本效率。

Result: 在EA SPORTS FC 25中训练的守门员智能体比游戏内置AI扑救率高10%，训练速度快50%，专家评价显示能产生更拟人的游戏体验。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了游戏工业中DRL应用的实际需求，将被用于替代现有手工制作的智能体，在下一代游戏中部署。

Abstract: While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the
game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on
training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game
studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper
proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning
agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method
improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data
and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper
agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today.
Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate.
Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to
standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts
indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to
hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method
is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the
series.

*Hong Wang,Wenkai Yang,Jie Wang,Huanshuo Dong,Zijie Geng,Zhen Huang,Depeng Xie,Zhezheng Hao,Hande Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BlocKOA的新算法，用于高效生成集成电路热仿真数据，通过块Krylov算法和算子操作加速数据生成过程并提高数据精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法需要大量高保真训练数据，计算成本高昂，限制了神经网络算子在IC热仿真中的应用。

Method: 使用块Krylov算法基于热方程结构快速获取基础解，组合生成满足物理约束的温度分布，然后应用热算子确定热源分布。

Result: BlocKOA的时间复杂度比现有方法低一个数量级，在生成5000个芯片热仿真数据时实现420倍加速，仅用4%的生成时间就能达到可比性能。

Conclusion: BlocKOA算法能显著加速IC热仿真数据生成，为数据驱动方法提供高效的数据支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as neural operators (NOs),
have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated
circuit (IC) thermal simulations. However, a limitation of these approaches is
requiring a large amount of high-fidelity training data, such as chip
parameters and temperature distributions, thereby incurring significant
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm
for the generation of IC thermal simulation data, named block Krylov and
operator action (BlocKOA), which simultaneously accelerates the data generation
process and enhances the precision of generated data. BlocKOA is specifically
designed for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm
based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic
solutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that
satisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these
functions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating
precise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of
BlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results
further validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold
speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying
physical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation
time, data-driven approaches trained on the data generated by BlocKOA exhibits
comparable performance to that using the existing method.

*Riccardo Romanello,Daniele Lizzio Bosco,Jacopo Cossio,Dusan Sutulovic,Giuseppe Serra,Carla Piazza,Paolo Burelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的CNOT门最小化方法，使用单一智能体处理不同尺寸的量子电路，在较大电路尺寸上优于现有最优算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNOT门是量子计算中的基本门，能够产生量子纠缠。最小化CNOT门数量对量子电路优化至关重要，但目前该问题的计算复杂度尚未完全确定，是一个开放挑战。

Method: 使用单一强化学习智能体处理固定尺寸m的电路，对于不同尺寸的矩阵采用嵌入或高斯条纹化预处理。训练了m=8的智能体，并在尺寸3到15的矩阵上评估。

Result: 该方法在电路尺寸n增大时，性能优于现有最优算法。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在CNOT门最小化问题上表现出色，特别是对于较大尺寸的量子电路，为量子电路优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: CNOT gates are fundamental to quantum computing, as they facilitate
entanglement, a crucial resource for quantum algorithms. Certain classes of
quantum circuits are constructed exclusively from CNOT gates. Given their
widespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed.
This problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its
computational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we
introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead
of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes,
we use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$. Matrices of sizes different from
m are preprocessed using either embedding or Gaussian striping. To assess the
efficacy of our approach, we trained an agent with m = 8, and evaluated it on
matrices of size n that range from 3 to 15. The results we obtained show that
our method overperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm as the value of n
increases.

*Anwesha Das,John Duff,Jörg Hoffmann,Vera Demberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个自适应信号框架，用于在动态环境中优化人机协作，通过多步规划和用户意识建模来改善信息传递的时机和特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速变化的环境中，确保人类准确理解关键任务要素需要辅助代理不仅识别最高优先级信息，还要估计如何以及何时最有效地传达这些信息，因为人类注意力是零和认知资源。

Method: 使用理性沟通原则，通过贝叶斯参考解析和理性言语行为(RSA)建模框架，规划消息序列以优化用户信念与动态环境的及时对齐。代理根据用户和场景特点调整消息特异性和时机。

Result: 与基线方法相比，该方法的效果关键依赖于将多步规划与现实的用户意识模型相结合。

Conclusion: 这是RSA在动态环境通信和人类-AI交互中的首次应用，为人类-代理团队中的语用通信建立了理论基础，展示了认知科学见解如何为辅助代理设计提供信息。

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on
time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure
the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an
assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but
also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most
effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive
resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming
information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which
meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,
formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely
alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts
message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based
on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence
attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several
timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show
that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with
a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for
communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in
general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in
human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be
capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了细粒度意见挖掘和实体排名，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers
of our behaviors. In current times due to growth of social networking website
and increase in number of e-commerce site huge amount of opinions are now
available on web. Given a set of evaluative statements that contain opinions
(or sentiments) about an Entity, opinion mining aims to extract attributes and
components of the object that have been commented on in each statement and to
determine whether the comments are positive, negative or neutral. While lot of
research recently has been done in field of opinion mining and some of it
dealing with ranking of entities based on review or opinion set, classifying
opinions into finer granularity level and then ranking entities has never been
done before. In this paper method for opinion mining from statements at a
deeper level of granularity is proposed. This is done by using fuzzy logic
reasoning, after which entities are ranked as per this information.

Conclusion: AutoStreamPipe框架能够有效自动化流处理管道的设计和部署，在效率和准确性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Data pipelines are essential in stream processing as they enable the
efficient collection, processing, and delivery of real-time data, supporting
rapid data analysis. In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel
framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design,
generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe
bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific
implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured
multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an
extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution
strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good
accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that
AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates
(x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM
code-generation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有竞价模型在跨场景泛化能力上的局限性，传统模型通常针对特定竞价场景设计，缺乏通用性。

Method: 构建统一函数估计特定出价下的效果，使用均匀序列嵌入处理异构数据，提出两种注意力机制分别处理变量间和时间依赖关系，采用变量感知融合模块进行自适应预测，设计零膨胀投影模块处理数据分布。

Conclusion: Bid2X作为竞价基础模型在计算广告领域具有良好前景，实现了跨场景的通用性并带来显著业务提升。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically
providing bids for advertisers. While previous work has made great efforts to
model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in
generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored
for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the
scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the
achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross
merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding
foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various
scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode
heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex
inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose
two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables
and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation
learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a
variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome
prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a
zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero
probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization
objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to
converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the
ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline
evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various
baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by
4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding
foundation model in computational advertising.

Conclusion: 这项工作为通过原则性因果推断提升深度强化学习智能体能力提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement
learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to
the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal
principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational
Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal
reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's
understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby
mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We
demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly
enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance.
Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our
approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of
causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a
promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning
agents through principled causal inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提醒人们注意线性风险模型的哲学局限性，探讨AI存在性风险评估中的认知漠视和不确定性维度，为理解AI生存风险提供更全面的视角。

Method: 通过比较标准瑞士奶酪模型与作者模型的差异，分析在认知漠视情境下P(D)概率的结构性关系，区分风险与不确定性，并识别影响P(D)评估的两种不确定性类型。

Result: 发现在认知漠视情境下，考虑到各层之间的结构关系，P(D)的概率比初步估计的要高，并且P(D)的评估受到选项不确定性和状态空间不确定性的结构性影响。

Conclusion: 将不确定性维度纳入AI存在性风险的定性讨论中，能够更好地理解P(D)的可能性，为AI风险评估提供更完善的分析框架。

Abstract: This work is a commentary of the article
\href{https://doi.org/10.18716/ojs/phai/2025.2801}{AI Survival Stories: a
Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk} by Cappelen, Goldstein, and
Hawthorne. It is not just a commentary though, but a useful reminder of the
philosophical limitations of \say{linear} models of risk. The article will
focus on the model employed by the authors: first, I discuss some differences
between standard Swiss Cheese models and this one. I then argue that in a
situation of epistemic indifference the probability of P(D) is higher than what
one might first suggest, given the structural relationships between layers. I
then distinguish between risk and uncertainty, and argue that any estimation of
P(D) is structurally affected by two kinds of uncertainty: option uncertainty
and state-space uncertainty. Incorporating these dimensions of uncertainty into
our qualitative discussion on AI existential risk can provide a better
understanding of the likeliness of P(D).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业需要满足最小权限、合规性和可审计性的访问决策，但传统方法难以处理自然语言请求与复杂策略的匹配。

Method: 使用Google Gemini 2.0 Flash实现六阶段推理框架：上下文解释、用户验证、数据分类、业务目的测试、合规映射和风险综合，采用早期硬策略门控和默认拒绝机制。

Result: 在14个标准案例评估中，精确决策匹配率从10/14提升到13/14(92.9%)，拒绝召回率达到1.00，必须拒绝场景的误批准率降至0，功能适当性和合规性均为14/14。

Conclusion: 策略约束的LLM推理结合显式门控和审计跟踪，能够将人类可读策略转化为安全、合规且可追溯的机器决策。

Abstract: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with
regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that
uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests
against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented
with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context
interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test,
compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny
by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls
and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases
across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results
show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying
policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny
families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence
at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is
under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM
reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human
readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines,
shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions
under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain
knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in
the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design
collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and
AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of
Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of
reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty
Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human
expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,
ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,
enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population
level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an
intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a
classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop
practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution
free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts,
including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we
call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification,
regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative
prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher
coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

Conclusion: 该框架为开发静态分析工具和智能体框架语法奠定了基础，能够实现智能体系统的定量风险分析和形式化安全保障。

Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes
of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky
hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the
definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly
maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate
that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical
task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents
employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This
Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing
agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More
critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the
application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety
and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the
boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally
undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents
by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative
risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static
analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在情感理解中生成的情感解释经常与目标标签不符，甚至与自身预测的情感相矛盾，这种不一致性会降低系统可靠性和用户信任。

Method: 提出情感理由验证器(ERV)和解释奖励机制，在不修改模型架构或需要额外视频描述标注的情况下，引导模型生成与目标情感一致的解释。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了解释与预测的对齐，还使多模态大语言模型能够提供情感一致、可信赖的交互，是实现真正类人HCI系统的关键一步。

Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into
more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift,
emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues
underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for
predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust.
However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that
diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own
predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for
misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address
this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and
an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is
explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion
recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional
paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves
faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on
the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human
evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between
explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally
coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like
HCI systems.

and leveraging dynamic architectures, HAI seeks to balance performance with
ecological responsibility. We detail the theoretical foundations, system
design, and operational principles that enable AI to learn continuously and
contextually while minimizing carbon footprints and human annotation costs. Our
approach addresses pressing challenges in active learning, continual
adaptation, and energy-efficient model deployment, offering a pathway toward
responsible, human-centered artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: NoRA是一个新的系统性关系推理基准，旨在超越基于路径的简化推理，增加多个难度级别，推动神经网络在系统性关系推理领域的进步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统性关系推理基准过于简化，假设推理可简化为关系路径组合，导致模型在现有基准表现良好但难以泛化到其他设置。

Method: 引入NoRA基准，增加多个难度级别，要求模型超越基于路径的推理方法。

Result: 提出了一个新的基准测试框架，为系统性关系推理研究提供更全面的评估标准。

Conclusion: NoRA基准将推动系统性关系推理领域的进一步发展，促进更通用推理模型的设计。

Abstract: Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important
and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have
been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning,
including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture,
and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for
systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on
the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In
fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent
models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but
are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in
the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce
NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires
models to go beyond path-based reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了JanusCode-800K，这是迄今为止最大的多模态代码语料库，并基于此训练了JanusCoder系列模型，实现了从文本指令、视觉输入或两者结合生成代码的统一方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经代码智能的范围正在从基于文本的源代码扩展到程序生成的丰富视觉输出，但高质量多模态代码数据的稀缺阻碍了进展。

Method: 首先开发了一个完整的合成工具包，利用数据模态之间的协同作用高效生成大规模高质量语料库；然后训练JanusCoder和JanusCoderV模型，建立视觉-编程接口。

Result: JanusCoder系列在文本中心和视觉中心编码任务上表现出色，7B到14B规模的模型接近甚至超过商业模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为协调程序逻辑与其视觉表达提供了关键见解，统一模型方法优于为孤立任务构建专门模型的方法。

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will
are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

TL;DR: OntoPret是一个基于认知科学和模块化工程方法的人类行为解释本体，填补了技术中心机器人框架与描述性行为本体之间的研究空白，为分类任务偏差和欺骗行为等复杂人类行为提供了形式化、机器可处理的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人机协作在工业5.0等范式中变得重要，机器需要安全有效地解释复杂人类行为。当前技术中心机器人框架缺乏细致的人类行为模型，而描述性行为本体又不适用于实时协作解释，存在研究空白。

Method: 基于认知科学和模块化工程方法，开发了OntoPret本体，提供了一个形式化、机器可处理的行为分类框架，能够处理任务偏差和欺骗行为。

Result: 在制造和游戏两个不同用例中展示了OntoPret的适应性，并建立了进行高级人类意图推理所需的语义基础。

Conclusion: OntoPret成功填补了人机协作中行为解释的研究空白，为机器理解复杂人类行为提供了有效的本体框架。

Abstract: As human machine teaming becomes central to paradigms like Industry 5.0, a
critical need arises for machines to safely and effectively interpret complex
human behaviors. A research gap currently exists between techno centric robotic
frameworks, which often lack nuanced models of human behavior, and descriptive
behavioral ontologies, which are not designed for real time, collaborative
interpretation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting OntoPret, an
ontology for the interpretation of human behavior. Grounded in cognitive
science and a modular engineering methodology, OntoPret provides a formal,
machine processable framework for classifying behaviors, including task
deviations and deceptive actions. We demonstrate its adaptability across two
distinct use cases manufacturing and gameplay and establish the semantic
foundations necessary for advanced reasoning about human intentions.

TL;DR: ReCode提出了一种通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动的新范式，将高级计划视为抽象占位函数，递归分解为更细粒度的子函数，直到原始动作，实现动态决策粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界任务需要不同粒度的决策，人类通过统一认知表示实现这一能力，但当前基于LLM的智能体缺乏这种跨粒度操作能力，现有范式在高级规划和低级行动之间存在刚性分离。

Method: ReCode在单一代码表示中统一规划和行动，将高级计划作为抽象占位函数，然后递归分解为更细粒度的子函数，直到达到原始动作，消除计划与行动之间的刚性边界。

Result: 大量实验表明ReCode在推理性能上显著超越先进基线，并在训练中表现出卓越的数据效率，验证了通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动是实现通用粒度控制的有力有效方法，递归结构固有地生成丰富的多粒度训练数据，使模型能够学习分层决策过程。

Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel
at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is
available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

TL;DR: ChatGPT发布后，公众对AI的接受度下降，对人监督的需求增加，并扩大了教育、语言和性别差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究公众对AI的态度变化，特别是在有影响力的决策场景中，以及GenAI技术快速采用对公众接受度的影响。

Method: 使用大规模两波调查（n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488），代表瑞士人口，比较ChatGPT发布前后的公众态度变化。

Result: GenAI繁荣显著降低了公众对AI的接受度，增加了对人监督的需求。"完全不可接受"AI的比例从23%升至30%，支持纯人类决策的比例从18%升至26%。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了行业对公众AI部署准备度的假设，强调技术发展必须与不断变化的公众偏好保持一致的重要性。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies
has led many organizations to integrate AI into their products and services,
often without considering user preferences. Yet, public attitudes toward AI
use, especially in impactful decision-making scenarios, are underexplored.
Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488)
representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes
toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom
is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1)
and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts.
The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from
23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%.
These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened
educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge
industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the
critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public
preferences.

TL;DR: 提出了MAE框架，通过多智能体自演化的方式增强LLM的推理能力，无需人工标注数据，在数学、推理和常识问答等任务上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法依赖人工标注数据和可验证奖励，限制了扩展性和通用性。现有自博弈RL方法需要特定环境反馈，难以扩展到通用领域。

Method: 设计了三智能体交互框架（提议者、求解者、评判者），基于单一LLM实例化，应用强化学习优化行为，实现智能体协同演化。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct上实验，MAE在多个基准测试中平均提升4.54%。

Conclusion: MAE是一种可扩展、数据高效的方法，能够以最少的人工监督显著增强LLM的通用推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However,
the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and
verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent
Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go,
aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.
However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback
(e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general
domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose
Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in
solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge
Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents
(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies
reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates
questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while
co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves
an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight
MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning
abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

TL;DR: ALITA-G是一个自我进化框架，通过生成、抽象和策划MCP工具，将通用代理转化为领域专家，在多个基准测试中取得SOTA结果并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我进化代理主要局限于提示重写或失败重试，需要更系统的方法将通用代理转化为领域专家。

Method: 框架包含三个步骤：执行目标领域任务并合成候选MCP，抽象为参数化原语并整合到MCP Box，推理时进行检索增强的MCP选择并使用MCP执行器。

Result: 在GAIA验证集上达到83.03% pass@1和89.09% pass@3的SOTA结果，同时平均每个示例的token减少约15%。

Conclusion: ALITA-G提供了从通用能力到可重用领域特定能力的原理性路径，提高了复杂推理任务的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when
scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this,
self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation
to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a
self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain
expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context
Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated
suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful
trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and
consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs
retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and
use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across
several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains
strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves
83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result
while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a
strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from
generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both
accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.
