### [1] [Global sonde datasets do not support a mesoscale transition in the turbulent energy cascade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23625)
*Thomas D. DeWitt,Timothy J. Garrett*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 传统大气动力学模型假设不同空间尺度由不同机制主导，但观测数据显示大气湍流能谱不存在明显的尺度间断，而是支持Lovejoy-Schertzer分层湍流模型，即所有尺度都遵循单一的各向异性湍流级联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统大气动力学中关于不同空间尺度由不同机制（准二维地转湍流、重力波、三维各向同性湍流）主导的层级模型，通过实际观测数据验证理论预测的尺度间断是否存在。

Method: 使用全球探空仪和无线电探空仪数据集，计算水平风在垂直分离（200米至8公里）和水平分离（200公里至1800公里）上的结构函数和赫斯特指数。

Result: 垂直分离的赫斯特指数Hv≈0.6，不符合重力波（Hv=1）或3D湍流（Hv=1/3）的预测；水平分离的赫斯特指数Hh≈0.4，不符合准地转动力学（Hh=1）的预测。观测结果与Lovejoy-Schertzer分层湍流模型（Hv=3/5，Hh=1/3）最为一致。

Conclusion: 大气动力学更符合单一的各向异性湍流级联模型，而非传统的多机制层级模型，这为描述大气动力学提供了更统一的理论框架。

Abstract: Conceptual and theoretical models describing the dynamics of the atmosphere
often assume a hierarchy of dynamic regimes, each operating over some limited
range of spatial scales. The largest scales are presumed to be governed by
quasi-two-dimensional geostrophic turbulence, mesoscale dynamics by gravity
waves, and the smallest scales by 3D isotropic turbulence. In theory, this
hierarchy should be observable as clear scale breaks in turbulent kinetic
energy spectra as one physical mechanism transitions to the next. Here, we show
that this view is not supported by global dropsonde and radiosonde datasets of
horizontal winds. Instead, the structure function for horizontal wind
calculated for vertical separations between 200 m and 8 km has a Hurst exponent
of $H_v \approx 0.6$, which is inconsistent with either gravity waves ($H_v =
1$) or 3D turbulence ($H_v = 1/3$). For horizontal separations between 200 km
and 1800 km, the Hurst exponent is $H_h \approx 0.4$, which is inconsistent
with quasi-geostrophic dynamics ($H_h = 1$). We argue that sonde observations
are most consistent with a lesser known "Lovejoy-Schertzer" model for
stratified turbulence where, at all scales, the dynamics of the atmosphere obey
a single anisotropic turbulent cascade with $H_v=3/5$ and $H_h =1/3$. While
separation scales smaller than 200 m are not explored here due to measurement
limitations, the analysis nonetheless supports a single cohesive theoretical
framework for describing atmospheric dynamics, one that might substitute for
the more traditional hierarchy of mechanisms that depends on spatial scale.

Result: 建立了结合因果分析和概率预测的综合框架，提高了北极海洋环境降水预测的可靠性和可解释性

Conclusion: 综合因果分析与概率预测的框架对增强北极海洋环境降水预测的可靠性和可解释性具有重要意义

Abstract: Understanding and forecasting precipitation events in the Arctic maritime
environments, such as Bear Island and Ny-{\AA}lesund, is crucial for assessing
climate risk and developing early warning systems in vulnerable marine regions.
This study proposes a probabilistic machine learning framework for modeling and
predicting the dynamics and severity of precipitation. We begin by analyzing
the scale-dependent relationships between precipitation and key atmospheric
drivers (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, cloud cover, and air pressure)
using wavelet coherence, which captures localized dependencies across time and
frequency domains. To assess joint causal influences, we employ
Synergistic-Unique-Redundant Decomposition, which quantifies the impact of
interaction effects among each variable on future precipitation dynamics. These
insights inform the development of data-driven forecasting models that
incorporate both historical precipitation and causal climate drivers. To
account for uncertainty, we employ the conformal prediction method, which
enables the generation of calibrated non-parametric prediction intervals. Our
results underscore the importance of utilizing a comprehensive framework that
combines causal analysis with probabilistic forecasting to enhance the
reliability and interpretability of precipitation predictions in Arctic marine
environments.

### [3] [Connectome-Guided Automatic Learning Rates for Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23781)
*Peilin He,Tananun Songdechakraiwut*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种受脑连接组启发的自适应学习率方法(CG-ALR)，通过动态构建神经网络的功能连接组来在线调整学习率，优于传统SGD调度和近期方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脑具有高度适应性，其功能连接在认知和学习过程中会动态重构，而人工神经网络通常依赖手动调整的学习率调度或超参数固定的自适应优化器。

Method: CG-ALR方法在每个训练迭代中从神经元共激活动态构建神经网络的功能连接组，并根据连接组重构情况在线调整学习率。

Result: 该方法能够根据网络的动态功能组织调整步长，在不稳定重构时减慢学习，在稳定组织出现时加速学习。

Conclusion: 受脑连接组启发的原理可以为深度学习中的自适应学习率设计提供信息，通常优于传统的SGD调度和近期方法。

Abstract: The human brain is highly adaptive: its functional connectivity reconfigures
on multiple timescales during cognition and learning, enabling flexible
information processing. By contrast, artificial neural networks typically rely
on manually-tuned learning-rate schedules or generic adaptive optimizers whose
hyperparameters remain largely agnostic to a model's internal dynamics. In this
paper, we propose Connectome-Guided Automatic Learning Rate (CG-ALR) that
dynamically constructs a functional connectome of the neural network from
neuron co-activations at each training iteration and adjusts learning rates
online as this connectome reconfigures. This connectomics-inspired mechanism
adapts step sizes to the network's dynamic functional organization, slowing
learning during unstable reconfiguration and accelerating it when stable
organization emerges. Our results demonstrate that principles inspired by brain
connectomes can inform the design of adaptive learning rates in deep learning,
generally outperforming traditional SGD-based schedules and recent methods.

### [4] [All in one timestep: Enhancing Sparsity and Energy efficiency in Multi-level Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24637)
*Andrea Castagnetti,Alain Pegatoquet,Benoît Miramond*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出多级脉冲神经元模型，在降低量化误差和推理延迟的同时接近全精度ANN性能，并设计Sparse-ResNet架构解决脉冲雪崩效应，在图像分类任务中实现最先进精度并减少20%以上网络活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SNN中二进制脉冲特性导致的信息损失和精度下降问题，同时保持SNN的低功耗优势。

Method: 提出多级脉冲神经元模型减少量化误差，设计Sparse-ResNet架构解决脉冲雪崩效应，优化残差连接中的脉冲传播。

Result: 多级SNN在图像分类中比二进制SNN降低2-3倍能耗，在神经形态数据上将推理延迟压缩至1个时间步（10倍压缩），Sparse-ResNet实现最先进精度并减少20%以上网络活动。

Conclusion: 多级脉冲神经元模型和Sparse-ResNet架构有效解决了SNN的信息损失和脉冲传播问题，在保持低功耗优势的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are one of the most promising bio-inspired
neural networks models and have drawn increasing attention in recent years. The
event-driven communication mechanism of SNNs allows for sparse and
theoretically low-power operations on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. However,
the binary nature of instantaneous spikes also leads to considerable
information loss in SNNs, resulting in accuracy degradation. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-level spiking neuron model able to provide both
low-quantization error and minimal inference latency while approaching the
performance of full precision Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Experimental
results with popular network architectures and datasets, show that multi-level
spiking neurons provide better information compression, allowing therefore a
reduction in latency without performance loss. When compared to binary SNNs on
image classification scenarios, multi-level SNNs indeed allow reducing by 2 to
3 times the energy consumption depending on the number of quantization
intervals. On neuromorphic data, our approach allows us to drastically reduce
the inference latency to 1 timestep, which corresponds to a compression factor
of 10 compared to previously published results. At the architectural level, we
propose a new residual architecture that we call Sparse-ResNet. Through a
careful analysis of the spikes propagation in residual connections we highlight
a spike avalanche effect, that affects most spiking residual architectures.
Using our Sparse-ResNet architecture, we can provide state-of-the-art accuracy
results in image classification while reducing by more than 20% the network
activity compared to the previous spiking ResNets.

### [5] [Explainable Detection of AI-Generated Images with Artifact Localization Using Faster-Than-Lies and Vision-Language Models for Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23775)
*Aryan Mathur,Asaduddin Ahmed,Pushti Amit Vasoya,Simeon Kandan Sonar,Yasir Z,Madesh Kuppusamy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的图像真实性检测系统，结合轻量级卷积分类器和视觉语言模型，在32x32低分辨率图像上实现96.5%的准确率，并能定位和解释视觉伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成图像的真实感不断增强，验证视觉真实性面临挑战，需要开发能够解释检测结果的系统。

Method: 使用轻量级卷积分类器"Faster-Than-Lies"与视觉语言模型Qwen2-VL-7B结合，通过自编码器重建误差图生成伪影定位热图，并将70种视觉伪影分为8个语义组。

Result: 在扩展的CiFAKE数据集上达到96.5%的准确率，在8核CPU上推理时间为175ms，能够生成可解释的文本描述检测到的异常。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了结合视觉和语言推理在低分辨率图像中进行可解释真实性检测的可行性，并概述了在取证、工业检测和社交媒体审核等领域的跨域应用潜力。

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying
visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection
system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier
("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify,
localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5%
accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial
perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling
deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction
error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance
interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual
artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text
generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of
combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity
detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain
applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

### [6] [CountFormer: A Transformer Framework for Learning Visual Repetition and Structure in Class-Agnostic Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23785)
*Md Tanvir Hossain,Akif Islam,Mohd Ruhul Ameen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountFormer是一个基于transformer的框架，通过识别重复模式和结构一致性来实现类别无关的对象计数，在复杂形状和密集场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计数模型难以处理复杂形状、内部对称或重叠的对象，无法像人类那样通过视觉重复和结构关系来计数。

Method: 基于CounTR架构，用自监督基础模型DINOv2替换视觉编码器，加入位置嵌入融合来保持几何关系，通过轻量卷积解码器生成密度图。

Result: 在FSC-147数据集上达到当前最优方法相当的性能，在结构复杂或密集场景中表现出更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 集成DINOv2等基础模型使计数系统能够接近人类的结构感知能力，推进真正通用且无需示例的计数范式。

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition
and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However,
most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often
miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping
components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based
framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for
class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model
replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2,
which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We
further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric
relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a
lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model
achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while
demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed
scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2
enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception,
advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

### [7] [A geometric and deep learning reproducible pipeline for monitoring floating anthropogenic debris in urban rivers using in situ cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23798)
*Gauthier Grimmer,Romain Wenger,Clément Flint,Germain Forestier,Gilles Rixhon,Valentin Chardon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于固定摄像头的深度学习框架，用于河流漂浮垃圾的连续监测和量化，包括最佳模型选择和几何尺寸估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 河流中漂浮的人为垃圾对生物多样性、水质和人类活动产生负面影响，需要有效的监测方法。

Method: 使用固定原位摄像头，结合深度学习进行垃圾检测和量化，采用几何模型从2D图像估计物体实际尺寸，并测试数据泄漏偏差。

Result: 验证了在复杂环境条件下深度学习模型的准确性和推理速度，展示了基于投影几何和回归修正的度量物体估计可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发低成本、自动化的城市水环境监测系统提供了可行途径，数据集构建协议和时序泄漏考虑至关重要。

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a
pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on
biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and
recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the
monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This
study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and
monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification
of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference
speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a
range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including
experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model
is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.
This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of
the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the
dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of
negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the
feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with
regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the
development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic
environments.

*Forouzan Fallah,Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Hyunho Lee,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareFlow是一个物理感知的遥感图像超分辨率框架，通过双条件架构和不确定性量化来解决分布外条件下的鲁棒性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像超分辨率在分布外条件下（如罕见地貌特征、多传感器数据）往往会产生视觉合理但物理不准确的结果，需要提高鲁棒性

Method: 采用双条件架构：门控ControlNet保持几何保真度，文本提示提供语义指导；引入多面损失函数确保光谱和辐射一致性；使用随机前向传播量化预测不确定性

Result: 在盲评估中，地球物理专家认为模型输出接近真实图像质量，显著优于现有基线；感知指标定量提升，FID降低近40%

Conclusion: RareFlow为数据稀缺科学领域提供了高保真合成框架，并为严重域偏移下的可控生成提供了新范式

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing imagery often fails under
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, such as rare geomorphic features captured
by diverse sensors, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate
results. We present RareFlow, a physics-aware SR framework designed for OOD
robustness. RareFlow's core is a dual-conditioning architecture. A Gated
ControlNet preserves fine-grained geometric fidelity from the low-resolution
input, while textual prompts provide semantic guidance for synthesizing complex
features. To ensure physically sound outputs, we introduce a multifaceted loss
function that enforces both spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor
properties. Furthermore, the framework quantifies its own predictive
uncertainty by employing a stochastic forward pass approach; the resulting
output variance directly identifies unfamiliar inputs, mitigating feature
hallucination. We validate RareFlow on a new, curated benchmark of multi-sensor
satellite imagery. In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated our model's
outputs as approaching the fidelity of ground truth imagery, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. This qualitative superiority is
corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, including a nearly
40\% reduction in FID. RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity
synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for
controlled generation under severe domain shift.

### [9] [TRELLISWorld: Training-Free World Generation from Object Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23880)
*Hanke Chen,Yuan Liu,Minchen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的方法，通过将通用文本到3D对象扩散模型重新用作模块化瓦片生成器，实现3D场景合成。将场景生成重新表述为多瓦片去噪问题，通过加权平均无缝融合重叠区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常局限于单对象生成、需要领域特定训练或缺乏完整360度视图支持，需要一种更通用、无需训练的场景生成方法。

Method: 将场景生成重新表述为多瓦片去噪问题，独立生成重叠的3D区域，通过加权平均进行无缝融合，利用对象级先验的泛化能力。

Result: 支持多样化场景布局、高效生成和灵活编辑，为通用语言驱动的3D场景构建提供了简单而强大的基础。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了对场景级数据集或重新训练的需求，依赖最少启发式方法，继承了对象级先验的泛化能力，实现了可扩展的大型连贯场景合成。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of
applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However,
existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require
domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In
this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by
repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile
generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem,
where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended
via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent
scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need
for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and
inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate
that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and
flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for
general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

### [10] [Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894)
*Jinxin Zhou,Jiachen Jiang,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LHT-CLIP是一个无需训练的新框架，通过系统利用CLIP在层、头和token级别的视觉区分性来改进语义分割性能，无需额外训练或预训练网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CLIP模型的图像级预训练目标与密集预测所需的像素级视觉理解之间存在错位，现有方法继承了前层的全局对齐偏差，导致分割性能不理想。

Method: 提出三种互补技术：语义空间重加权、选择性头增强和异常token替换，基于对CLIP在层、头和token级别视觉区分性的分析。

Result: 在8个常见语义分割基准测试中，LHT-CLIP实现了最先进的性能，证明了其有效性和实际部署的实用性。

Conclusion: LHT-CLIP通过系统利用CLIP的多层次视觉区分性，无需额外训练即可显著提升语义分割性能，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the
misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the
pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior
efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and
features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers,
leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose
LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the
visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through
comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers
primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual
discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14),
partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention
heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual
discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and
consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these
findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial
reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to
effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation
performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or
extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and
practicality for real-world deployment.

### [11] [DynaStride: Dynamic Stride Windowing with MMCoT for Instructional Multi-Scene Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23907)
*Eddison Pham,Prisha Priyadarshini,Adrian Maliackel,Kanishk Bandi,Cristian Meo,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaStride是一个无需手动场景分割的管道，通过自适应帧采样和多模态窗口技术生成连贯的场景级视频字幕，在YouCookII数据集上优于VLLaMA3和GPT-4o等基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教学视频中的场景级字幕需要理解视觉线索和时间结构，但现有字幕缺乏连贯性和质量，可能造成混淆并削弱视频的教育意图。

Method: 使用自适应帧采样和多模态窗口捕捉场景内关键转换，采用多模态思维链生成多个动作-对象对，通过动态步长窗口选择算法平衡时间上下文和冗余，最终生成融合视觉语义和时间推理的教学字幕。

Result: 在N-gram指标（BLEU、METEOR）和语义相似度指标（BERTScore、CLIPScore）上均优于基线模型，定性分析显示生成的字幕具有更好的时间连贯性和信息量。

Conclusion: DynaStride为改进AI驱动的教学内容生成提供了一个有前景的方向，能够产生更连贯和信息丰富的教学视频字幕。

Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by
requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By
aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports
procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for
skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may
lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the
video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a
pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual
scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride
performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key
transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought
process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused
using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances
temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates
visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption.
Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o,
demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and
semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses
further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally
coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving
AI-powered instructional content generation.

*Emily Kim,Julieta Martinez,Timur Bagautdinov,Jessica Hodgins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboPortrait3D：一种低延迟的人像新视角合成方法，通过结合图像到3D模型和扩散模型，在保持3D感知的同时显著提升人像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人像图像到3D模型存在视觉伪影、细节缺失和身份保持不足的问题，而图像扩散模型虽然质量高但计算昂贵且缺乏3D一致性。

Method: 使用前馈图像到虚拟人生成管道获取初始3D表示和噪声渲染，然后通过单步扩散模型进行多视角一致的精炼，采用合成多视图数据预训练和高质量真实图像微调的策略。

Result: 在质量和数量上均优于当前最先进的人像新视角合成方法，同时保持时间效率。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将图像扩散模型用于增强图像到虚拟人生成，实现了高质量、低延迟且3D一致的人像新视角合成。

Abstract: We introduce TurboPortrait3D: a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis
of human portraits. Our approach builds on the observation that existing
image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing
renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of
detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On
the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images,
but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus
are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this
work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to
significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while
maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a
single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward
image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and
corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step
diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically
trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we
introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a
large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively
and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view
synthesis, while being efficient in time.

*Xirui Jin,Renbiao Jin,Boying Li,Danping Zou,Wenxian Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarGS是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的室内场景重建框架，通过引入语言提示平面先验和几何先验监督，解决了在低纹理区域中3DGS几何重建模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅在室内场景的大面积低纹理区域中，仅使用光度损失会导致几何重建模糊，无法恢复高保真3D表面。

Method: 设计了语言提示平面先验(LP3)管道，使用预训练视觉语言分割模型并通过跨视图融合和几何先验检查来优化区域建议。在3D高斯优化中加入平面先验监督和几何先验监督两个额外项。

Result: 在标准室内基准测试中，PlanarGS重建了准确详细的3D表面，大幅优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: PlanarGS通过结合平面和几何先验，有效提升了室内场景的3D重建质量，解决了3DGS在低纹理区域的局限性。

Abstract: Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an
efficient representation for novel-view synthesis, achieving impressive visual
quality. However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common
in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields
ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for
indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for
Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language
segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and
inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized
with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar
consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians
toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on
standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs
accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art

### [14] [Adaptive Training of INRs via Pruning and Densification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23943)
*Diana Aldana,João Paulo Lima,Daniel Csillag,Daniel Perazzo,Haoan Feng,Luiz Velho,Tiago Novello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIRe是一种自适应隐式神经表示训练方案，通过神经元剪枝和输入频率密集化来优化网络架构，在减小模型规模的同时保持甚至提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式神经表示方法在选择输入频率和架构时存在挑战，通常需要启发式方法和大量超参数优化，且参数冗余问题未得到有效解决。

Method: 采用神经元剪枝机制避免冗余，通过识别贡献较小的神经元并应用目标权重衰减来转移信息，然后进行结构化剪枝；同时通过输入频率密集化在信号欠拟合的频谱区域添加频率来扩展表示基础。

Result: 在图像和SDF上的实验表明，AIRe能够减小模型规模，同时保持甚至改善重建质量。

Conclusion: AIRe提供了一种改进的网络规模与重建质量之间的权衡方案，代码和预训练模型将公开发布。

Abstract: Encoding input coordinates with sinusoidal functions into multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) has proven effective for implicit neural representations
(INRs) of low-dimensional signals, enabling the modeling of high-frequency
details. However, selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures
while managing parameter redundancy remains an open challenge, often addressed
through heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization schemes. In this
paper, we introduce AIRe ($\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{I}$mplicit neural
$\textbf{Re}$presentation), an adaptive training scheme that refines the INR
architecture over the course of optimization. Our method uses a neuron pruning
mechanism to avoid redundancy and input frequency densification to improve
representation capacity, leading to an improved trade-off between network size
and reconstruction quality. For pruning, we first identify less-contributory
neurons and apply a targeted weight decay to transfer their information to the
remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning. Next, the densification
stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits,
expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and SDFs,
we show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving, or even improving,
reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be released for public
use.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Neural USD框架，通过结构化、分层的方式表示场景和对象，实现精确的迭代式对象编辑控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前可控生成模型中精确迭代对象编辑的挑战，避免修改条件信号时导致的意外全局变化。

Method: 借鉴计算机图形学中的USD标准，采用分层结构表示场景和对象，应用微调方法确保控制信号解耦。

Result: 评估了框架的设计考虑，展示了Neural USD如何支持迭代和增量工作流程。

Conclusion: Neural USD框架为精确的对象编辑提供了有效的解决方案，支持外观、几何和姿态的独立控制。

Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeVision是一个创新的图像护栏系统，通过集成类人推理来增强适应性和透明度，无需重新训练即可动态适应新兴威胁，在多个基准测试中表现优于GPT-4o且速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像护栏模型受限于预定义类别，缺乏语义推理能力，容易误分类内容，且难以适应新兴威胁，需要昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 提出包含有效数据收集与生成框架、策略遵循训练流程和定制损失函数的方法，采用多样化QA生成和训练策略提升学习效果。

Result: SafeVision在VisionHarm-T上比GPT-4o提升8.6%，在VisionHarm-C上提升15.5%，速度快16倍以上，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SafeVision建立了全面、策略遵循且可解释的图像护栏系统，具有动态适应新兴威胁的能力。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and
transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever.
Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often
misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic
reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats,
requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we
introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like
reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates
an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following
training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA
generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision
dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating
the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and
explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks,
which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm,
a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party
(VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse
harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision
achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision
outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while
being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and
explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

TL;DR: 提出了一个将链式思维推理引入胸部X光解读的框架，通过两阶段训练（监督微调和强化学习）生成可解释的推理过程，提高临床可审计性和人机协作安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在医学图像分析中缺乏透明性，无法提供临床医生依赖的逐步推理过程，需要开发能够展示专家推理路径的可解释AI系统。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方法：首先进行推理风格的监督微调，然后使用基于可验证奖励的强化学习，模型结合高保真视觉编码，输出包含不确定性和鉴别诊断的放射科医生式推理过程。

Result: 在分布外评估中实现了竞争性的多标签分类性能，同时提高了可解释性；在专家放射科医生的阅读研究中，完整推理轨迹增强了信心，支持错误审计，并减少了报告最终化时间。

Conclusion: 该框架为胸部放射学和其他医学成像任务提供了可信赖、可解释的AI解决方案，其中推理质量与预测质量同等重要，并发布了代码和模型以支持社区发展。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image
analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent,
stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by
reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how
experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps
with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the
explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a
conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where
uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer
human-AI collaboration.
  Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training
recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by
reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray
abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic
thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In
out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label
classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert
radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error
auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model
NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable
AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality
is as critical as prediction quality.

Abstract: Cost-and-Quality (CQ) controllability in arbitrary-scale super-resolution is
crucial. Existing methods predict Fourier components one by one using a

TL;DR: TeleEgo是一个长时、流式、全模态的基准测试，用于在真实日常场景中评估以自我为中心的AI助手，包含14小时以上的同步多模态数据和12个诊断子任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估AI助手的能力，缺乏真实的流式场景或仅支持短期任务，无法满足现实世界中对多模态输入、实时响应和长期记忆的需求。

Method: 构建包含工作学习、生活方式、社交活动和外出文化四个领域的同步自我中心视频、音频和文本数据集，所有数据在统一时间线上对齐，并通过人工精炼获得高质量视觉叙述和语音转录。

Result: 数据集包含3,291个人工验证的问答项，涵盖多种问题格式，并提出了实时准确率和记忆持久时间两个关键指标来联合评估正确性、时间响应性和长期记忆能力。

Conclusion: TeleEgo为实用AI助手的发展提供了现实且全面的评估框架，推动了在真实日常环境中AI助手能力的进步。

Abstract: Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal
inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving
long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these
abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only
short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming,
omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily
contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized
egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle
\& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on
a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and
speech transcripts, curated through human refinement.TeleEgo defines 12
diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past
events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory
Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items
spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and
open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key
metrics -- Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time -- to jointly assess
correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention. TeleEgo provides
a realistic and comprehensive evaluation to advance the development of
practical AI assistants.

Result: 在多个数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法能有效减轻未见分布变化的影响，在未见外部数据集上取得了与最先进领域泛化DR模型相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: AdvBlur方法通过对抗性模糊图像和双损失函数框架，成功提高了糖尿病视网膜病变分类模型在分布变化下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet
early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from
fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to
distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices,
demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this
critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method
called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the
dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain
generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen
distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across
multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore
the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset
size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss
function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on
unseen external datasets.

Abstract: The automated analysis of the aortic vessel tree (AVT) from computed
tomography angiography (CTA) holds immense clinical potential, but its
development has been impeded by a lack of shared, high-quality data. We
launched the SEG.A. challenge to catalyze progress in this field by introducing
a large, publicly available, multi-institutional dataset for AVT segmentation.
The challenge benchmarked automated algorithms on a hidden test set, with
subsequent optional tasks in surface meshing for computational simulations. Our
findings reveal a clear convergence on deep learning methodologies, with 3D
U-Net architectures dominating the top submissions. A key result was that an
ensemble of the highest-ranking algorithms significantly outperformed
individual models, highlighting the benefits of model fusion. Performance was
strongly linked to algorithmic design, particularly the use of customized
post-processing steps, and the characteristics of the training data. This
initiative not only establishes a new performance benchmark but also provides a
lasting resource to drive future innovation toward robust, clinically
translatable tools.

Motivation: 火星科学领域缺乏标准化的基准测试和评估框架，限制了火星基础模型的发展，而其他领域通过标准化基准取得了显著进展。

Method: 构建了包含20个数据集的Mars-Bench基准，涵盖轨道和表面图像，专注于关键地质特征如陨石坑、锥体、巨石和霜冻，并提供标准化数据集和基线评估。

Conclusion: Mars-Bench旨在为火星科学建立标准化的基础，促进机器学习模型的开发和比较，所有数据、模型和代码都已公开。

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains
by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong
generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained
significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to
Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has
been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic
evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized
evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation
models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range
of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench
comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object
detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders,
and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline
evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data,
and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest
that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain
counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.
Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and
comparing machine learning models for Mars science. Our data, models, and code

Conclusion: APT框架有效解决了现有红队测试方法的局限性，能够生成人类可读、抗过滤的对抗性提示，显著提升了文本到图像模型安全评估的效果。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, their safety
mechanisms are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which maliciously generate
unsafe images. Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such
vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on
inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate
semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we
propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for
benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning
pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM
utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion
strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based
filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating
human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which
starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce
banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in
blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming
performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as
well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to
unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs
(e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized computer vision, but
training very deep networks has been challenging due to the vanishing gradient
problem. This paper explores Residual Networks (ResNet), introduced by He et
al. (2015), which overcomes this limitation by using skip connections. ResNet
enables the training of networks with hundreds of layers by allowing gradients
to flow directly through shortcut connections that bypass intermediate layers.
In our implementation on the CIFAR-10 dataset, ResNet-18 achieves 89.9%
accuracy compared to 84.1% for a traditional deep CNN of similar depth, while
also converging faster and training more stably.

Conclusion: SNELLA通过单阶段设计和自适应稀疏分配，有效解决了现有稀疏调优方法在性能和内存效率方面的局限性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision
models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves
remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to
downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current
methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by
gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during
fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located
weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which
results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the
optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to
overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates
the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two
low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by
introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the
resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,
enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant
weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that
encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their
importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted
on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different
pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA
performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.
90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.
Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%
across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M. Our source codes are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COLA是一个基于最优传输的跨模态对齐框架，通过恢复特征空间的全局图像-文本对齐和局部结构一致性，有效解决CLIP模型在对抗攻击下的特征错位问题，无需训练即可显著提升零样本分类的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗防御方法主要关注对抗微调或提示优化，但忽视了CLIP编码特征中存在的文本和图像特征错位问题。这种错位在对抗扰动下会被显著放大，导致分类性能严重下降。

Method: COLA框架包含两个步骤：(1)将对抗图像嵌入投影到类文本特征张成的子空间，过滤非语义失真同时保留判别信息；(2)将图像和文本建模为多个增强视图上的离散分布，通过最优传输细化对齐，并将子空间投影无缝集成到成本计算中。

Result: 在14个零样本分类基准上的广泛评估表明，COLA在PGD对抗攻击下平均提升了ImageNet及其变体6.7%的准确率，同时在干净样本上保持高精度。

Conclusion: COLA是一种无需训练且兼容现有微调模型的对抗防御框架，通过跨模态对齐有效解决了CLIP模型在对抗攻击下的特征错位问题，显著提升了零样本分类的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization
in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or
prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features,
which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other.
This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations,
leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this
problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal
transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by
restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in
the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a
subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic
distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models
images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and
refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly
integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal
alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and
compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14
zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA,
especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants
under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean
samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用少量真实样本微调T2I模型生成合成训练数据时容易过拟合并降低多样性，特别是在细粒度分类任务中。

Method: 首先提取类无关属性（场景背景、物体姿态等），在微调T2I模型时显式条件化这些属性，生成时将其边缘化，以缓解过拟合并保持生成先验。

Result: 在多个T2I模型、骨干网络和数据集上的实验表明，BOB在低样本细粒度分类任务中达到最先进性能，在18/24个实验设置中优于现有方法，在Aircraft数据集上比DataDream提升7.4%。

Conclusion: BOB方法能有效缓解T2I模型微调时的过拟合问题，提高合成数据质量，在低样本细粒度分类任务中显著提升性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used for synthetic dataset
generation, but generating effective synthetic training data for classification
remains challenging. Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help
improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause
overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a
fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for
fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first
extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We
then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I
model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates
overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation
errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive
experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained
classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms
DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning
a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images).
In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real
images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10
real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental
settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.

Method: 研究交叉注意力和自注意力机制的两个关键特性：应用自注意力反转实现文本移除，重分布交叉注意力减少文本幻觉。引入潜在优化框架中的新型损失函数：交叉注意力内容损失提高文本渲染准确性，自注意力样式损失促进样式定制。

Result: OmniText是第一个能够执行多样化文本图像操作任务的通才方法。在多个任务和指标上相比其他文本修复方法达到最先进性能，与专业方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的OmniText框架通过注意力机制分析和潜在优化，成功解决了文本图像操作中的关键挑战，实现了无需训练的多功能文本操作能力，并创建了OmniText-Bench基准数据集用于评估。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text synthesis have demonstrated
significant performance in inserting and editing text within images via
inpainting. However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three
key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation
(TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over
the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated
letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free
generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we
investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to
enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content.
Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying
self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on
surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we
redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text
tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce
novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention
content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss
to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a
benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images,
target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications
such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with
various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable
of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and
is comparable with specialist methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文发现预训练视觉模型的表示可解释性和分类性能呈正相关，并提出了一种量化表示可解释性的方法IIS，通过最大化可解释性可以进一步提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉模型在广泛应用中需要同时具备高分类性能和可解释性，但目前不清楚这两者是否能同时实现。

Method: 提出固有可解释性评分(IIS)，通过评估解释过程中的信息损失来量化表示的可解释性，并基于可解释性最大化进行微调。

Result: 发现表示的可解释性和分类性能呈正相关，通过可解释性最大化微调可以进一步提升分类性能，基于解释的预测准确性下降更少。

Conclusion: 实践者可以在预训练视觉模型中统一提升可解释性和分类性能，两者可以协同优化。

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes
are available at https://github.com/ssfgunner/IIS.

TL;DR: 提出UHKD框架，在频域中利用中间特征进行跨架构知识蒸馏，解决异构模型间的语义差异问题，在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K上分别获得5.59%和0.83%的性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法主要针对同构模型设计，在异构场景下性能下降，特别是涉及中间特征时。现有研究主要关注logits空间，对中间层的语义信息利用有限

Method: 使用傅里叶变换捕捉全局特征信息，通过特征转换模块(FTM)生成紧凑的频域表示，特征对齐模块(FAM)投影学生特征并进行多级匹配，结合中间特征的均方误差和logits的KL散度作为联合训练目标

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K数据集上，相比最新方法分别提升了5.59%和0.83%的性能

Conclusion: UHKD是统一异构表示并有效利用视觉知识的有效方法，能够缓解异构师生对之间的表示差异

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique that
transfers knowledge from a high-performance teacher to a lightweight student,
reducing cost while maintaining accuracy. In visual applications, where
large-scale image models are widely used, KD enables efficient deployment.
However, architectural diversity introduces semantic discrepancies that hinder
the use of intermediate representations. Most existing KD methods are designed
for homogeneous models and degrade in heterogeneous scenarios, especially when
intermediate features are involved. Prior studies mainly focus on the logits
space, making limited use of the semantic information in intermediate layers.
To address this limitation, Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD)
is proposed as a framework that leverages intermediate features in the
frequency domain for cross-architecture transfer. Fourier transform is applied
to capture global feature information, alleviating representational
discrepancies between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. A Feature
Transformation Module (FTM) produces compact frequency-domain representations
of teacher features, while a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects
student features and aligns them via multi-level matching. Training is guided
by a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features with
Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate gains of 5.59% and 0.83% over the latest method, highlighting UHKD
as an effective approach for unifying heterogeneous representations and
enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge

Abstract: We present DogMo, a large-scale multi-view RGB-D video dataset capturing
diverse canine movements for the task of motion recovery from images. DogMo
comprises 1.2k motion sequences collected from 10 unique dogs, offering rich
variation in both motion and breed. It addresses key limitations of existing
dog motion datasets, including the lack of multi-view and real 3D data, as well
as limited scale and diversity. Leveraging DogMo, we establish four motion
recovery benchmark settings that support systematic evaluation across monocular
and multi-view, RGB and RGB-D inputs. To facilitate accurate motion recovery,
we further introduce a three-stage, instance-specific optimization pipeline
that fits the SMAL model to the motion sequences. Our method progressively
refines body shape and pose through coarse alignment, dense correspondence
supervision, and temporal regularization. Our dataset and method provide a
principled foundation for advancing research in dog motion recovery and open up
new directions at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and
animal behavior modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC)框架，通过趋势一致性预测和模型特定误差容限搜索，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速扩散模型采样过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成质量优秀，但受限于昂贵的迭代采样成本。现有训练免费加速方法忽略去噪趋势且缺乏误差控制，导致轨迹偏差和结果不一致

Method: 1) 引入一致性趋势预测器，利用扩散轨迹的平滑连续性，将历史去噪模式投影到稳定未来方向；2) 提出模型特定误差容限搜索机制，通过识别从语义规划到质量精炼的过渡点来推导修正阈值

Result: ETC在FLUX基础上实现了2.65倍加速，同时一致性退化极小（-0.074 SSIM分数）

Conclusion: ETC框架有效解决了扩散模型加速中的轨迹偏差问题，实现了高质量加速采样

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain
bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods
accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods
ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance,
leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating
inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce
Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a
consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion
trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future
directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation
steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific
error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by
identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality
refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX
with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.

Motivation: 尽管现代文本到图像模型具有令人印象深刻的真实感，但在组合性方面仍存在困难，经常无法准确渲染对象数量、属性和空间关系。

Method: 利用大型语言模型从输入提示中合成显式布局，并将这些布局注入图像生成过程，通过目标中心化的视觉语言模型对多个候选结果进行重排序，迭代选择最符合提示的结果。

Conclusion: 该训练免费框架成功提升了文本到图像生成的布局忠实度，在保持美学质量的同时实现了更好的提示对齐效果。

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle
with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts,
attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a
training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with
self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic
quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize
explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image
generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge
reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome
iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based
inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with
prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available at

decomposing the essential elements required for video reconstruction into
multiple dimensions, and proposing a principled caption design methodology. To
support evaluation, we construct VC4VG-Bench, a new benchmark featuring
fine-grained, multi-dimensional, and necessity-graded metrics aligned with
T2V-specific requirements.Extensive T2V fine-tuning experiments demonstrate a
strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation
performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. We release all

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at
IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving
scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption
detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core
components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and
dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference
across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit
coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing,
Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to
each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with
object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question
requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature,
top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean
data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured
prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on
safety-critical autonomous driving tasks. Code and prompt are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了UAP-SAM2，这是首个针对SAM2模型的跨提示通用对抗攻击方法，通过双语义偏差框架解决了SAM2在视频分割中的鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2作为SAM的继任者，在视频分割中表现出强大的泛化能力，但其对抗鲁棒性尚未被探索。现有针对SAM的攻击方法无法直接迁移到SAM2，主要面临两个挑战：提示的方向性引导和跨帧的语义纠缠。

Method: 提出UAP-SAM2方法：1）使用目标扫描策略将每帧划分为k个区域并随机分配提示，减少优化过程中的提示依赖性；2）设计双语义偏差框架，通过扭曲当前帧语义和破坏连续帧间语义一致性来优化通用对抗扰动。

Result: 在6个数据集上的两个分割任务实验表明，UAP-SAM2显著优于现有最先进的攻击方法，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: UAP-SAM2成功解决了针对SAM2的跨提示通用对抗攻击问题，揭示了SAM2在对抗攻击下的脆弱性，并为评估分割基础模型的鲁棒性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation
model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted
significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video
segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear
whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this
paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and
SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural
differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement
across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the
first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual
semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a
target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly
assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For
effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a
UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the
semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six
datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

Abstract: Accurate polyp and cardiac segmentation for early detection and treatment is
essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer-like diseases.
Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented
limited generalizability, robustness, and inability to handle uncertainty,
which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper
introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the
Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module leveraging convolutional layers and fuzzy
logic. This module enhances the segmentation performance by identifying local
and global features while minimizing the uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity in
boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class
imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and
boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated.
Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available
datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, and ACDC.
Extensive experiments and visual studies show CLFSeg surpasses the existing
SOTA performance and focuses on relevant regions of interest in anatomical
structures. The proposed CLFSeg improves performance while ensuring computing
efficiency, which makes it a potential solution for real-world medical
diagnostic scenarios. Project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视觉生成虽然表现优异，但推理速度慢，需要数千步才能生成单个样本，限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于信息论中的耦合方法，通过最大化连续迭代中采样相同草稿token的概率来改进SJD，仅需对现有算法进行单行修改。

Result: 在图像生成中实现约4.2倍加速，视频生成中实现约13.3倍加速，且输出质量无损失。

Conclusion: MC-SJD通过简单的修改显著提升了自回归视觉生成的推理速度，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in
visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow
inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of
steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD,
a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR
visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi
Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR
generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations
significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises
from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To
overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on
coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the
probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations,
all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires
only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves
substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image
generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR
decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

Motivation: 解决主流扩散模型依赖推理时干预（如负引导或基于能量的优化）导致分布偏移、身份与非身份属性纠缠、视觉保真度和数据效用下降的问题。

Method: 设计条件扩散模型，包含身份掩码学习方案：身份解耦潜在重组器使用身份变分自编码器建模身份特征，非身份属性从同身份对中提取并通过双向潜在对齐；身份引导潜在协调器通过软门控融合表示；使用基于重构的损失训练模型以强制解耦。推理时从学习到的身份空间采样随机身份向量实现匿名化。

Result: 实验表明ID²Face在视觉质量、身份抑制和效用保持方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ID²Face通过训练中心化方法有效解决了身份匿名化问题，实现了更好的身份抑制和视觉质量保持。

Abstract: Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving
non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time
interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are
applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often
introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity
attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we
propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization
framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale
of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and
non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and
controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional
diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled
Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity
features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs
and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent
Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on
noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based
reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is
achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.
To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity
Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source
identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face
outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and
utility preservation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many
of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily
focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting
in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we
propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called
\textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing
for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and
coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic
completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of
selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a
token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional
coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score
into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select
the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and
LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at

Abstract: Microsaccades are small, involuntary eye movements vital for visual
perception and neural processing. Traditional microsaccade studies typically
use eye trackers or frame-based analysis, which, while precise, are costly and
limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a
high-speed, low-latency alternative by capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal
changes efficiently. This work introduces a pioneering event-based microsaccade
dataset to support research on small eye movement dynamics in cognitive
computing. Using Blender, we render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and
simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees,
divided into seven distinct classes. These are converted to event streams using
v2e, preserving the natural temporal dynamics of microsaccades, with durations
ranging from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11,
Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an
optical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve
around 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by
angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results
demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion
recognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research. The
dataset, code, and trained models will be publicly available at

*Qing Zhao,Weijian Deng,Pengxu Wei,ZiYi Dong,Hannan Lu,Xiangyang Ji,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Lipschitz正则化目标检测(LROD)框架，通过将图像恢复直接集成到检测器的特征学习中，解决传统级联框架中恢复网络和检测网络之间的功能不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在恶劣条件下（如雾霾和低光照）提升检测鲁棒性时，图像恢复通常作为预处理步骤来增强图像质量。但恢复网络和检测网络之间的功能不匹配会引入不稳定性并阻碍有效集成，这一问题尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过Lipschitz连续性的视角分析恢复和检测网络在输入空间和参数空间中的功能差异，提出Lipschitz正则化目标检测(LROD)框架，将图像恢复直接集成到检测器特征学习中，在训练期间协调两个任务的Lipschitz连续性。

Result: 在雾霾和低光照基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LR-YOLO持续提高了检测稳定性、优化平滑度和整体准确性。

Conclusion: LROD框架有效解决了恢复和检测网络之间的功能不匹配问题，通过Lipschitz正则化实现了更稳定和准确的目标检测。

Abstract: To improve detection robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., haze and low
light), image restoration is commonly applied as a pre-processing step to
enhance image quality for the detector. However, the functional mismatch
between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder
effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this
limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional
differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space
and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform
smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with
discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor
perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade
frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during
detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address
this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet
effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the
detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks
during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO
(LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive
experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO
consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall
accuracy.

Motivation: 现有基于注意力的阴影去除方法存在固定注意力模式问题，容易混合不相关区域的照明线索，导致结构扭曲和颜色不一致。

Method: 1. 使用Mamba选择性状态空间模型进行序列建模；2. 提出CrossGate方向调制机制，在输入门注入阴影感知相似性；3. 引入ColorShift正则化，通过对比学习抑制颜色污染。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，DeshadowMamba实现了最先进的视觉质量和强大的定量性能。

Conclusion: 通过将序列建模与阴影去除的结构完整性和色彩一致性要求相结合，提出的方法在阴影去除任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based
architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed
attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions,
leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we
revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use
of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through
directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global
receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential,
directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness
of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference
from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a
directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into
Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along
transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift
regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color
statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the
model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration.
Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity
and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art
visual quality and strong quantitative performance.

TL;DR: 提出UtilGen框架，通过下游任务反馈优化数据生成过程，生成任务特定、高实用性的训练数据，相比现有方法平均准确率提升3.87%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据增强方法主要关注数据的内在属性（如保真度和多样性），而忽略了任务特定需求。不同任务和网络架构对训练数据的要求差异很大，需要数据生成器考虑下游任务需求。

Method: 引入权重分配网络评估合成样本的任务特定效用，采用双级优化策略：模型级优化调整生成模型以适应下游任务，实例级优化在每轮生成中调整生成策略（如提示嵌入和初始噪声）。

Result: 在8个不同复杂度和粒度的基准数据集上的实验表明，UtilGen始终优于现有方法，平均准确率提升3.87%。数据影响和分布分析显示UtilGen生成更具影响力和任务相关性的合成数据。

Conclusion: UtilGen验证了从视觉特征中心到任务效用中心的数据增强范式转变的有效性，能够生成更高质量的任务特定训练数据。

Abstract: Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing
augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes
-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality
synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is
essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as
training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and
network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a
novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the
data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data
via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight
allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic
sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data
generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the
synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative
model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts
generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each
generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying
complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves
superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over
previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that
UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating
the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to
task utility-centric data augmentation.

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data
scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification
capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based
on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is
generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate
sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis
closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a
new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from
commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a
challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models
and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The
dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare
them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and
other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing
techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.
The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and
represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot
and zero-shot methods.

TL;DR: ViPER是一个自引导框架，通过两阶段强化学习策略将视觉感知学习构建为从粗到细的渐进过程，解决了视觉语言模型在细粒度视觉感知方面的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在细粒度视觉感知方面的有限能力成为实际应用中的关键瓶颈，现有方法如监督微调会损害通用能力，而强化微调则优先考虑文本推理而非视觉感知。

Method: 提出两阶段任务，将视觉感知学习构建为从粗到细的渐进过程；开发ViPER自引导框架，通过自我批判和自我预测实现迭代进化；协同整合图像级和实例级重建与两阶段强化学习策略，建立闭环训练范式。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL系列上应用ViPER产生Qwen-Viper系列，在七个综合基准测试中平均提升1.7%，在细粒度感知上提升高达6.0%，在不同视觉语言场景中持续展现优越性能并保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: ViPER不仅实现了感知能力的自我提升，还为生成与理解之间的互惠关系提供了具体证据，这是开发更自主、更强大的视觉语言模型的重要突破。

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Result: 提示学习方法在少样本场景下持续优于两个基准方法，其中自约束提示学习在跨域性能方面表现最为鲁棒。

Conclusion: 提示学习是连接卫星和航空影像领域差距的可扩展高效解决方案，为未来研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene
classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity
of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and
sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown
promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual
and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains
suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific
semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically
explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for
few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several
representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context
Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating
Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from
static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,
multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically
regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these
prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with
hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.
Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,
including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt
learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.
Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust
cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable
and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial
imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

Abstract: Teacher-student frameworks have emerged as a leading approach in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating strong performance
across various tasks. However, the learning effects are still limited by the
strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer process between teacher

switching Dual-Student architecture that strategically selects the most
reliable student at each iteration to enhance dual-student collaboration and
prevent error reinforcement. We also introduce a strategy of Loss-Aware
Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure that the teacher absorbs
meaningful information from students, improving the quality of pseudo-labels.
Our plug-and-play framework is extensively evaluated on 3D medical image
segmentation datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy

TL;DR: W2-Net通过双查询机制解决指代表达式计数问题，将问题解耦为"计数什么"和"在哪里看"，显著提升了子类级别的计数精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指代表达式计数方法存在根本性挑战：标注点通常放置在类别代表性位置（如头部），迫使模型关注类别级特征而忽略其他视觉区域（如腿部）的属性信息。

Method: 提出W2-Net框架，采用双查询机制：标准w2c查询定位对象，专用w2s查询从属性特定视觉区域提取特征。同时引入子类可分离匹配策略，通过排斥力增强子类间可分性。

Result: 在REC-8K数据集上显著优于最先进方法，计数误差降低22.5%（验证集）和18.0%（测试集），定位F1分别提高7%和8%。

Conclusion: W2-Net通过解耦"计数什么"和"在哪里看"，有效解决了指代表达式计数中的属性信息忽略问题，为细粒度子类计数提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring Expression Counting (REC) extends class-level object counting to
the fine-grained subclass-level, aiming to enumerate objects matching a textual
expression that specifies both the class and distinguishing attribute. A
fundamental challenge, however, has been overlooked: annotation points are
typically placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), forcing
models to focus on class-level features while neglecting attribute information
from other visual regions (e.g., legs for "walking"). To address this, we
propose W2-Net, a novel framework that explicitly decouples the problem into
"what to count" and "where to see" via a dual-query mechanism. Specifically,
alongside the standard what-to-count (w2c) queries that localize the object, we
introduce dedicated where-to-see (w2s) queries. The w2s queries are guided to
seek and extract features from attribute-specific visual regions, enabling
precise subclass discrimination. Furthermore, we introduce Subclass Separable
Matching (SSM), a novel matching strategy that incorporates a repulsive force
to enhance inter-subclass separability during label assignment. W2-Net
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the REC-8K dataset, reducing
counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), and improving
localization F1 by 7% and 8%, respectively. Code will be available.

Abstract: Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance
in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to
heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion
segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and
postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with
BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16}
quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts
and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and
chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the
original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that
high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically
usable tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏振图像融合结合S0和DOLP图像，通过互补的纹理特征揭示表面粗糙度和材料特性，在伪装识别、组织病理分析、表面缺陷检测等领域有重要应用。但在复杂光照环境下，不同偏振图像间的固有对比度差异给融合带来挑战。

Conclusion: MLSN网络有效解决了复杂光照环境下偏振图像融合的对比度差异问题，提出的亮度感知机制和特征融合策略显著提升了融合质量，同时发布的MSP数据集解决了偏振图像融合领域高质量数据集稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface
roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, which
has important applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology
analysis, surface defect detection and other fields. To intergrate
coL-Splementary information from different polarized images in complex
luminance environment, we propose a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN).
In the encoder stage, we propose a multi-scale spatial weight matrix through a
brightness-branch , which dynamically weighted inject the luminance into the
feature maps, solving the problem of inherent contrast difference in polarized
images. The global-local feature fusion mechanism is designed at the bottleneck
layer to perform windowed self-attention computation, to balance the global
context and local details through residual linking in the feature dimension
restructuring stage. In the decoder stage, to further improve the adaptability
to complex lighting, we propose a Brightness-Enhancement module, establishing
the mapping relationship between luminance distribution and texture features,
realizing the nonlinear luminance correction of the fusion result. We also
present MSP, an 1000 pairs of polarized images that covers 17 types of indoor
and outdoor complex lighting scenes. MSP provides four-direction polarization
raw maps, solving the scarcity of high-quality datasets in polarization image
fusion. Extensive experiment on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets verify that the
proposed MLSN outperms the state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective
evaluations, and the MS-SSIM and SD metircs are higher than the average values
of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31%,
respectively. The source code and dataset is avalable at

Abstract: Medical images used to train machine learning models are often accompanied by
radiology reports containing rich expert annotations. However, relying on these
reports as inputs for clinical prediction requires the timely manual work of a
trained radiologist. This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports
be leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works
are limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them
to predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with
labels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we
conduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both
pre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g.,
12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings
reveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for
downstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the
text; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be
detrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead
to significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training
method in certain settings. These results provide actionable insights into when
and how to leverage privileged text data to train medical image classifiers
while highlighting gaps in current research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REFLECT模型在无监督检测中风后结构异常方面表现优异，使用健康对照数据训练能更好建模正常变异，提高对病灶和非病灶异常的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中风后MRI显示的结构变化（如萎缩和脑室扩大）是恢复和预后的重要影像生物标志物，但传统监督分割方法难以有效捕捉这些异常。

Method: 使用基于流的生成模型REFLECT进行无监督异常检测，在ATLAS数据集上评估，比较使用中风患者无病灶切片和健康对照数据训练的效果。

Result: 使用健康对照数据训练的模型在病灶分割（Dice=0.37 vs 0.27）和非病灶异常检测敏感性（FROC=0.62 vs 0.43）方面均优于使用中风患者数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 在完全健康解剖结构上训练能更好地建模正常变异，从而实现更广泛和可靠的结构异常检测。

Abstract: Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).
Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability,
enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-object tracking (MOT) method, dubbed
GenTrack, whose main contributions include: a hybrid tracking approach
employing both stochastic and deterministic manners to robustly handle unknown
and time-varying numbers of targets, particularly in maintaining target
identity (ID) consistency and managing nonlinear dynamics, leveraging particle
swarm optimization (PSO) with some proposed fitness measures to guide
stochastic particles toward their target distribution modes, enabling effective
tracking even with weak and noisy object detectors, integration of social
interactions among targets to enhance PSO-guided particles as well as improve
continuous updates of both strong (matched) and weak (unmatched) tracks,
thereby reducing ID switches and track loss, especially during occlusions, a
GenTrack-based redefined visual MOT baseline incorporating a comprehensive
state and observation model based on space consistency, appearance, detection
confidence, track penalties, and social scores for systematic and efficient
target updates, and the first-ever publicly available source-code reference
implementation with minimal dependencies, featuring three variants, including
GenTrack Basic, PSO, and PSO-Social, facilitating flexible reimplementation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly
employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier
consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear
dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and
non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through
proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance
similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic
association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix
incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections,
detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is
proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their
identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets
and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states
provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates.
The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded
videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable.
Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method
and compared-trackers are provided on GitHub:

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于卫星影像和机器学习的无传感器方法，用于实时监测黎巴嫩Qaraaoun水库的蓄水量，无需地面测量设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Qaraaoun水库作为黎巴嫩最大的地表水体，其可持续管理依赖于可靠的蓄水量监测，但传感器频繁故障和维护能力有限影响了传统监测方法。

Method: 整合开源卫星影像（Sentinel-2和Landsat）、新型水体分割指数和基于支持向量回归的机器学习模型，仅通过卫星影像提取的水面面积来估算水库容积。

Result: 水体分割精度超过95%，优化后的SVR模型误差低于水库总容量的1.5%，决定系数超过0.98，实现了高精度的容积估算。

Conclusion: 该方法具有鲁棒性和成本效益，为水库蓄水量监测提供了实用的无传感器解决方案，可推广到其他水体，并为气候变化研究提供了50年的时间序列数据。

Abstract: The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface
water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable
monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and
limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that
integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation,
and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near
real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is
delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning
model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset
that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations
using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate
reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite
imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the
proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the
shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR
performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and
coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the
robustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution
for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The
proposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the
resulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate
change and environmental patterns.

Motivation: 随着AI在安全关键领域的应用增加，确保模型透明度和可信度至关重要。虽然分类任务的可解释AI评估已有进展，但语义分割的评估策略相对不足。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于推进透明、可信和可问责的语义分割模型发展。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is
essential, particularly as they are increasingly applied in safety-critical and
high-stakes domains. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising approach
to address this challenge, yet the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains
crucial for optimizing the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive
performance, and interpretability. While extensive progress has been achieved
in evaluating XAI techniques for classification tasks, evaluation strategies
tailored to semantic segmentation remain relatively underexplored. This work
introduces a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, explicitly accounting for
both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework employs
pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide
fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently
adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the
efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These
findings contribute to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable
semantic segmentation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于功能分解的深度条件图像压缩框架DCIC-sgp，通过自生成先验来分离图像的结构和纹理信息，有效解决了低码率下的几何变形问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学习型图像压缩方法难以建模自然图像中复杂的相关性结构，特别是全局结构与局部纹理的纠缠问题，导致低码率时出现严重几何变形。

Method: 采用功能分解框架，首先编码自生成的先验来捕捉图像结构主干，然后用这个先验全面调制整个压缩流程，特别是分析变换，使其专注于残差的高熵细节。

Result: 视觉分析显示大幅减轻了传统编解码器在低码率时的几何变形伪影；在Kodak、CLIC和Tecnick数据集上分别实现了14.4%、15.7%和15.1%的BD-rate降低。

Conclusion: 提出的分层依赖驱动方法实现了信息流的有效分离，在保持竞争力的性能同时，显著改善了低码率下的视觉质量。

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has shown great promise for achieving high
rate-distortion performance. However, current LIC methods are often limited in
their capability to model the complex correlation structures inherent in
natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures
with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation. This
limitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To
address this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,
which we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors
(DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior
to encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently
utilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire
compression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis
transform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the
residual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach
achieves an effective disentanglement of information streams. Our extensive
experiments validate this assertion; visual analysis demonstrates that our
method substantially mitigates the geometric deformation artifacts that plague
conventional codecs at low bitrates. Quantitatively, our framework establishes
highly competitive performance, achieving significant BD-rate reductions of
14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against the VVC test model VTM-12.1 on the Kodak, CLIC,
and Tecnick datasets.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言领域表现出色，但在视觉领域仍面临组合理解、样本效率和通用问题解决能力的挑战。研究者希望探索视频扩散模型是否能弥补这一差距。

Method: 设计对照实验，让预训练的语言模型和视频扩散模型都配备轻量级适配器，在各自自然模态中执行任务，包括ARC-AGI、ConceptARC、视觉游戏、路径规划和元胞自动机等基准测试。

Result: 在所有基准测试中，视频扩散模型比语言模型表现出更高的数据效率，证明了视频预训练提供的归纳偏置优势。

Conclusion: 视频预训练为视觉基础模型的发展提供了有益的归纳偏置，支持在视觉领域取得进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视角运动捕捉需要精确的相机标定，限制了非专业用户和野外采集的可访问性。现有的无标定方法虽然缓解了这一需求，但存在计算成本高和重建精度低的问题。

Method: 利用现成的2D关键点检测器，结合置信度驱动的时空关键点采样策略和图优化全局优化，同时标定相机（包括畸变系数）并重建3D关键点和密集场景点云。

Result: 在EgoHumans和Human3.6M数据集上，相比现有方法，相机平移误差减少83-85%，相机角度误差减少86-92%，世界平均关节误差减少83-91%。处理效率高，特定配置下36分钟可处理1小时20分钟的视频。

Conclusion: Kineo提供了一个高效、精确的无标定运动捕捉解决方案，显著提升了多视角运动捕捉的可访问性和实用性。

Abstract: Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for
precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and
in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this
requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction
accuracy.
  We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless
motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated,
consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf
detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady
distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point
maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling
strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust
calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We
further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D
reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
  Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements
over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%,
camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by
83-91%.
  Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view
sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to
process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly
released to promote reproducibility and practical adoption at

TL;DR: Decoupled MeanFlow是一种简单解码策略，可将流模型转换为流映射模型而无需架构修改，实现1-4步高质量生成，在ImageNet上获得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去噪生成模型需要大量去噪步骤，流映射可减少离散化误差并加速采样，但传统训练方法需要架构修改，限制了与预训练流模型的兼容性。

Method: 提出解耦均值流方法，通过条件化扩散变换器的最终块到后续时间步，将预训练流模型直接重新用作流映射，结合增强训练技术实现高效采样。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256和512x512上，1步FID分别达到2.16和2.12，4步时达到1.51和1.68，性能接近流模型但推理速度快100倍以上。

Conclusion: 训练流模型后转换比从头训练流映射更高效有效，该方法在保持高质量生成的同时显著加速推理过程。

Abstract: Denoising generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based models, produce
high-quality samples but require many denoising steps due to discretization
error. Flow maps, which estimate the average velocity between timesteps,
mitigate this error and enable faster sampling. However, their training
typically demands architectural changes that limit compatibility with
pretrained flow models. We introduce Decoupled MeanFlow, a simple decoding
strategy that converts flow models into flow map models without architectural
modifications. Our method conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers
on the subsequent timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be directly
repurposed as flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques, this
design enables high-quality generation in as few as 1 to 4 steps. Notably, we
find that training flow models and subsequently converting them is more
efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch. On ImageNet
256x256 and 512x512, our models attain 1-step FID of 2.16 and 2.12,
respectively, surpassing prior art by a large margin. Furthermore, we achieve
FID of 1.51 and 1.68 when increasing the steps to 4, which nearly matches the
performance of flow models while delivering over 100x faster inference.

TL;DR: 提出DisK-NeuralRTI方法，通过知识蒸馏降低NeuralRTI的计算成本，解决传统RTI方法在复杂反射场建模中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RTI方法（如PTM和HSH）使用固定基函数和少量像素系数，难以准确捕捉复杂反射场，在强反射和阴影区域产生伪影。NeuralRTI虽然质量更好，但解码器网络参数多，渲染计算成本高，在有限硬件上无法处理大图像。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是有效降低NeuralRTI计算成本的方法，能够在保持高质量的同时实现高效的交互式重照明。

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad
delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.
It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and
Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our
framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and
broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project

Result: 在OSWorld-MCP上对最先进的多模态代理进行广泛评估显示，MCP工具通常提高了任务成功率（例如，OpenAI o3在15步时从8.3%提高到20.4%，Claude 4 Sonnet在50步时从40.1%提高到43.3%）。然而，即使是最强的模型工具调用率也相对较低，仅为36.3%。

Conclusion: 通过明确测量MCP工具使用技能，OSWorld-MCP加深了对多模态代理的理解，并为在复杂、工具辅助环境中评估性能设定了新标准。

Abstract: With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal
agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past
evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation
abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been
largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those
evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP,
the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents'
tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world
environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create
tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous
manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common
applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical
applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art
multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task
success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1%
to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of
assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have
relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for
improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge. By explicitly measuring
MCP tool usage skills, OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents
and sets a new standard for evaluating performance in complex, tool-assisted
environments. Our code, environment, and data are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于深度学习的散射伪影校正方法，利用高斯径向基函数建模点散射函数，并将其嵌入Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks层，有效校正锥束CT中的散射伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锥束CT在数据采集过程中易受散射影响，导致重建图像出现CT值偏差和组织对比度降低，从而影响诊断准确性。

Method: 利用投影域中观测点散射概率密度分布具有旋转对称性的物理先验知识，使用高斯径向基函数建模点散射函数，并将其嵌入KAN网络层，学习高维散射特征的非线性映射。

Result: 通过合成和真实扫描实验验证，该方法能有效校正重建图像中的散射伪影，在定量指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合散射光子分布的物理特性和KAN网络的复杂函数映射能力，该方法提高了散射建模的准确性，为锥束CT图像质量提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve
three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is
susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias
and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading
diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based
scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge.
Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density
distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method
uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function
and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides
efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter
features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon
distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the
model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness
of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments.
Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter
artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in
terms of quantitative metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于人脸伪造检测的双分支卷积神经网络，结合空间域和频域特征，通过注意力机制融合，使用统一的FSC损失函数提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的快速发展使得伪造人脸图像更加逼真，对AI安全、数字媒体完整性和公众信任构成严重威胁，迫切需要鲁棒且泛化性强的人脸伪造检测方法。

Method: 双分支CNN架构：RGB分支捕获语义信息，频率分支关注高频伪影；引入通道注意力模块自适应融合特征；设计FSC损失函数结合焦点损失、监督对比损失和频率中心边界损失。

Result: 在DiFF基准测试中表现优异，涵盖文本到图像、图像到图像、人脸交换和人脸编辑四种伪造方法，性能超过人类平均准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测多种人脸伪造技术，对保护AI生态系统免受视觉伪造攻击具有重要贡献。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
realistic forged facial images, posing significant threats to AI security,
digital media integrity, and public trust. Face forgery techniques, ranging
from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image
synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as
misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge
underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection
methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we
propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery
detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency
domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency
branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative
models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse
these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for
forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a
unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised
contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class
separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which
includes forged images generated from four representative methods:
text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves
strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human
accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential
contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.

Motivation: 病理学家对千兆像素全切片图像（WSIs）的诊断准确率约为70%，增加第二位病理学家并不能显著提高决策一致性，该领域缺乏足够的行为数据来解释诊断错误和不一致性。

Method: 通过名为PTAH的应用基础测试平台收集数据，强调生态有效性，记录了19位病理学家解读397张WSIs的18.69小时数据，包括171,909次注视、263,320次扫视和1,867,362次鼠标交互事件。

Abstract: Interpretation of giga-pixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is an important but
difficult task for pathologists. Their diagnostic accuracy is estimated to
average around 70%. Adding a second pathologist does not substantially improve
decision consistency. The field lacks adequate behavioral data to explain
diagnostic errors and inconsistencies. To fill in this gap, we present
PathoGaze1.0, a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing the dynamic visual
search and decision-making processes of the full diagnostic workflow during
cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse
interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision
data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs. The data
collection process emphasizes ecological validity through an
application-grounded testbed, called PTAH. In total, we recorded 171,909
fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events. In

TL;DR: 提出Group Relative Attention Guidance方法，通过重新加权DiT模型中不同token的delta值来调节编辑强度，实现无需调参的连续细粒度图像编辑控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Diffusion-in-Transformer的图像编辑方法缺乏对编辑程度的有效控制，限制了定制化结果的实现

Method: 分析DiT模型中的MM-Attention机制，发现Query和Key token共享仅与层相关的偏置向量。将该偏置解释为模型固有编辑行为，token与其对应偏置的delta编码内容特定编辑信号。提出GRAG方法重新加权不同token的delta值来调节模型对输入图像相对于编辑指令的关注度

Result: 实验表明GRAG只需4行代码即可集成到现有编辑框架中，持续提升编辑质量。相比常用的Classifier-Free Guidance，GRAG能实现更平滑、更精确的编辑程度控制

Conclusion: GRAG是一种简单有效的图像编辑控制方法，通过注意力机制重新加权实现连续细粒度的编辑强度调节

Abstract: Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has
undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack
effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve
more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the
MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key
tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias
as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between
each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing
signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a
simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens
to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing
instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing
intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image
editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four
lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to
the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more
precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at

### [70] [Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709)
*Yihao Li,Saeed Salehi,Lyle Ungar,Konrad P. Kording*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现预训练的视觉变换器（ViTs）能够自然涌现出物体绑定能力，即识别哪些图像块属于同一物体的能力。这种能力在自监督模型（DINO、MAE、CLIP）中表现突出，但在ImageNet监督模型中较弱，表明这是通过特定预训练目标获得的而非架构特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉变换器是否自然具备物体绑定能力——将多个特征组合成统一物体表征的能力，这对于人类认知至关重要。研究假设ViTs能够表示两个图像块是否属于同一物体（IsSameObject属性）。

Method: 使用相似性探针从ViT各层的图像块嵌入中解码IsSameObject属性，比较不同预训练模型（自监督vs监督）的表现，并通过消融实验验证该信号的功能重要性。

Result: 相似性探针准确率超过90%，证明ViTs确实编码了物体绑定信息。自监督模型比监督模型表现出更强的绑定能力，且IsSameObject信号存在于低维子空间中并主动引导注意力。

Conclusion: ViTs自然涌现出物体绑定能力，这种能力服务于预训练目标，挑战了ViTs缺乏物体绑定的观点，展示了连接主义系统中符号知识的自然涌现。

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While
prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)
explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability
naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they
could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for
downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic
nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two
patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode
IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,
which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability
emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker
in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial
architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining
objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a
low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal
actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations
degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,
implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining
objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and
highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges
naturally in a connectionist system.

TL;DR: 提出SAGE方法，通过结构引导和生成合成实现零样本视频过渡，在多样剪辑间产生平滑、语义一致的过渡效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频过渡方法在处理大时间间隔或显著语义差异的剪辑时，难以保持内容感知和视觉连贯性，需要更先进的过渡技术

Method: 结合结构引导（线图和运动流）与生成合成，无需微调即可实现零样本视频过渡，借鉴艺术工作流程中的轮廓对齐和特征插值策略

Result: 在定量指标和用户研究中，SAGE优于传统方法和生成基线，能够处理多样剪辑间的过渡

Conclusion: SAGE方法通过结构感知的生成合成，有效解决了视频过渡中的语义一致性和视觉连贯性问题

Abstract: Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips,
but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit
professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques
(cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening
methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle
with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant
semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent
transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows,
distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient
features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we
propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot
approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion
flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent
transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with
current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate
that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative
metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code

Abstract: Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling
cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often
underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view
infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs,
and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based
bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based
multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number
of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed
graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features
into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and
BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection,
featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental
conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset
RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions,
including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the
potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE方法在语言模型中表现良好，但在扩散变换器中效果有限，主要原因是视觉token存在空间冗余和功能异质性，阻碍了专家的专业化。

Method: 提出两阶段路由器：条件路由根据功能角色将图像token划分为条件集和无条件集；原型路由通过可学习原型基于语义内容细化条件token的分配。还提出路由对比损失来增强原型路由过程。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，ProMoE在Rectified Flow和DDPM训练目标下均超越了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ProMoE通过明确的路由指导和语义引导机制，有效解决了视觉MoE中的专家专业化问题，为扩散变换器的MoE应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model
capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success
in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to
fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are
semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens
exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert
specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework
featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert
specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition
image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing
according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional
image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on
semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent
space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for
incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is
crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss
that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting
intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods
under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be
made publicly available.

Motivation: 连续空间视频生成发展迅速，但离散方法因误差累积和长上下文不一致而落后，需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 将视频生成任务制定为离散时空标记的迭代全局优化，采用线性化度量路径和分辨率相关时间步长偏移机制，以及异步时间微调策略。

Conclusion: URSA证明了离散生成建模在视频生成中的有效性，为可扩展视频生成提供了强大框架。

Abstract: Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete
approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency.
In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform
discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework
that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video
generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an
iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates
two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep
Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to
high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while
requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an
asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within
a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.
Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks
demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
methods. Code and models are available at https://github.com/baaivision/URSA

TL;DR: 提出Generative View Stitching (GVS)方法，通过并行采样整个序列来解决自回归视频扩散模型在相机引导视频生成中的碰撞问题，实现稳定、无碰撞且帧间一致的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型虽然能进行长序列稳定生成，但无法利用未来信息来指导当前生成，在预定义相机轨迹的引导下容易发生场景碰撞，导致生成崩溃。

Method: 提出GVS采样算法，基于Diffusion Forcing框架，引入Omni Guidance技术同时考虑过去和未来信息，并提出了闭环机制来确保长距离一致性。

Result: GVS实现了稳定、无碰撞、帧间一致的相机引导视频生成，能够处理包括不可能楼梯在内的各种预定义相机路径，并成功闭合循环。

Conclusion: GVS方法有效解决了自回归模型在相机引导视频生成中的限制，为复杂相机轨迹下的稳定视频生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best

Motivation: 传统启发式算法在解决NP难组合优化问题时性能有限，而精确方法在大规模实例中计算不可行，需要开发更有效的启发式算法。

Method: 通过人类与LLM协作发现新的启发式算法EDDC和MDDC，基于经典的EDD和MDD规则，并与混合整数规划和动态规划等精确方法进行严格对比。

Result: 对于超过100个作业的实例，EDDC改进了经典EDD规则，MDDC始终优于传统启发式算法，在大型复杂实例中与精确方法竞争。

Conclusion: 人类与LLM协作可以有效产生可扩展的高性能启发式算法，即使在资源有限的情况下也能有效解决NP难组合优化问题。

Abstract: Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization
literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large
Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT)
problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a
single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We
develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger
(EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date
(EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that
employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered
algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time
derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare
their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across
various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than
100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become
computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD
rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently
outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact
approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows
that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics
for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited
resources when effectively configured.

Abstract: We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified,
scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs.
Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale
continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and
simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse
trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual
loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that
balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS
achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on
open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in
unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet
in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that
the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and
multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action
representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path
toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

Motivation: 研究AI在科学问题解决中的角色，特别关注其对学科创造力的潜在影响，旨在理解AI如何改变科学实践的价值和性质。

Method: 基于创造力哲学的理论框架，区分创造性方法与创造性成果，引入学科创造力概念，并通过两个数学案例进行实证分析。

Result: 计算可以扩展学科创造力，但某些AI方法可能取代学科创造力，这种取代有潜力改变科学追求的价值。

Conclusion: AI在科学中的应用需要谨慎考虑其对学科创造力的影响，避免可能削弱科学追求价值的创造力取代现象。

Abstract: This paper examines the role of artificial intelligence in scientific
problem-solving, with a focus on its implications for disciplinary creativity.
Drawing on recent work in the philosophy of creativity, I distinguish between
creative approaches and creative products, and introduce the concept of
disciplinary creativity -the creative application of discipline-specific
expertise to a valued problem within that field. Through two cases in
mathematics, I show that while computation can extend disciplinary creativity,
certain approaches involving AI can serve to displace it. This displacement has
the potential to alter (and, perhaps, diminish) the value of scientific
pursuit.

### [79] [Multi-Environment POMDPs: Discrete Model Uncertainty Under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23744)
*Eline M. Bovy,Caleb Probine,Marnix Suilen,Ufuk Topcu,Nils Jansen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了多环境POMDP（ME-POMDP）和对抗信念POMDP（AB-POMDP）的概念，用于处理具有离散模型不确定性的POMDP问题，并开发了精确和近似的算法来计算鲁棒策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当多个领域专家对问题建模存在分歧时，需要找到一种能够应对所有可能POMDP模型的单一鲁棒策略，以最大化最坏情况下的奖励。

Method: 将ME-POMDP推广到具有初始信念集合的AB-POMDP，证明任意ME-POMDP可以简化为仅在转移/奖励函数或观测/奖励函数上变化的ME-POMDP，并设计了精确和近似（基于点）的算法。

Result: 成功为标准POMDP基准测试扩展到多环境设置计算了鲁棒策略，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ME-POMDP和AB-POMDP框架为处理模型不确定性提供了有效的理论和方法基础，所开发的算法能够实际应用于复杂环境中的鲁棒策略计算。

Abstract: Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) extend standard POMDPs with discrete
model uncertainty. ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the
same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their
transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance,
when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to
find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,
i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We
generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show
that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which
we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any
arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its
transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward
functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and
approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,
and thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard
POMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于测试时调优的框架，直接从串联质谱和分子式端到端生成分子结构，无需数据库匹配或中间步骤，在NPLIB1和MassSpecGym基准上分别比DiffMS方法提升100%和20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前串联质谱分析方法依赖数据库匹配或多步骤流程的局限性，特别是对于参考数据库中不存在的化合物识别困难的问题。

Method: 利用测试时调优增强预训练transformer模型，直接从串联质谱和分子式进行端到端的从头分子结构生成，无需人工标注和中间步骤。

Result: 在NPLIB1和MassSpecGym基准上分别超越DiffMS方法100%和20%，测试时调优在MassSpecGym上比传统微调提升62%的相对性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够动态适应新质谱，即使预测与真实值存在偏差，生成的分子候选结构仍然准确，为人工解释和更可靠的识别提供有价值指导。

Abstract: Tandem Mass Spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in
crucial fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and
environmental analysis. However, current methods rely on database matching from
previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require
intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct
molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference
databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning,
enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap,
enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the
tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and
intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on
two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively.
Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt
to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional
fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground
truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate,
providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable
identification.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管基础模型在计算机视觉和语言处理领域取得了突破，但在计算病理学中的应用却未能实现预期效果，存在系统性缺陷。

Method: 通过系统评估分析病理学基础模型的七个相互关联的缺陷原因。

Result: 发现当前病理学基础模型与组织形态学的本质存在概念性不匹配，表现出一系列根本性弱点。

Conclusion: 需要从根本上重新思考病理学基础模型的范式设计，以更好地适应人类组织的内在复杂性。

Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer
vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and
multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational
pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis,
prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic
evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor
robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning
safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues
that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions
underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic
complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified:
biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization,
excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation,
insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size.
These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain
conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a
fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.

*Zhenyu Zhang,Tianyi Chen,Weiran Xu,Alex Pentland,Jiaxin Pei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCAP是一个用于大语言模型的递归上下文感知推理和规划框架，通过计划分解、结构化父计划重注入和内存高效执行等机制，显著提升了长时程任务的推理和规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在处理需要多步推理和动态重规划的长时程任务时面临挑战，顺序提示方法容易出现上下文漂移、目标信息丢失和循环失败，而分层提示方法则削弱跨层级连续性或产生大量运行时开销。

Method: ReCAP结合了三个关键机制：(1) 提前计划分解，模型生成完整子任务列表，执行第一项并优化剩余部分；(2) 结构化父计划重注入，在递归返回时保持一致的多层级上下文；(3) 内存高效执行，限制活动提示使成本随任务深度线性扩展。

Result: 实验表明，ReCAP在各种长时程推理基准测试中显著提高了子目标对齐和成功率，在严格pass@1协议下，同步Robotouille任务提升了32%，异步Robotouille任务提升了29%。

Conclusion: ReCAP框架通过将高层目标与低层行动对齐、减少冗余提示和保持跨递归的连贯上下文更新，有效解决了长时程任务中的推理和规划挑战。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and dynamic re-planning
remain challenging for large language models (LLMs). Sequential prompting
methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent
failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level
continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive
Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared
context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key
mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full
subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii)
structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level
context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding
the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these
mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant
prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments
demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success
rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on
synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under
the strict pass@1 protocol.

Motivation: 解决共享环境中多个自主智能体在去中心化条件下的协调问题，这是机器人和人工智能领域的长期挑战。

Conclusion: 语言模型在多智能体路径规划的去中心化目标分配中具有潜力，信息结构在此类系统中至关重要。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under
decentralized conditions is a long-standing challenge in robotics and
artificial intelligence. This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal
assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate
ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the
environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this
reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are
determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent
index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We
systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large
language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our
results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts
and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and
consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the
potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent
path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such
systems.

Abstract: Agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work, but enterprises face
a harder challenge: moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver
measurable business value. This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks,
slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices.
Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic
benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and
modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings
remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting
the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the
community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a
hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond
benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing
talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability,
auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce
BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary
evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while
indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution
is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at
enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this
initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing
research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过变分推理和多样性强化学习，有效克服了确定性采样限制和奖励黑客问题，显著提升了LVLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the
interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not
generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased
reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as
posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on
amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement
learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for
token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent
CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking.
Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces
costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank
optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed
method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in
terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

Motivation: 现实应用中因果效应依赖于具体情境（年龄、国家、剂量、基因型等），需要形式化这种上下文依赖性

Method: 结合层理论和Lawvere-Tierney模态算子j，构建j-稳定因果推断框架，与基于分数、约束和梯度的因果发现方法结合

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了计算效率提升和性能改进，层理论因果发现的去中心化特性带来计算优势

Conclusion: judo calculus为上下文依赖的因果发现提供了形式化框架，在计算效率和性能上优于传统方法

Abstract: We describe a theory and implementation of an intuitionistic decentralized
framework for causal discovery using judo calculus, which is formally defined
as j-stable causal inference using j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves. In
real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science --
causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab
protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence
formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes,
not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which
regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and
consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation
framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based,
constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe
experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world
datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the
computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic
causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal
discovery methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为sign estimator的新方法，通过用二元分类损失替换交叉熵损失，解决了传统LLM对齐方法在人类偏好异质性下的不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM对齐方法对人类偏好的异质性很脆弱，拟合简单的概率模型到成对比较数据会产生不一致的群体平均效用估计。

Method: 使用sign estimator方法，在聚合步骤中用二元分类损失替换交叉熵损失，在温和假设下恢复一致的序数对齐。

Result: 在LLM对齐的数字孪生模拟中，sign estimator显著减少了偏好扭曲，将估计误差降低近35%，与真实群体偏好的不一致从12%降至8%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持现有LLM对齐管道实现简单性的同时，优于明确建模用户异质性的面板数据启发式方法。

Abstract: Traditional LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human
preferences. Fitting a na\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data
(say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the
population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a
new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably
consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary
classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers
consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first
polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations
of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces
preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular)
estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population
preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares
favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and
require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the
implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.

*Shangde Gao,Zelin Xu,Zhe Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种条件深度学习模型，通过结合个体的社会基础设施韧性(SIR)和空间上下文，来预测破坏性事件后个体移动模式的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测破坏性事件前个体移动模式的变化具有挑战性，因为缺乏衡量个体异质性社会基础设施韧性的方法，常用特征有限，个体移动与空间环境的复杂交互未被充分捕捉，且个体级移动数据稀疏不适合传统预测方法。

Method: 构建条件深度学习模型，将个体的社会基础设施韧性(SIR)纳入考虑，利用大规模稀疏的个体级数据捕捉个体移动模式与局部空间环境之间的复杂关系。

Result: 实验表明，结合个体的SIR和空间上下文可以增强模型预测事件后个体移动模式的能力。条件模型能够捕捉到具有相似事件前移动模式但SIR不同的个体在移动模式上的差异变化。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了将个体社会基础设施韧性和空间上下文结合到深度学习模型中的有效性，能够更好地预测破坏性事件后个体移动模式的变化。

Abstract: Shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal
changing demands for community resources. However, predicting such shifts
before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons. First,
measures are lacking for individuals' heterogeneous social infrastructure
resilience (SIR), which directly influences their movement patterns, and
commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale, e.g.,
sociodemographic characteristics. Second, the complex interactions between
individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently
captured. Third, individual-level movement may be spatially sparse and not
well-suited to traditional decision-making methods for movement predictions.
This study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model
to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and
local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context
can enhance the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement
patterns. The conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement
patterns among individuals who exhibit similar pre-event patterns but differ in
SIR.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了OneCast框架，通过将时间序列分解为季节性和趋势分量，分别使用轻量级投影模块和基于离散扩散的token化方法进行建模，实现了跨域时间序列预测的更好泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域时间序列预测方法在处理异构数据时面临挑战，特别是在面对特定领域趋势变化和不一致周期性模式时表现不佳，主要问题在于将时间序列视为未分化的序列而没有显式解耦其内在结构组件。

Method: OneCast框架将时间序列分解为季节性和趋势分量：季节性分量通过轻量级投影模块使用可解释基函数重建周期性模式；趋势分量通过语义感知tokenizer在分段级别编码为离散token，并通过掩码离散扩散机制进行推断。

Result: 在八个领域上的广泛实验表明，OneCast在大多数情况下优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过结构化分解时间序列并分别建模季节性和趋势分量，OneCast能够有效捕捉周期性模式并跟踪特定领域趋势，实现了跨域时间序列预测的显著改进。

Abstract: Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web
applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization
across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall
short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic
patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as
undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent
structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and
modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and
trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways.
Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection
module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions.
In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment
level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a
masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are
combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while
tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains
demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: LLMLogAnalyzer是一个基于聚类的日志分析聊天机器人，结合大语言模型和机器学习算法，简化日志分析流程，在多个任务中比现有LLM聊天机器人性能提升39%-68%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统日志是网络安全的核心，但分析大量多样的日志数据面临高成本、缺乏专业知识和时间限制等挑战，许多组织难以进行基本分析。

Method: 采用模块化架构，包括路由器、日志识别器、日志解析器和搜索工具，结合聚类技术和LLM，解决LLM的上下文窗口限制和结构化文本处理能力差的问题。

Result: 在四个不同领域日志和多种任务上的评估显示，相比ChatGPT、ChatPDF和NotebookLM等最先进的LLM聊天机器人，性能显著提升39%-68%，鲁棒性增强，使用ROUGE-1分数的四分位距减少93%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强LLM在结构化文本分析中的能力，提高了准确性和鲁棒性，为网络安全专家和非技术用户提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: System logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity, supporting proactive breach
prevention and post-incident investigations. However, analyzing vast amounts of
diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of
in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for
many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based
log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes.
This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context
window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling
more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks.
LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks.
Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art
LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent
gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits
strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when
using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The
framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a
router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM
capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and
robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and
non-technical users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动汽车的普及，需要理解其驾驶行为以提升交通安全和开发智能驾驶系统，特别是在与传统内燃机车辆混合行驶的环境下。

Method: 使用真实世界数据集，比较了IDM、OVM、OVRV、CACC等经典物理模型和随机森林回归器，通过最小化预测与实际数据的RMSE来校准模型参数。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，在不同跟车间距条件下的RMSE分别为0.0046（中等间距）、0.0016（长间距）和0.0025（超长间距）。在物理模型中，CACC表现最好，长间距RMSE为2.67。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在电动汽车跟驰行为建模中表现优异，对于模拟电动汽车行为和分析混合自动驾驶交通动态具有重要价值。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates an
understanding of their driving behavior to enhance traffic safety and develop
smart driving systems. This study compares classical and machine learning
models for EV car following behavior. Classical models include the Intelligent
Driver Model (IDM), Optimum Velocity Model (OVM), Optimal Velocity Relative
Velocity (OVRV), and a simplified CACC model, while the machine learning
approach employs a Random Forest Regressor. Using a real world dataset of an EV
following an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle under varied driving
conditions, we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the RMSE
between predictions and real data. The Random Forest model predicts
acceleration using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs. Results demonstrate
the Random Forest's superior accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap),
0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap). Among physics based models,
CACC performed best, with an RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps. These findings
highlight the machine learning model's performance across all scenarios. Such
models are valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed autonomy
traffic dynamics in EV integrated environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了让医生真正信任人工智能，需要消除AI的黑盒特性，使其推理过程像咨询同事一样透明可理解。

Method: 开发了HistoLens系统，能将医生的自然语言问题转化为精确的AI查询，提供结构化报告和热图可视化证据，并训练AI专注于患者组织而忽略背景噪声。

Result: 创建了一个透明协作的工作流程，病理学家保持专家主导地位，使用可信的AI助手验证见解并加速诊断过程。

Conclusion: 通过提供透明推理和可视化证据，HistoLens建立了医生对AI的信任，使病理学家能够更自信地使用AI辅助诊断，同时保持专业主导地位。

Abstract: For doctors to truly trust artificial intelligence, it can't be a black box.
They need to understand its reasoning, almost as if they were consulting a
colleague. We created HistoLens1 to be that transparent, collaborative partner.
It allows a pathologist to simply ask a question in plain English about a
tissue slide--just as they would ask a trainee. Our system intelligently
translates this question into a precise query for its AI engine, which then
provides a clear, structured report. But it doesn't stop there. If a doctor
ever asks, "Why?", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any
finding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for
its analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue,
just like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting
background noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the
expert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and
make faster, more confident diagnoses.

Motivation: 手动事件管理在大规模云系统中劳动密集且易出错，现有自动化方法难以跨系统泛化、可解释性有限且部署成本高，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 采用无训练数据处理器转换异构可观测数据为结构化文本描述，构建多代理协作框架实现透明诊断推理，并引入双自演进机制集成内部模型更新和外部经验积累。

Result: 在OPENRCA基准测试中表现出最先进的性能，证明OpsAgent具有可泛化性、可解释性、成本效益和自演进能力。

Conclusion: OpsAgent是一个实际可部署且可持续的解决方案，适用于现实世界云系统的长期运营。

Abstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud
systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and
traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and
heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often
struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and
incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper,
we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM
that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous
observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a
multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent
and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces
a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with
external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop.
Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable,
cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and
sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

Conclusion: 该自动化框架有效解决了多跳问答数据集的构建瓶颈，为训练高能力检索推理代理提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Building training-ready multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets that truly
stress a model's retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging
recently. While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture
the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring
the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data
resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them
unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL).
Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where
answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require
multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs
prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck
for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.
  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating
high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured
knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence
clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and
diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to
compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their
combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality
with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus
filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.
The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet
verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging
evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the
difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有MLLM在数字-物理空间和具身代理间泛化能力差，VLAs缺乏高层推理能力，ELLMs局限于数字空间。需要统一模型无缝跨空间操作并泛化到不同具身和任务。

Method: 两阶段训练：阶段I通过数字语料注入具身知识并保持语言能力；阶段II通过意图桥接接口训练策略模块，提取MLLM的高层语义指导控制，无需微调MLLM主干。

Result: 在数字和物理基准测试中，单个BLM₁实例优于MLLMs、ELLMs、VLAs和GMLMs四个模型家族，数字任务提升约6%，物理任务提升约3%。

Conclusion: BLM₁成功实现了跨空间、跨任务和跨具身的统一建模，为具身智能提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language
reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However,
significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical
spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level
actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large
language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor
generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate
seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across
embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large
Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves
instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and
supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key
capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and
cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I
injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while
maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an
intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to
guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported
by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot
embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital
and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four
model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving
$\sim\!\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\sim\!\textbf{3%}$ in physical
tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架成功证明了多数据集集成在自动驾驶规划中的可行性，通过统一的跨数据集学习方法显著提升了规划系统的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component of autonomous vehicle decision-making
systems, directly determining trajectory safety and driving efficiency. While
deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities, existing methods
remain confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in
planning.
  Through systematic analysis, we discover that vehicular trajectory
distributions and history-future correlations demonstrate remarkable
consistency across different datasets. Based on these findings, we propose
UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration
in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified
cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations.
  First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates
history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical
trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset
planning guidance.
  Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust
history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical
trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures
the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making
the planning knowledge safely transferable. Third, the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D)
paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors
during training for robust learning, while enabling full prior utilization
during inference to maximize planning performance.

Motivation: 现有GUI代理存在两个主要问题：对历史轨迹的依赖导致错误传播放大，以及"先决策后观察"机制忽略了关键界面线索。需要开发更鲁棒和通用的GUI交互方法。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting
across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the
development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web
interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms
typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical
trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine
planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by
two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies
error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first,
observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce
the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the
principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an
independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current
screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated
structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications
(Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves
substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art baselines. The code is publicly available at:

Motivation: MCTS的样本效率问题可以通过状态/动作抽象来解决，但现有方法如pruned OGA在抽象节点内多个动作具有相同UCB值时使用随机平局规则，这一情况未被注意到且存在改进空间。

Method: 提出并实证评估了多种替代的内部抽象策略，用于处理抽象节点内多个动作UCB值相同的情况。

Result: 多个提出的内部抽象策略在大多数环境和参数设置下表现优于随机策略。

Conclusion: 内部抽象策略的选择对MCTS性能有重要影响，提出的替代策略能够有效提升性能。

Abstract: One weakness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency which
can be addressed by building and using state and/or action abstractions in
parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of
the same layer. The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits
and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions
does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent
might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB
value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction
algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has
not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this
paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative
intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy
across a majority of environments and parameter settings.

Conclusion: LLM的内部行为已隐含其推理路径的可信度信息，基于相关矩阵秩的自我指示器方法能有效提升推理性能，且计算开销极小。

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they
are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs
effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their
applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources,
such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate
prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to
specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors
of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths.
Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input
problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning
correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the
calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which
avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated
prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method
to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance
improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few
computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales
and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It
achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from
incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning
benchmarks by more than 8%.

*Deniz Gorur,Antoni Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体框架的声明验证方法，通过不同智能体对声明真实性产生分歧并收集正反证据，使用定量双极论证框架表示证据，结合多种LLM智能体提升预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将判断性预测视为声明验证任务，需要评估未来事件的可能性。传统方法缺乏有效的证据整合和解释机制，需要一种能够处理分歧观点并提供可解释证据组合的方法。

Method: 设计多智能体框架，包括三种LLM智能体：ArgLLM（生成和评估QBAF）、RbAM（基于关系论证挖掘生成QBAF）、RAG-ArgLLM（结合检索增强生成的ArgLLM）。使用2-3个智能体组合，基于6种不同基础LLM进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，组合多个智能体的证据可以提升预测准确性，特别是在使用三个智能体时效果更佳，同时为声明验证提供了可解释的证据组合。

Conclusion: 多智能体框架能够有效整合不同来源的证据，在提升判断性预测准确性的同时提供可解释的决策依据，证明了多视角证据整合的价值。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events
based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification,
where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the
plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent
framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on
claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims,
represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then
instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of
agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an
existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;
(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)
from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,
extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of
arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two
standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with
two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that
combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in
the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of
evidence for claim verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管gLLMs在传播学内容分析中展现出超越人工编码者的潜力，但其在研究方法论中的整合仍不成熟，需要解决七个关键挑战以确保结果质量。

Method: 综合新兴研究，提出包含七个关键挑战的全面最佳实践指南：代码书开发、提示工程、模型选择、参数调优、迭代优化、可靠性验证和性能增强。

Result: gLLMs在传播学内容分析任务中能够超越众包工作者和训练有素的编码者，在时间和成本上具有显著优势，并能解码隐含意义和上下文信息。

Conclusion: 通过系统的最佳实践指南，可以使gLLM辅助的内容分析更易于传播学研究者使用，并确保符合有效性、可靠性、可重复性和研究伦理等学科质量标准。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly
being used in communication research for content analysis. Studies show that
gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research
assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at
a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit
meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language,
deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated
data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated
content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the
methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped. In
gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis, researchers must address at least
seven critical challenges that impact result quality: (1) codebook development,
(2) prompt engineering, (3) model selection, (4) parameter tuning, (5)
iterative refinement, (6) validation of the model's reliability, and
optionally, (7) performance enhancement. This paper synthesizes emerging
research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a
comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges. Our goal is to
make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to a broader range of
communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary
quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research
ethics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VDSAgents是一个基于PCS原则的多智能体系统，用于LLM驱动的数据科学自动化，在多个数据集上优于现有端到端系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM驱动的数据科学系统仅依赖LLM内部推理，缺乏科学理论指导，限制了其可信度和鲁棒性。

Method: 基于PCS原则构建多智能体系统，采用模块化工作流处理数据清洗、特征工程、建模和评估，结合扰动分析、单元测试和模型验证。

Result: 在9个不同特征的数据集上评估，VDSAgents持续优于AutoKaggle和DataInterpreter等最先进系统。

Conclusion: 将PCS原则嵌入LLM驱动的数据科学自动化是可行的，能显著提升系统性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into data science
workflows for automated system design. However, these LLM-driven data science
systems rely solely on the internal reasoning of LLMs, lacking guidance from
scientific and theoretical principles. This limits their trustworthiness and
robustness, especially when dealing with noisy and complex real-world datasets.
This paper provides VDSAgents, a multi-agent system grounded in the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles proposed in the
Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework. Guided by PCS principles, the system
implements a modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling,
and evaluation. Each phase is handled by an elegant agent, incorporating
perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation to ensure both
functionality and scientific auditability. We evaluate VDSAgents on nine
datasets with diverse characteristics, comparing it with state-of-the-art
end-to-end data science systems, such as AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, using
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o as backends. VDSAgents consistently outperforms the
results of AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, which validates the feasibility of
embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation.

Motivation: 现有脑-AI对齐研究局限于特定输入和任务，缺乏比较不同模态AI模型内在组织方式的统一框架。

Method: 通过映射AI模型内在空间注意力拓扑到人类功能脑网络，构建统一几何空间，分析151个Transformer模型。

Result: 发现模型在脑相似空间中呈连续弧形分布，脑相似度受预训练范式和位置编码方案影响，与下游任务性能不完全相关。

Conclusion: 脑相似空间为跨领域智能提供了首个统一量化比较框架，揭示了机器与大脑之间的深层组织原则。

Abstract: For decades, neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared
ambition: to understand intelligence and build it. Modern artificial neural
networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is
still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as
the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking
correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to
specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI
models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are
intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of
Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be
precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention
topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks,
regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis
of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models,
large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous
arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of
brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within
this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not
merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes
global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme
facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of
brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not
"identical twins". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework
for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains,
revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the
brain.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体生态系统用于N-of-1决策支持，旨在解决当前医疗AI系统对罕见病例和边缘人群表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗AI系统主要服务于平均患者，在罕见变异、多病共存和代表性不足人群上表现不佳，这损害了公平性和信任度。

Method: 构建多智能体生态系统，按器官系统、患者群体和分析模式聚类智能体，共享模型库和证据合成工具，通过协调层整合结果并评估可靠性、不确定性和数据密度。

Result: 系统提供带有置信区间的风险评估、异常值标记和相关证据的决策支持包，验证重点从群体平均转向个体可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过从单一模型转向协调智能，该方法旨在使医疗AI与医学首要原则保持一致：透明、公平且以个体为中心的护理。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By
minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate
accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants,
multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy
erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent
ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by
organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared
library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a
coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density
before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates
bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation
shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in
low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs.
Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and
regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and
adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated
intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle
of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the
individual.

TL;DR: Policy Cards是一种机器可读的部署层标准，用于表达AI代理的操作、监管和伦理约束，使其能够在运行时遵循所需约束，成为部署代理的组成部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决AI代理在部署和运行时缺乏明确的约束表达机制的问题，扩展现有透明度工具（如模型卡、数据卡、系统卡），为自主代理提供可验证的合规性基础。

Method: 通过定义规范层来编码允许/拒绝规则、义务、证据要求和与NIST AI RMF、ISO/IEC 42001、欧盟AI法案等保证框架的映射关系，每个Policy Card可自动验证、版本控制，并链接到运行时执行或持续审计管道。

Result: Policy Cards为自主代理提供了可验证的合规性机制，在多代理生态系统中形成分布式保证的基础，实现了高层治理与工程实践的实际整合。

Conclusion: Policy Cards提供了一种实用机制，将高层治理与工程实践相结合，实现了大规模的可问责自主性，为AI代理的合规部署和运行提供了标准化解决方案。

Abstract: Policy Cards are introduced as a machine-readable, deployment-layer standard
for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents.
The Policy Card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required
constraints at runtime. It tells the agent what it must and must not do. As
such, it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent. Policy Cards extend
existing transparency artifacts such as Model, Data, and System Cards by
defining a normative layer that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations,
evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks
including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and the EU AI Act. Each Policy Card can
be validated automatically, version-controlled, and linked to runtime
enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines. The framework enables verifiable
compliance for autonomous agents, forming a foundation for distributed
assurance in multi-agent ecosystems. Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism
for integrating high-level governance with hands-on engineering practice and
enabling accountable autonomy at scale.

TL;DR: Orion是一个高效推理框架，通过依赖感知的查询分解和逻辑并行内容扩展，解决LLM在实时Web应用中的延迟和吞吐量挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理存在计算效率低和推理策略僵化的问题，无法同时满足实时Web服务对高质量推理和低延迟的双重要求。

Method: 将查询推理分为两个协同阶段：关键点生成（通过检索增强的少样本提示生成逻辑结构化的关键点）和内容并行扩展（基于依赖图并行扩展内容以确保逻辑一致性），并引入流水线调度机制实现跨查询并行。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Orion相比基线实现了最高4.33倍的token生成速度提升、3.42倍的答案延迟降低，以及18.75%的推理质量提升。

Conclusion: Orion通过显式建模关键点间的依赖关系，在提高推理效率的同时显著提升了推理质量，为LLM在实时Web应用中的部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time Web
applications, such as AI-powered search and conversational agents, presents a
fundamental Web infrastructure challenge: reconciling the demand for
high-quality, complex reasoning with the stringent low-latency and
high-throughput requirements of interactive services. Current LLM reasoning,
hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid
reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services.
Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency
or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual
requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware
query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion
decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)
\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points
through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \textit{content
parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a
dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a
pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational
characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing
and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling
cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\ie,
efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not
only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer
latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%
through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前预训练基准主要关注孤立静态技能，无法反映模型的智能体能力；而智能体基准通常针对后训练模型，基础模型难以支持多轮任务执行，需要能在预训练阶段评估智能体潜力的基准

Method: 将真实世界智能体任务和成功轨迹转换为多选题或文本补全问题，专注于规划和行动等核心智能体能力，覆盖软件工程和深度研究等关键场景

Result: 相比现有通用基准，APTBench能更准确地预测模型作为智能体的下游性能，同时比后训练阶段的端到端智能体评估更轻量、成本更低

Conclusion: APTBench填补了预训练阶段智能体能力评估的空白，为更有效地指导模型训练提供了工具

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to
incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to
better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current
pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g.,
common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's
agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically
designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities
that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a
benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide
the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench,
a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories
into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It
focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key
agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing
general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a
model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more
lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations
after post-training.

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents can effectively simulate legal systems, reproducing macro-level crime trends and providing insights for legal system design, especially in protecting vulnerable individuals.

Abstract: Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating
legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective
alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting
legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge
and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation
for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate
legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,
an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual
decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and
enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with
real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce
macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world
observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a
well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better
protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.

Conclusion: 该模式语言为工程化代理提供了可扩展、自适应和可互操作的自动化能力，适用于Web及其扩展资源。

Abstract: The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability
to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that
defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of
web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing
this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the
verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by
foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations
prevents agents from adapting to evolving services.
  This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured
data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction
Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a
verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model
optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia
Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its
world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and
integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these
patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently
construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive,
and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.

Motivation: 解决SNN在复杂控制任务中面临的两个关键挑战：非可微脉冲神经元需要替代梯度但优化特性不明确，以及SNN的有状态动态需要在序列上训练，但在强化学习中早期训练序列长度有限阻碍网络度过预热期。

Method: 系统分析替代梯度斜率设置，发现较浅斜率增加深层梯度幅度但减少与真实梯度对齐；提出利用特权引导策略引导学习过程的新训练方法，同时保持脉冲策略的在线环境交互；结合自适应斜率调度。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对SNN中替代梯度学习的理论理解，并为神经形态控制器的实际训练方法提供了创新，在真实机器人系统中得到验证。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained
robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling
native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a
promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to
complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable
nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear
optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training
on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited
sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging
its warm-up period.
  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient
slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in
deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,
we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much
more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead
to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we
propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to
bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment
interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive
slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an
average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,
including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points
under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical
understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training
methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种成本效益高的两阶段流程，通过跨任务示例和基于图的标签传播方法减少对LLM数据标注的依赖，降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为新颖或困难任务收集高质量示例成本高昂且劳动密集，需要减少对LLM标注的依赖。

Method: 两阶段流程：首先利用跨任务示例通过LLM伪标注少量目标任务实例，然后使用基于图的标签传播方法将标签信息传播到剩余目标示例中，无需额外LLM查询。

Result: 在五个任务上的实验表明，该方法在降低标注成本的同时实现了强劲性能。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了跨任务监督的灵活性和无LLM传播的可扩展性，为ICL提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: The capability of in-context learning (ICL) enables large language models
(LLMs) to perform novel tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a
few input-output examples. However, collecting high-quality examples for new or
challenging tasks can be costly and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a
cost-efficient two-stage pipeline that reduces reliance on LLMs for data
labeling. Our approach first leverages readily available cross-task examples to
prompt an LLM and pseudo-label a small set of target task instances. We then
introduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information
to the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting
fully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for
ICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the
scalability of LLM-free propagation. Experiments across five tasks demonstrate
that our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm. It
promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing
practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical
note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that
integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for
decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the
delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with
great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby
improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare
requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot
be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design
and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the
data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational
substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to
sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse
medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing
pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables
GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical
applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with
high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific
fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support
task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the
deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.

TL;DR: FunReason-MT是一个用于生成多轮工具调用训练数据的新框架，解决了现有方法在真实环境中的不足，通过环境-API图交互、高级工具查询合成和引导迭代链来生成高质量数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据合成方法（如随机环境采样或多智能体角色扮演）无法在真实环境中生成高质量的多轮工具调用数据，存在目标模型训练、工具架构隔离和多轮逻辑依赖等实际挑战。

Method: FunReason-MT采用三种核心技术：1）环境-API图交互收集多样化高质量轨迹；2）高级工具查询合成简化复杂查询构建；3）引导迭代链生成复杂的思维链。

Result: 在Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3)上，基于FunReason-MT生成数据训练的4B模型在同类模型中达到最先进性能，优于大多数闭源模型。在BFCLv4上的进一步性能改进证实了其可靠性。

Conclusion: FunReason-MT为智能体学习提供了可靠且鲁棒的数据源，能够有效解决多轮工具调用数据生成的复杂性障碍。

Abstract: Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving
complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to
advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to
develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods,
such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not
powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments.
Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of
tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these
structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis
framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the
complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph
Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query
Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain
for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling
Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built
upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among
comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further
performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a
reliable and robust source for agentic learning.

Abstract: Site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops has advanced rapidly through
machine and deep learning (ML and DL) for real-time computer vision. Research
evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature
learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed
in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate
visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about
symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and
educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables
field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM
applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning
(AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted
spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in
2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL
and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can
simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is
critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains
limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early
symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with
real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM. For updates, resources, and

Abstract: Agentic tool use has gained traction with the rise of agentic tool calling,
yet most existing work overlooks the complexity of multi-turn tool
interactions. We introduce OrchDAG, a synthetic data generation pipeline that
models tool execution as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with controllable
complexity. Using this dataset, we benchmark model performance and propose a
graph-based reward to enhance RLVR training. Experiments show that the dataset
presents a challenging but solvable benchmark, and the proposed reward is
effective when combined with GRPO-style algorithms, highlighting the importance
of leveraging topological structure and data complexity in multi-turn tool use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用工具与文档之间的依赖关系来生成高质量的范例工件，需要一种统一框架来建模工具交互并整合领域知识。

Method: 从工具模式构建工具知识图谱，从内部文档和SOP构建补充知识图谱，然后将两者融合，采用深度稀疏集成策略对齐工具结构依赖与程序知识来生成范例计划。

Conclusion: 通过融合工具知识图谱和文档知识图谱，该框架显著提升了工具增强推理和规划的效果，为范例工件生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present a framework for uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools
and documents to enhance exemplar artifact generation. Our method begins by
constructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas,including descriptions,
arguments, and output payloads, using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis. In
parallel, we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and
SOPs, which is then fused with the tool graph. To generate exemplar plans, we
adopt a deep-sparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool
dependencies with procedural knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that this
unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan
generation, underscoring the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain
knowledge graphs for tool-augmented reasoning and planning.
