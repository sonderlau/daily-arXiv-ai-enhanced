### [1] [AI-boosted rare event sampling to characterize extreme weather](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27066)
*Amaury Lancelin,Alex Wikner,Laurent Dubus,Clément Le Priol,Dorian S. Abbot,Freddy Bouchet,Pedram Hassanzadeh,Jonathan Weare*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 提出AI+RES算法，结合AI天气模拟器、罕见事件采样算法和全球气候模型，以30-300倍的低成本生成可靠的极端天气统计数据和相关动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测数据集太短，基于物理的全球气候模型计算成本太高，难以获得最罕见但最具影响力的极端事件的稳健统计数据。AI模拟器在训练数据中缺乏极端事件示例时表现不佳。

Method: 使用AI天气模拟器的集合预报作为评分函数，指导全球气候模型的高效重采样，生成稳健的极端天气统计数据和动力学。

Result: AI+RES在中纬度热浪这一具有挑战性的测试案例中表现出色，需要评分函数具有多天前的预测能力。算法实现了30-300倍的成本降低。

Conclusion: AI+RES通过协同整合AI、RES和GCMs，为气候科学及其他研究罕见事件和AI模拟器的学科提供了一个强大、可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Assessing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and
understanding how climate change affects them, is crucial for developing
effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, observational datasets
are too short and physics-based global climate models (GCMs) are too
computationally expensive to obtain robust statistics for the rarest, yet most
impactful, extreme events. AI-based emulators have shown promise for
predictions at weather and even climate timescales, but they struggle on
extreme events with few or no examples in their training dataset. Rare event
sampling (RES) algorithms have previously demonstrated success for some extreme
events, but their performance depends critically on a hard-to-identify "score
function", which guides efficient sampling by a GCM. Here, we develop a novel
algorithm, AI+RES, which uses ensemble forecasts of an AI weather emulator as
the score function to guide highly efficient resampling of the GCM and generate
robust (physics-based) extreme weather statistics and associated dynamics at
30-300x lower cost. We demonstrate AI+RES on mid-latitude heatwaves, a
challenging test case requiring a score function with predictive skill many
days in advance. AI+RES, which synergistically integrates AI, RES, and GCMs,
offers a powerful, scalable tool for studying extreme events in climate
science, as well as other disciplines in science and engineering where rare
events and AI emulators are active areas of research.

### [2] [A Hierarchical Deep Learning Model for Predicting Pedestrian-Level Urban Winds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27101)
*Reda Snaiki,Jiachen Lu,Shaopeng Li,Negin Nazarian*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于预测城市行人级风场的分层方法，采用两阶段预测-精炼框架，结合U-Net和条件GAN来恢复高频细节，显著提高了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的深度学习代理模型只能产生低频预测，缺失关键的高频细节如尖锐梯度和峰值风速，影响城市风场预测的准确性。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用U-Net从城市几何生成基线预测；第二阶段使用条件GAN精炼基线预测，通过多尺度架构恢复缺失的高频内容。

Result: 在UrbanTALES数据集上验证，相比基线预测器显著提升性能，RMSE在训练集上降低76%，验证集上降低60%，能更好地解析高速风射流和复杂湍流尾迹。

Conclusion: 该方法为城市规划、行人舒适度评估和风安全分析中的代理模型提供了有效且鲁棒的预测保真度提升方案，将集成到Feilian Version 2交互式网络平台中。

Abstract: Deep learning-based surrogate models offer a computationally efficient
alternative to high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for
predicting urban wind flow. However, conventional approaches usually only yield
low-frequency predictions (essentially averaging values from proximate pixels),
missing critical high-frequency details such as sharp gradients and peak wind
speeds. This study proposes a hierarchical approach for accurately predicting
pedestrian-level urban winds, which adopts a two-stage predictor-refiner
framework. In the first stage, a U-Net architecture generates a baseline
prediction from urban geometry. In the second stage, a conditional Generative
Adversarial Network (cGAN) refines this baseline by restoring the missing
high-frequency content. The cGAN's generator incorporates a multi-scale
architecture with stepwise kernel sizes, enabling simultaneous learning of
global flow structures and fine-grained local features. Trained and validated
on the UrbanTALES dataset with comprehensive urban configurations, the proposed
hierarchical framework significantly outperforms the baseline predictor. With a
marked qualitative improvement in resolving high-speed wind jets and complex
turbulent wakes as well as wind statistics, the results yield quantitative
enhancement in prediction accuracy (e.g., RMSE reduced by 76% for the training
set and 60% for the validation set). This work presents an effective and robust
methodology for enhancing the prediction fidelity of surrogate models in urban
planning, pedestrian comfort assessment, and wind safety analysis. The proposed
model will be integrated into an interactive web platform as Feilian Version 2.

### [3] [Using data assimilation tools to dissect GraphDOP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27388)
*Patrick Laloyaux,Mihai Alexe,Eulalie Boucher,Peter Lean,Ewan Pinnington,Simon Lang,Tobias Necker,Anthony McNally*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 将数据同化诊断工具应用于机器学习模型，探索GraphDOP模型的可解释性，验证其能捕捉真实物理过程并分析不同观测数据对预报误差的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据同化社区开发了多种诊断工具来理解观测系统在天气预报中的重要性，这些工具依赖于计算物理模型输出对初始条件的导数。本文旨在将这些诊断工具转移到机器学习模型中，因为机器学习模型可以通过自动微分轻松获得导数。

Method: 将数据同化诊断工具（如预报敏感度观测影响FSOI）应用于ECMWF开发的GraphDOP模型，利用自动微分技术分析模型的可解释性和可解释性。

Result: 可解释性研究表明GraphDOP的滑动注意力窗口能有效学习观测数据集中的气象特征和不同区域间的空间关系，证实了模型捕捉真实物理过程（如风暴系统移动）的能力。可解释性分析显示GraphDOP通过结合常规和卫星观测信息创建了地球系统的内部表示。

Conclusion: 数据同化诊断工具成功应用于机器学习模型，验证了GraphDOP模型能够学习有物理意义的气象特征，并为理解机器学习模型在天气预报中的应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: The Data Assimilation (DA) community has been developing various diagnostics
to understand the importance of the observing system in accurately forecasting
the weather. They usually rely on the ability to compute the derivatives of the
physical model output with respect to its initial condition. For example, the
Forecast Sensitivity-based Observation Impact (FSOI) estimates the impact on
the forecast error of each observation processed in the DA system. This paper
presents how these DA diagnostic tools are transferred to Machine Learning (ML)
models, as their derivatives are readily available through automatic
differentiation. We specifically explore the interpretability and
explainability of the observation-driven GraphDOP model developed at the
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The
interpretability study demonstrates the effectiveness of GraphDOP's sliding
attention window to learn the meteorological features present in the
observation datasets and to learn the spatial relationships between different
regions. Making these relationships more transparent confirms that GraphDOP
captures real, physically meaningful processes, such as the movement of storm
systems. The explainability of GraphDOP is explored by applying the FSOI tool
to study the impact of the different observations on the forecast error. This
inspection reveals that GraphDOP creates an internal representation of the
Earth system by combining the information from conventional and satellite
observations.

### [4] [Spatial Controls of Lower Tropospheric Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27575)
*Senne Van Loon,Maria Rugenstein*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究分析了海洋低云对地球辐射预算的重要性，发现低层对流层稳定性（EIS）受局部和远程地表温度变化的复杂影响，揭示了控制浅云特征的动力学机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋低云在地球辐射预算中起关键作用，但过去几十年浅云覆盖的演变尚不清楚。研究旨在理解控制低云覆盖的主要因素——低层对流层稳定性（EIS）如何受温度变化影响。

Method: 通过量化区域EIS对局部和远程地表温度的依赖性，分析不同气候模型和再分析数据中地表温度与EIS的空间关系。

Result: 发现全球EIS在热带上升区随变暖而增加，在下沉区随变暖而减少。在东南太平洋，1980年以来观测到的EIS增加完全归因于远程变暖，局部冷却并未增加该区域的稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究结果质疑了西太平洋暖池在控制东太平洋低云反馈中的主导地位，为理解地表温度模式对辐射反馈的空间依赖性提供了机制性见解。

Abstract: Marine low clouds play a crucial role in Earth's radiation budget. These
clouds efficiently reflect sunlight and drive the magnitude and sign of the
global cloud feedback. Despite their relevance, the evolution of shallow cloud
decks over the last decades is not well understood. One of the dominant
controls of this low cloud cover is the lower tropospheric stability,
quantified by the estimated inversion strength (EIS). Here, we quantify how
regional EIS depends on local and remote surface temperature, revealing the
dynamics controlling the characteristics of shallow clouds. We find that global
EIS increases with warming in tropical regions of ascent and decreases with
warming in regions of descent, as expected. In addition to the West Pacific
Warm Pool, the Atlantic convection regions and the central Pacific are
important predictors. Focusing on subtropical ocean upwelling regions in
different ocean basins, where the low cloud decks reside, EIS increases with a
fairly complex pattern of remote warming and decreases with local warming. The
spatial relationship between surface temperature and EIS is robust across
different climate models and reanalyses, allowing us to constrain the large
spread in estimates of historical EIS trends. In the Southeast Pacific, where
historical temperature trends are not well understood, we attribute the
observed increased EIS since 1980 entirely to remote warming, indicating that
local cooling did not increase stability in this region. Our results put into
question the dominance of the West Pacific Warm Pool in controlling low cloud
feedbacks in the eastern Pacific and give insights into mechanisms underlying
the spatial dependence of radiative feedbacks on surface temperature patterns.

### [5] [Spiking Neural Networks: The Future of Brain-Inspired Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27379)
*Sales G. Aribe Jr*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该研究对脉冲神经网络(SNNs)进行了全面分析，比较了不同训练方法在准确性、能耗、延迟和收敛性等方面的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs作为新一代神经计算模型，相比传统人工神经网络具有更高的能效和时序动态特性，适合能量受限、延迟敏感的智能应用。

Method: 深入研究了LIF等关键神经元模型，以及替代梯度下降、ANN到SNN转换、STDP等训练策略，并采用多维度性能指标进行评估。

Result: 替代梯度训练的SNNs准确率接近ANNs(差距1-2%)，收敛更快(20个周期)，延迟低至10毫秒；转换SNNs性能竞争但需要更多脉冲；STDP-SNNs能耗最低(5毫焦耳/推理)，适合低功耗任务。

Conclusion: SNNs经过进一步改进后，有望推动神经形态计算的下一个发展阶段，特别适合机器人、神经形态视觉和边缘AI等应用。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent the latest generation of neural
computation, offering a brain-inspired alternative to conventional Artificial
Neural Networks (ANNs). Unlike ANNs, which depend on continuous-valued signals,
SNNs operate using distinct spike events, making them inherently more
energy-efficient and temporally dynamic. This study presents a comprehensive
analysis of SNN design models, training algorithms, and multi-dimensional
performance metrics, including accuracy, energy consumption, latency, spike
count, and convergence behavior. Key neuron models such as the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and training strategies, including surrogate gradient
descent, ANN-to-SNN conversion, and Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP),
are examined in depth. Results show that surrogate gradient-trained SNNs
closely approximate ANN accuracy (within 1-2%), with faster convergence by the
20th epoch and latency as low as 10 milliseconds. Converted SNNs also achieve
competitive performance but require higher spike counts and longer simulation
windows. STDP-based SNNs, though slower to converge, exhibit the lowest spike
counts and energy consumption (as low as 5 millijoules per inference), making
them optimal for unsupervised and low-power tasks. These findings reinforce the
suitability of SNNs for energy-constrained, latency-sensitive, and adaptive
applications such as robotics, neuromorphic vision, and edge AI systems. While
promising, challenges persist in hardware standardization and scalable
training. This study concludes that SNNs, with further refinement, are poised
to propel the next phase of neuromorphic computing.

### [6] [Exploiting heterogeneous delays for efficient computation in low-bit neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27434)
*Pengfei Sun,Jascha Achterberg,Zhe Su,Dan F. M. Goodman,Danyal Akarca*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现，在脉冲神经网络中学习突触延迟而不仅仅是权重，可以在极低精度权重（1.58位三元精度）下实现最先进的性能，为神经形态计算提供高效解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络主要关注学习突触权重，但忽略了大脑中存在的其他可学习参数，特别是异质性延迟。大脑利用异步信号传输的复杂时间动态，这种延迟异质性可能在具身环境中被利用来处理时间域中的任务相关信息。

Method: 训练脉冲神经网络同时修改权重和不同精度的延迟，研究延迟异质性如何影响网络性能，特别是在极低精度权重条件下的表现。

Result: 延迟异质性使网络在时间复杂的神经形态问题上达到最先进性能，即使在权重极其不精确（1.58位三元精度）的情况下也能保持高精度。延迟异质性允许比典型仅权重网络更激进的权重压缩（超过一个数量级），同时保持内存效率。

Conclusion: 时间异质性是高效计算的重要原则，特别是在任务相关信息具有时间特性的物理世界中。这对具身智能系统和神经形态硬件具有重要意义，表明延迟学习可以弥补低精度权重的不足。

Abstract: Neural networks rely on learning synaptic weights. However, this overlooks
other neural parameters that can also be learned and may be utilized by the
brain. One such parameter is the delay: the brain exhibits complex temporal
dynamics with heterogeneous delays, where signals are transmitted
asynchronously between neurons. It has been theorized that this delay
heterogeneity, rather than a cost to be minimized, can be exploited in embodied
contexts where task-relevant information naturally sits contextually in the
time domain. We test this hypothesis by training spiking neural networks to
modify not only their weights but also their delays at different levels of
precision. We find that delay heterogeneity enables state-of-the-art
performance on temporally complex neuromorphic problems and can be achieved
even when weights are extremely imprecise (1.58-bit ternary precision: just
positive, negative, or absent). By enabling high performance with extremely
low-precision weights, delay heterogeneity allows memory-efficient solutions
that maintain state-of-the-art accuracy even when weights are compressed over
an order of magnitude more aggressively than typically studied weight-only
networks. We show how delays and time-constants adaptively trade-off, and
reveal through ablation that task performance depends on task-appropriate delay
distributions, with temporally-complex tasks requiring longer delays. Our
results suggest temporal heterogeneity is an important principle for efficient
computation, particularly when task-relevant information is temporal - as in
the physical world - with implications for embodied intelligent systems and
neuromorphic hardware.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一个有效的神经架构搜索空间，以ResNet为基础框架，同时考虑网络精度和验证集损失，实现更优的网络架构自动搜索。

Method: 使用ResNet作为搜索框架，搜索卷积层、池化层、全连接层的参数配置以及残差网络的连接方式，将验证集损失作为次要优化目标进行多目标优化。

Conclusion: 基于ResNet的搜索空间结合验证集损失优化策略，能够有效发现高性能的神经网络架构，在多个标准数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural architecture search space using ResNet as a
framework, with search objectives including parameters for convolution,
pooling, fully connected layers, and connectivity of the residual network. In
addition to recognition accuracy, this paper uses the loss value on the
validation set as a secondary objective for optimization. The experimental
results demonstrate that the search space of this paper together with the
optimisation approach can find competitive network architectures on the MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.

### [8] [A Hybrid Deep Learning and Forensic Approach for Robust Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27392)
*Sales Aribe Jr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种融合法医特征和深度学习表示的混合框架，用于深度伪造检测，在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，并在压缩、对抗攻击和未知操作下保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成对抗网络和扩散模型的快速发展使合成媒体越来越逼真，引发了关于错误信息、身份欺诈和数字信任的社会担忧。现有深度伪造检测方法要么依赖深度学习但泛化能力差且易受失真影响，要么依赖法医分析但可解释性强却难以应对新操作技术。

Method: 提出混合框架，融合法医特征（包括噪声残差、JPEG压缩痕迹和频域描述符）与深度学习表示（来自卷积神经网络和视觉变换器）。

Result: 在FaceForensics++、Celeb-DF v2和DFDC数据集上分别获得0.96、0.82和0.77的F1分数，在压缩（QF=50时F1=0.87）、对抗扰动（AUC=0.84）和未知操作（F1=0.79）下表现稳定。可解释性分析显示Grad-CAM和法医热图在82%情况下与真实操作区域重叠。

Conclusion: 混合方法提供了平衡解决方案，结合了深度模型的适应性和法医线索的可解释性，可开发具有弹性和可信度的深度伪造检测系统。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal
concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing
deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from
poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,
which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This
study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise
residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep
learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF
v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines
and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.
Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87
at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations
(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and
forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82
percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm
that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability
of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient
and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

### [9] [Do Vision-Language Models Measure Up? Benchmarking Visual Measurement Reading with MeasureBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26865)
*Fenfen Lin,Yesheng Liu,Haiyu Xu,Chen Yue,Zheqi He,Mingxuan Zhao,Miguel Hu Chen,Jiakang Liu,JG Yao,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MeasureBench基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在读取测量仪器方面的能力，发现即使最先进的模型在这方面也存在困难，特别是在指针定位方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类读取测量仪器相对容易且不需要太多专业知识，但当前视觉语言模型在这方面表现不佳，需要建立一个专门的基准来评估和改进这一能力。

Method: 开发了MeasureBench基准，包含真实世界和合成图像，并建立可扩展的数据合成流程，可控地生成各种类型的测量仪表，包括指针、刻度、字体、光照等细节变化。

Result: 评估显示即使是前沿的视觉语言模型在测量读取方面也普遍困难，主要失败模式是指针定位错误，导致数值误差。在合成数据上的强化学习实验显示有希望的结果，但对真实图像效果有限。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在细粒度空间定位方面存在根本性局限，该资源有助于推动视觉基础计算能力和精确空间感知的发展，弥合数字识别与世界测量之间的差距。

Abstract: Reading measurement instruments is effortless for humans and requires
relatively little domain expertise, yet it remains surprisingly challenging for
current vision-language models (VLMs) as we find in preliminary evaluation. In
this work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading
covering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of
measurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our
pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable
visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers,
scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and
open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle
measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator
localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key
positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite
plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments
with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results
on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images. Our
analysis highlights a fundamental limitation of current VLMs in fine-grained
spatial grounding. We hope this resource can help future advances on visually
grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception of VLMs, bridging the gap
between recognizing numbers and measuring the world.

*Rochak Dhakal,Chen Zhao,Zixin Shi,Joyce H. Keyak,Tadashi S. Kaneko,Kuan-Jui Su,Hui Shen,Hong-Wen Deng,Weihua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对多机构定量CT的领域自适应transformer分割框架，通过对抗对齐和统计对齐解决跨机构数据分布差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在不同机构的CT数据上表现不稳定，由于扫描设备、重建设置和患者群体的差异导致领域偏移，影响骨密度分析和骨折风险评估的可靠性。

Method: 基于3D TransUNet架构，集成梯度反转层进行对抗对齐以减少站点特定特征，同时使用最大均值差异进行统计对齐以减小机构间分布差异。

Result: 在包含1,024个Tulane大学和384个Rochester扫描的大型髋部骨折研究队列上训练和验证，实现了跨机构的稳定分割性能。

Conclusion: 该双机制方法平衡了不变性和细粒度对齐，实现了扫描设备无关的特征学习，同时保留了解剖细节，为多中心骨质疏松研究提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone
strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density
distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation
models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one
dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain
shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary
across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable
quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center
osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite
element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we
developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for
multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the
largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT
images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for
proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two
complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment
via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding
site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.
This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling
scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.

*Moonsoo Jeong,Dongbeen Kim,Minseong Kim,Sungkil Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于方向一致性的自适应密度控制方法DC4GS，通过梯度角度一致性来优化3D高斯泼溅中的基元分裂策略，减少冗余分裂并提高重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自适应密度控制仅基于位置梯度大小进行基元分裂，忽略了梯度的方向一致性，导致冗余分裂和次优的基元布局。

Method: 将梯度方向一致性引入自适应密度控制，通过梯度角度一致性来指导基元分裂决策，并在需要分裂时利用方向一致性确定最优分裂位置。

Result: 相比现有方法，DC4GS显著减少了基元数量（实验中最高达30%），同时大幅提升了重建保真度。

Conclusion: 方向一致性是优化3D高斯泼溅中自适应密度控制的关键因素，能够有效减少冗余基元并提升重建质量。

Abstract: We present a Directional Consistency (DC)-driven Adaptive Density Control
(ADC) for 3D Gaussian Splatting (DC4GS). Whereas the conventional ADC bases its
primitive splitting on the magnitudes of positional gradients, we further
incorporate the DC of the gradients into ADC, and realize it through the
angular coherence of the gradients. Our DC better captures local structural
complexities in ADC, avoiding redundant splitting. When splitting is required,
we again utilize the DC to define optimal split positions so that
sub-primitives best align with the local structures than the conventional
random placement. As a consequence, our DC4GS greatly reduces the number of
primitives (up to 30% in our experiments) than the existing ADC, and also
enhances reconstruction fidelity greatly.

*Yi Luo,Yike Guo,Hamed Hooshangnejad,Kai Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种尺度自适应课程学习(SACL)方法，用于在数据稀缺的临床环境中改进肺结节检测模型的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在临床部署时面临标注数据有限的问题，传统静态课程学习策略在数据稀缺场景下效果不佳。

Method: SACL包含三个关键机制：自适应epoch调度、困难样本注入和尺度感知优化，能够根据可用数据规模动态调整课程设计。

Result: 在LUNA25数据集上，SACL在完整数据集上性能与静态课程学习相当，但在数据受限条件下显著优于基线，在10%、20%和50%训练数据时分别提升4.6%、3.5%和2.0%。

Conclusion: SACL能够在不同数据规模下实现鲁棒训练，无需架构修改，为医疗机构的肺结节检测系统开发提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI
remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning
models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and
high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address
these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive
framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is
built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a
Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention
fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity
mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction
strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and
difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different
challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022
Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a
state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH
dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a
statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it
reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These
experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a
robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation. The source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SFAT模型用于直播视频评论生成，通过语义帧聚合和权重分配机制，优先处理与观众互动相关的视频帧，并构建了大规模英文视频评论数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了优先处理与观众互动最相关的视频帧，这对于生成上下文适当的评论至关重要。

Method: SFAT模型利用CLIP的视觉-文本多模态知识，基于语义相关性为视频帧分配权重，采用加权求和技术强调信息丰富的帧，并使用交叉注意力机制的评论解码器。

Result: 构建了包含11个视频类别、438小时时长、320万条评论的大规模英文数据集，SFAT模型在生成直播视频评论方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SFAT模型通过语义帧聚合和权重分配机制，有效提升了直播视频评论生成的上下文相关性。

Abstract: Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like
Twitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However,
automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a
challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data
and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important
aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer
interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually
appropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame
Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.
This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to
generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their
semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient
weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing
less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention
mechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment
reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the
limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language
content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,
diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this
dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million
comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to
existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue
contexts.

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在缓解遗忘、增强对交互漂移的鲁棒性以及零样本HOI泛化方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的IRD框架在动态环境中有效解决了增量HOI检测的关键挑战，为开放世界人-物交互理解提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve
continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models.
Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore
incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning
human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not
only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but
also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI
combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel
exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples
the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation
losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI
combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET
and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness
against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs. Code is

Motivation: 针对自动驾驶场景中道路场景的空间和几何复杂性，需要专门优化的语义分割模型来提升分割精度和泛化能力。

Method: 采用双编码器架构结合SAM的ViT-H全局语义和ResNet-50局部空间细节，使用可变形融合模块对齐异构特征，通过可变形注意力进行多阶段精炼，采用混合损失函数优化训练。

Conclusion: 通过对基础模型进行针对性的架构和优化增强，可以实现可靠且可扩展的自动驾驶感知系统。

Abstract: This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a
fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous
driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a
dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric
complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused
representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained
Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable
convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion
module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The
decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention.
Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice,
Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary
precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and
Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM,
Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in
segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on
Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by
margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes,
respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a
0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning
dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of
benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting
data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm
that targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models
enable reliable and scalable AD perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiT是一种新颖的分层神经场表示方法，通过无监督学习在3D形状中学习从粗到细的通用层次结构，使用分层transformer和压缩码本自动识别跨类别的共同子结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常局限于固定的层次结构（如二叉树），无法灵活适应不同形状类别的复杂层次关系，需要一种能够从数据中自动推断层次结构的方法。

Method: 提出分层transformer（HiT），每个层级使用压缩码本学习树层次结构的父子关系，不限制具体层次结构类型，只限制每层节点总数，通过重建损失进行训练。

Result: 在55个ShapeNet类别上进行无监督形状分割任务，成功将形状分割为多个粒度级别的部分，捕捉到了有意义的父子包含关系。

Conclusion: HiT能够灵活地从数据中推断复杂层次结构，在跨类别形状分析中表现出色，为3D形状理解提供了更通用的分层表示方法。

Abstract: We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D
shapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across
different shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is
a hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child
relationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook
enables the network to automatically identify common substructures across
potentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the
task to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such
restriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level.
This flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly
from data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and
complex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a
reconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships
between parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an
unsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our
method successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.

TL;DR: ZEBRA是首个零样本脑视觉解码框架，无需受试者特定适应，通过对抗训练解耦fMRI表征中的受试者相关和语义相关成分，实现跨受试者泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前fMRI到图像重建方法主要依赖受试者特定模型或需要受试者特定微调，限制了可扩展性和实际应用。

Method: 利用对抗训练将fMRI表征分解为受试者相关和语义相关成分，分离出受试者不变、语义特定的表征。

Result: ZEBRA在多项指标上显著优于零样本基线，达到与完全微调模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了向通用神经解码的可扩展和实用步骤。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual
experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a
promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current
methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require
subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain
visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific
adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be
decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging
adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to
isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This
disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any
additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA
significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance
comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a
scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model
weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了WildfireX-SLAM数据集，这是一个用于森林场景SLAM的大规模合成数据集，旨在解决3D高斯溅射在森林环境SLAM中缺乏高质量数据集的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发3DGS-based SLAM方法在大型森林场景中的应用具有重要现实意义，特别是在野火应急响应和森林管理方面，但缺乏全面高质量的数据集阻碍了相关研究。

Method: 利用Unreal Engine 5 Electric Dreams环境样本项目，开发了一个管道来收集空中和地面视图，包括真实相机位姿和多种数据模态，并可灵活控制环境因素如光照、天气和野火类型。

Result: 构建了WildfireX-SLAM数据集，包含5.5k张低空RGB-D航空图像，覆盖16平方公里的森林地图，并进行了全面的基准测试。

Conclusion: 该数据集揭示了森林环境中3DGS-based SLAM的独特挑战，并为未来工作指明了改进方向，数据集和代码将公开提供。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to
remarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most
recent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing
3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for
many real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and
forest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of
a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over
real-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have
built a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM
in wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric
Dreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect
aerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of
additional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also
provides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and
types and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks
covering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting
pilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images
from a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of
WildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals
the unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights
potential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Project page: https://zhicongsun.github.io/wildfirexslam.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型需要大规模训练数据和大量计算资源，或者结构复杂延迟高。目标是开发一个高效轻量的多模态扩散模型，降低训练资源需求。

Method: 采用高度压缩的视觉分词器生成紧凑表示；提出多路径压缩模块进一步压缩token；引入位置增强保持空间连贯性；使用交替子区域注意力降低计算成本；提出AdaLN-affine高效调制模块。

Result: 在单节点8个AMD MI300X GPU上，仅用25M公开数据训练1.5天，512px生成在GenEval上达到0.66分，使用GRPO后可达0.72分。

Conclusion: E-MMDiT为未来研究提供了强大实用的基准，有助于生成式AI模型的民主化。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality
images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale
training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from
heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal
Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal
diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring
low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with
competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M
public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on
GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as
GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational
cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive
visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel
multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our
design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional
information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention
(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce
computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient
lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.
Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT
serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes
to democratization of generative AI models.

Motivation: 现有方法在跨视图信息传递方面效果不佳，未能有效精炼空间关系特征图，导致模型错误关注无关边缘噪声，影响定位性能。

Method: 引入跨视角交叉注意力模块(CVCAM)进行多轮视图间交互，集成多头空间注意力模块(MHSAM)提取多尺度空间特征，并创建G2D数据集填补地面到无人机定位任务空白。

Result: 在CVOGL和G2D数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法实现了高定位精度，超越了当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的CVCAM和MHSAM模块能有效促进跨视图信息交互、抑制无关噪声，并增强查询物体的特征表示，为跨视角物体地理定位任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization has recently gained attention due to
potential applications. Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of
query objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain
spatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object
locations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer
information between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship
feature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge
noise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),
which performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,
enabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the
query object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of
cross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the
query object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module
(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract
multi-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit
correspondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query
object. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object
geo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the "Ground-to-Drone"
localization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in
"Ground-to-Drone" localization task. Extensive experiments on the CVOGL and G2D
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high localization
accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有方法大多采用单步生成过程，难以在场景复杂度和用户输入之间取得平衡。受人类从全局到局部、关注关键元素并通过语义关联完成场景的认知过程启发。

Method: 引入渐进式层次空间语义图(PHiSSG)，动态组织空间关系和语义依赖，通过图节点与生成对象的一对一映射以及递归布局优化来确保空间和几何一致性。

Result: 实验表明HiGS在布局合理性、风格一致性和用户偏好方面优于单阶段方法。

Conclusion: HiGS为高效3D场景构建提供了可控且可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming,
film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step
generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with
minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling,
which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes
the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical
generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition.
HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic
objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model
completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent
generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph
(PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic
dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and
geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a
one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting
recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms
single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user
preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D
scene construction.

Conclusion: AFM-Net通过CNN和Mamba的有效融合，成功解决了遥感图像场景分类中的多尺度特征建模问题，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task,
primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics
of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local
textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However,
efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational
cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced
Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global
co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting
hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence
modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion
Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both
pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual
reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused
features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier
module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained
scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that
AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency. Code is

Method: 将每个Banff指标分解为结构和炎症成分，使用现有分割和检测工具评估其计算可行性，通过启发式规则将模型输出映射到Banff评分。

Result: 研究发现了部分成功和关键失败模式，包括结构遗漏、幻觉和检测模糊性。即使最终评分与专家标注匹配，中间表示的不一致性也常损害可解释性。

Conclusion: 当前AI流程在复制计算专家级分级方面存在局限性，模块化评估和计算Banff分级标准对于指导移植病理学未来模型开发至关重要。

Abstract: The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal
transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and
inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational
replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff
lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based
framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),
peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its
constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current
segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs
are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert
guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings
highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including
structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final
scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate
representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the
limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level
grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational
Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant
pathology.

*Hankyeol Lee,Gawon Seo,Kyounggyu Lee,Dogun Kim,Kyungwoo Song,Jiyoung Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉语言模型、大语言模型和物体检测系统的多阶段流程，用于生成高分辨率图像的详细描述，减少幻觉并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型通常基于低分辨率图像预训练，在处理高分辨率图像时会丢失细节和遗漏重要物体，导致生成的描述不够准确和详细。

Method: 采用多阶段流程：先用VLM生成初始描述，LLM识别关键物体并预测可能共现的物体，物体检测系统验证预测，对未提及的新检测物体进行区域特定描述生成，最终整合所有信息。

Result: 在精选的高分辨率图像数据集上实验表明，该流程能生成更详细可靠的图像描述，同时有效减少幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 通过整合多种AI模型的多阶段流程，能够显著提升高分辨率图像描述的准确性和详细程度，同时降低幻觉风险。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and
detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically
pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels).
Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss
of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models,
large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption
quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage
process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated
using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The
LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key
objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly
detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,
region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process
enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to
undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison
and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark
for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of
high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and
reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.

*Xiaozhi Li,Huijun Di,Jian Li,Feng Liu,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M^3Detection是一个统一的多帧3D目标检测框架，通过相机和4D成像雷达的多模态数据融合，解决了单帧融合方法信息不完整的问题，同时通过轨迹引导的特征聚合和时空推理模块提高了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的相机-雷达融合方法大多局限于单帧输入，只能捕捉场景的部分信息。不完整的场景信息加上图像退化和4D雷达稀疏性，阻碍了整体检测性能。多帧融合虽然能提供更丰富的时空信息，但面临跨帧跨模态特征融合和计算成本高的挑战。

Method: 提出M^3Detection框架：1) 利用基线检测器的中间特征和跟踪器生成参考轨迹；2) 设计雷达引导的全局级目标间特征聚合模块；3) 局部级网格间特征聚合模块沿参考轨迹扩展局部特征；4) 轨迹级多帧时空推理模块编码跨帧交互。

Result: 在VoD和TJ4DRadSet数据集上的广泛实验表明，M^3Detection实现了最先进的3D检测性能，验证了其在相机-4D成像雷达多帧检测中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多级特征融合和时空推理，有效解决了多帧相机-雷达融合中的挑战，显著提升了3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse
weather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the
these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D
perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to
single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete
scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,
hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers
richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust
and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and
mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.
Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object
detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal
data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate
features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce
reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer
information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level
inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align
global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature
aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories
to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then
processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to
encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection
achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its
effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

TL;DR: 提出DANCER框架，基于稳定视频扩散模型实现真实单人舞蹈合成，通过外观增强模块和姿态渲染模块提升生成质量，并构建TikTok-3K数据集增强训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成特别是涉及人体舞蹈的内容具有挑战性，因为人体运动自由度很高，需要确保视频连续性和质量。

Method: 基于稳定视频扩散模型，引入外观增强模块(AEM)关注参考图像细节，姿态渲染模块(PRM)扩展运动引导，并构建TikTok-3K数据集。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型性能优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DANCER框架通过条件增强和渲染有效提升了舞蹈视频生成的质量和连续性。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual
generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have
been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only
has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in
ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,
human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to
generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via
Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic
single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion
model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a
video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully
benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance
Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image
during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering
Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve
the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video
data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model
training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our
model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and
codes will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2-Cache是一种新颖的分层缓存机制，通过将去噪过程分离为结构定义和细节精炼两个阶段，使用双阈值系统选择性缓存，解决了扩散模型推理速度与质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但其迭代去噪过程计算成本高昂。现有缓存技术在加速推理时往往面临速度与保真度之间的困难权衡，存在质量下降和高计算开销的问题。

Method: 提出H2-Cache分层缓存机制，基于去噪过程可功能分离为结构定义阶段和细节精炼阶段的洞察，采用双阈值系统选择性缓存每个阶段。引入池化特征摘要(PFS)技术进行轻量级相似性估计。

Result: 在Flux架构上的广泛实验表明，H2-Cache实现了显著加速（最高5.08倍），同时保持与基线几乎相同的图像质量，在定量和定性上都优于现有缓存方法。

Conclusion: H2-Cache提供了一个稳健实用的解决方案，有效解决了速度-质量困境，显著降低了高保真扩散模型在实际应用中的门槛。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but
their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of
their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can
accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed
and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel
hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model
architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising
process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a
detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold
system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure
the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature
summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity
estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that
H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining
image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a
robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality
dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of
high-fidelity diffusion models. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SilhouetteTell是一种新型视频识别攻击，通过分析字幕轮廓的空间和时间特征来识别视频内容，能够远程推断在线和离线视频，最远距离可达40米。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频识别攻击会严重威胁用户隐私，可能泄露观看者的兴趣爱好、宗教信仰、政治倾向、性取向和健康状况等敏感信息，这些信息可能被用于用户画像、广告投放，甚至导致网络欺凌、歧视或敲诈。

Method: 通过观察字幕内容决定其在屏幕上显示的轮廓，识别每个字幕轮廓并计算连续字幕之间的时间差，将空间和时间域信息结合成字幕轮廓的时空特征，探索录制视频字幕轮廓与其字幕文件之间的时空相关性。

Result: 在现成智能手机上的综合实验证实了SilhouetteTell在各种设置下推断视频标题和片段的高效性，包括从最远40米的距离。

Conclusion: SilhouetteTell通过结合字幕轮廓的时空特征，提供了一种有效的视频识别攻击方法，能够远程识别视频内容，对用户隐私构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Video identification attacks pose a significant privacy threat that can
reveal videos that victims watch, which may disclose their hobbies, religious
beliefs, political leanings, sexual orientation, and health status. Also, video
watching history can be used for user profiling or advertising and may result
in cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail. Existing extensive video
inference techniques usually depend on analyzing network traffic generated by
streaming online videos. In this work, we observe that the content of a
subtitle determines its silhouette displayed on the screen, and identifying
each subtitle silhouette also derives the temporal difference between two
consecutive subtitles. We then propose SilhouetteTell, a novel video
identification attack that combines the spatial and time domain information
into a spatiotemporal feature of subtitle silhouettes. SilhouetteTell explores
the spatiotemporal correlation between recorded subtitle silhouettes of a video
and its subtitle file. It can infer both online and offline videos.
Comprehensive experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones confirm the high
efficacy of SilhouetteTell for inferring video titles and clips under various
settings, including from a distance of up to 40 meters.

Motivation: 现有挖掘或重加权策略使用静态权重，对分布偏移敏感且容易过早过度强调困难样本，导致噪声梯度和不稳定收敛

Method: DPHR策略包含样本级的基于比率的难度感知模块评估相对难度并分配细粒度权重，以及批次级的渐进自适应损失加权机制利用训练进度信号在早期优化中衰减噪声梯度并在训练成熟时逐步增强困难负样本挖掘

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200基准测试上验证了DPHR的有效性和鲁棒性，相比最先进方法获得了一致性改进

Conclusion: DPHR策略通过双重渐进式重加权机制有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的困难负样本问题，提升了模型性能和训练稳定性

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery
remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples.
Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is
sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples
too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper,
we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy.
At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates
relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch
level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a
training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization
and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments
on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集反演方法试图重建整个图像区域，在反演大规模视觉Transformer的高分辨率图像时效率极低，主要原因是冗余反演噪声背景和虚假相关（幻觉现象）。

Method: 提出稀疏模型反演策略作为即插即用扩展，选择性反演语义前景，停止反演噪声背景和潜在虚假相关，无需修改原始损失函数。

Result: 实现了显著的反演加速（高达3.79倍），同时在数据无关模型量化和数据无关知识迁移中保持可比甚至增强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 稀疏模型反演策略有效解决了密集反演的低效问题，在保持性能的同时大幅提升反演速度。

Abstract: Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from
pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original
training data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints.
However, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire
image area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution
images from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two
underlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy
backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon
we term "hallucination" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension
to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their
original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic
foregrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential
spurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we
validate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion
acceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced
downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge
transfer. Code is available at https://github.com/Egg-Hu/SMI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了多模态交互式真实性评估任务(MIVA)，基于狼人杀游戏构建了包含同步视频、文本和真实标签的数据集，评估发现当前最先进的多模态大语言模型在区分真假陈述方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统日益融入人类生活，赋予它们强大的社会智能变得至关重要。其中关键方面是辨别真假，这在人类互动中普遍存在，通过语言和非语言视觉线索的复杂交互传达。

Method: 引入新的多模态交互式真实性评估任务(MIVA)，构建基于狼人杀游戏的多模态数据集，包含同步视频、文本和可验证的真实标签，并建立基准评估最先进的多模态大语言模型。

Result: 评估显示存在显著的性能差距：即使是GPT-4o这样的强大模型也难以可靠地区分真假。模型未能有效将语言与视觉社交线索关联，且可能因对齐过度而过于保守。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型在真实性检测方面存在明显不足，迫切需要新方法来构建更具洞察力和可信度的AI系统。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them
with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key
aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous
element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of
verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception
detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant
challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding,
makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities
in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we
introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and
present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game
Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable
ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark
evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:
even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood
reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to
ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly
conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel
approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land
relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual
disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes
have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a
single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its
influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These
efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and
insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper
proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates
multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial
morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and
communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic
communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal
features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on
existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper
introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training
strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method
achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in
multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint
optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83
(independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our
method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and
generative logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像诊断中构建鲁棒且泛化性强的模型面临挑战，主要由于大规模精确标注数据稀缺以及医疗环境中固有的领域偏移问题。特别是在胸部CT中，不同窗口设置针对不同临床目的优化，导致领域偏移。传统方法通过重用过去数据缓解领域偏移，但受隐私限制通常不可行。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效学习多样化特征，缓解领域偏移问题，同时确保数据隐私，为医学图像诊断提供了实用的持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了SpecAware，一种新颖的高光谱光谱内容感知基础模型，通过超网络驱动的编码过程统一多传感器学习，解决了高光谱成像数据异质性和多传感器训练的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像数据固有的异质性长期以来阻碍了通过联合训练开发通用模型，现有方法通常忽视传感器元属性的关键指导作用，并且在多传感器训练方面存在困难，限制了其可迁移性。

Method: 采用两步超网络驱动编码过程：1) 元内容感知模块，融合传感器元属性和图像内容为每个HSI图像块生成独特的条件输入；2) HyperEmbedding模块，通过样本条件超网络动态生成矩阵因子对进行通道级编码，包括自适应空间模式提取和潜在语义特征重投影。

Conclusion: SpecAware能够感知和解释跨不同场景和传感器的空间-光谱特征，自适应处理可变数量的光谱通道，建立了联合预训练的统一框架。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a vital tool for fine-grained land-use and
land-cover (LULC) mapping. However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has
long posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.
Although HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream
tasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of
sensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their
transferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a
novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying
multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K
dataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality
benchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS
sensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding
process for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to
generate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each
spectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own
image content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a
sample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors
for channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction
and latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to
perceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and
sensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable
number of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint
pre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware
can learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic
segmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.

This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLOv11, the recent advancement in
the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing on its application to joint
building extraction and discrete height classification from satellite imagery.
YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more
efficient architecture that better combines features at different scales,
improves object localization accuracy, and enhances performance in complex
urban scenes. Using the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset -- which includes over 125,000
annotated buildings across 12 cities -- we evaluate YOLOv11's performance using
metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP).
Our findings demonstrate that YOLOv11 achieves strong instance segmentation
performance with 60.4\% mAP@50 and 38.3\% mAP@50--95 while maintaining robust
classification accuracy across five predefined height tiers. The model excels
in handling occlusions, complex building shapes, and class imbalance,
particularly for rare high-rise structures. Comparative analysis confirms that
YOLOv11 outperforms earlier multitask frameworks in both detection accuracy and
inference speed, making it well-suited for real-time, large-scale urban
mapping. This research highlights YOLOv11's potential to advance semantic urban
reconstruction through streamlined categorical height modeling, offering
actionable insights for future developments in remote sensing and geospatial
intelligence.

Conclusion: MoRE通过混合专家架构成功解决了3D模型扩展的挑战，实现了高性能和鲁棒性，为3D视觉任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in language and vision have demonstrated that scaling up
model capacity consistently improves performance across diverse tasks. In 3D
visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven
effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of
3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the
diversity of 3D data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoRE, a dense
3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to
specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and
adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE
incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and
refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic
features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity
surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss
functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple
geometric tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective
downstream applications without extra computation.

TL;DR: Object-IR是一种自监督的图像重定向方法，通过基于网格的变形优化来消除语义重要区域的几何失真，无需手动标注数据。


<details>

Motivation: 解决图像重定向中语义重要区域几何失真的难题，传统方法难以有效保持重要物体的外观一致性。

Method: 将图像重定向重新定义为基于学习的网格变形优化问题，使用CNN预测网格运动，结合对象一致性损失、几何保持损失和边界损失进行约束。

Conclusion: Object-IR通过自监督学习有效解决了图像重定向中的几何失真问题，在保持语义对象外观的同时实现了高效处理。

Abstract: Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an
intractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a
self-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a
learning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is
guided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.
Given an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid
mesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict
the motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted
result is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in
the input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate
geometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function
incorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic
objects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain
simple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce
a clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates
the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision
directly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive
evaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative
metrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently
processes arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for
1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade
GPUs. The source code will soon be available at

Conclusion: FuseCPath框架能够有效融合异构病理基础模型，提升整体性能，为计算病理学中的全切片图像分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential
technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological
foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving
meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.
However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity
caused by diverse private training datasets and different network
architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we
utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To
fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we
propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,
called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The
main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To
guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a
multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via
multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online
capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the
connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung
cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合空间和频域方法的两阶段训练防御策略，通过离散小波变换分析频域特征，使用transformer层融合空间和小波特征进行去噪，然后重新训练分类器，显著提升了对抗攻击下的分类准确率。

Motivation: 深度神经网络在安全关键系统中容易受到对抗攻击的威胁，限制了其实际应用。现有方法在防御对抗攻击方面存在不足，需要开发更有效的防御机制。

Method: 两阶段训练方法：第一阶段训练结合空间和频域的去噪网络，利用离散小波变换分析频域特征，通过transformer层融合空间图像特征和小波特征；第二阶段使用去噪后的图像重新训练分类器。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和Fashion-MNIST数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了分类准确率，性能明显优于单独使用去噪网络和对抗训练的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段训练方法通过结合空间和频域特征进行去噪，有效提升了深度神经网络对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，为安全关键应用提供了可行的防御方案。

Abstract: In recent times, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully adopted
for various applications. Despite their notable achievements, it has become
evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks,
restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we
present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the
denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel
denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches
to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that
high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted
compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising
network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a
transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images,
which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks.
Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets
reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy,
substantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and
adversarial training approaches. The code is available at

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in computer
vision tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection.
However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect
predictions with small perturbations in input images. Addressing this issue is
crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel
approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a
previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function
to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both
clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters
alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust
representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental
results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various
types of adversarial perturbations. This suggests that contrastive loss helps
extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of
adversarial robustness in deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在零样本动作识别中仅依赖动作类别提供语义上下文时存在挑战，特别是多语义词会引入概念模糊性，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 利用网络爬取的描述，通过大型语言模型提取相关关键词，减少人工标注需求；引入时空交互模块关注对象和动作单元，促进描述属性与视频内容的对齐。

Result: 在零样本实验中，模型在UCF-101、HMDB-51和Kinetics-600数据集上分别达到81.0%、53.1%和68.9%的准确率，展示了良好的适应性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用网络描述和语言模型有效解决了多语义词导致的模糊性问题，在多个下游任务中表现出色，证明了其在实际应用中的价值。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
zero-shot action recognition by learning to associate video embeddings with
class embeddings. However, a significant challenge arises when relying solely
on action classes to provide semantic context, particularly due to the presence
of multi-semantic words, which can introduce ambiguity in understanding the
intended concepts of actions. To address this issue, we propose an innovative
approach that harnesses web-crawled descriptions, leveraging a large-language
model to extract relevant keywords. This method reduces the need for human
annotators and eliminates the laborious manual process of attribute data
creation. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module
designed to focus on objects and action units, facilitating alignment between
description attributes and video content. In our zero-shot experiments, our
model achieves impressive results, attaining accuracies of 81.0%, 53.1%, and
68.9% on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-600, respectively, underscoring the
model's adaptability and effectiveness across various downstream tasks.

TL;DR: RegionRAG是一个多模态检索增强生成框架，通过从文档级检索转向区域级检索来解决视觉文档中大量无关内容的问题，显著提高了检索和问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态RAG方法将整个文档作为检索单元，导致大量无关视觉内容被引入：1）相关文档中包含与查询无关的大区域；2）检索多个文档会引入冗余和无关文档，这些冗余上下文分散模型注意力并降低性能。

Method: 提出RegionRAG框架，将检索范式从文档级转向区域级。训练时设计混合监督策略从标注和未标注数据中精确定位相关图像块；推理时提出动态管道将显著图像块智能分组为完整语义区域。

Result: 在六个基准测试上达到最先进性能：平均R@1检索准确率提升10.02%，问答准确率提升3.56%，同时仅使用先前方法71.42%的视觉标记。

Conclusion: 通过将识别相关区域的任务委托给检索器，RegionRAG使生成器能够专注于与查询相关的简洁视觉内容，提高了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a critical method
for empowering LLMs by leveraging candidate visual documents. However, current
methods consider the entire document as the basic retrieval unit, introducing
substantial irrelevant visual content in two ways: 1) Relevant documents often
contain large regions unrelated to the query, diluting the focus on salient
information; 2) Retrieving multiple documents to increase recall further
introduces redundant and irrelevant documents. These redundant contexts
distract the model's attention and further degrade the performance. To address
this challenge, we propose \modelname, a novel framework that shifts the
retrieval paradigm from the document level to the region level. During
training, we design a hybrid supervision strategy from both labeled data and
unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches. During inference, we propose a
dynamic pipeline that intelligently groups salient patches into complete
semantic regions. By delegating the task of identifying relevant regions to the
retriever, \modelname enables the generator to focus solely on concise visual
content relevant to queries, improving both efficiency and accuracy.
Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that RegionRAG achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02\% in R@1 on
average and increases question answering accuracy by 3.56\% while using only
71.42\% visual tokens compared to prior methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: 医学影像中，预训练模型具有鲁棒性但缺乏模态特性，微调模型在分布内准确但抗模态偏移能力差。现有模型合并方法在医学领域表现不稳定。

Method: T^3框架使用Jensen-Shannon散度计算每样本的插值系数，无需反向传播。T^3_B扩展为批次级计算以降低推理成本。

Conclusion: T^3为临床环境中的自适应多模态视觉语言模型部署开辟了新途径，代码已开源。

Abstract: In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality:
pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific
characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution
accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques,
designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to
deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static
interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we
introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free
framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3
dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to
generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of
sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that
computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing
computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized
medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol
spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.
Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error
reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving
the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings. Our code is

Motivation: 当前GUI代理模型缺乏对自身能力边界的认知，导致过度自信和不可靠预测，这在动态GUI自动化任务中尤为关键，单个错误就可能导致任务失败

Method: 提出HyperClick框架，引入双奖励机制：正确动作的二元奖励和基于截断高斯分布的空间置信度建模，使用Brier分数进行校准，联合优化定位准确性和置信度可靠性

Result: 在七个挑战基准测试上的广泛实验表明，HyperClick实现了最先进的性能，同时提供了良好校准的置信度

Conclusion: 通过显式置信度校准和内省式自我批评，HyperClick减少了过度自信，支持更可靠的GUI自动化

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI
grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to
execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of
their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable
predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized
confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between
confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI
automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this,
we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding
through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism,
combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based
spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach
jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering
introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge
benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while
providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence
calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence
and supports more reliable GUI automation.

Motivation: 现有方法要么均匀采样，要么使用检索式评分进行关键帧选择，但需要预过滤以减少推理成本，可能错过最具信息量的时刻。

Method: 将关键帧选择建模为组合纯探索问题，将短时间片段视为臂，使用经验均值和伯恩斯坦置信半径识别信息丰富区域，采用两阶段探索-利用策略。

Result: 在两个长视频问答基准测试中，FOCUS处理少于2%的视频帧即可实现准确性大幅提升，在超过20分钟的视频上，LongVideoBench准确率提升11.9%。

Conclusion: FOCUS为MLLMs的可扩展长视频理解提供了一个简单通用的解决方案，证明了其作为关键帧选择方法的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as
visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however,
inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines
therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with
retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these
keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to
reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a
training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects
query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe
selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed
bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and
Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving
exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage
exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with
theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then
selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video
question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements
while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20
minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and
general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

Conclusion: 语义引导的对抗样本生成策略能有效解决现有概念擦除方法在扩散模型中的局限性，实现更高效和精确的概念擦除。

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in
diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a
novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial
training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood
of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of
adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this
work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of
concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept
space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual
semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting
of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there
are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object
concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.
Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE
(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging
semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and
perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art
methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM
unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure
performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training
time by 90%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Qhong-522/S-GRACE.

Abstract: Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing
mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image
analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying
cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality
can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery
Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline
comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel
multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham
method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by
0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using
the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network
built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational
Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of
narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further
suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a
combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic
arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an
IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a

Method: 提出门控注意力增强状态空间模块(GASM)和金字塔频率融合模块(PFFM)，结合状态空间建模、双分支注意力机制和FFT引导的多分辨率频率融合。

Result: 在五种医学成像模态上评估，FGMamba在PSNR/SSIM指标上优于CNN和Transformer方法，参数量小于0.75M。

Conclusion: 频率感知状态空间建模为可扩展且准确的医学图像增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image super-resolution (SR) is essential for enhancing diagnostic
accuracy while reducing acquisition cost and scanning time. However, modeling
both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details with
low computational overhead remains challenging. We propose FGMamba, a novel
frequency-aware gated state-space model that unifies global dependency modeling
and fine-detail enhancement into a lightweight architecture. Our method
introduces two key innovations: a Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module
(GASM) that integrates efficient state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial
and channel attention, and a Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that
captures high-frequency details across multiple resolutions via FFT-guided
fusion. Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities
(Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, and Endoscopic) demonstrate that FGMamba achieves
superior PSNR/SSIM while maintaining a compact parameter footprint ($<$0.75M),
outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based SOTAs. Our results validate the
effectiveness of frequency-aware state-space modeling for scalable and accurate
medical image enhancement.

### [52] [Generative Semantic Coding for Ultra-Low Bitrate Visual Communication and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27324)
*Weiming Chen,Yijia Wang,Zhihan Zhu,Zhihai He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合文本生成和深度图像压缩的超低比特率视觉通信方法，在保持视觉分析精度的同时大幅降低带宽需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在极端低带宽场景（如深空探测、战场情报）下，现有文本到图像生成模型只能实现语义级近似而无法满足精确视觉通信需求的问题

Method: 将图像生成与深度图像压缩无缝集成，使用联合文本和编码潜在来指导修正流模型，实现视觉场景的精确生成

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持相同图像重建质量和视觉分析精度的前提下，使用的带宽远少于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法为超低比特率视觉通信提供了一种有效解决方案，能够在极端带宽限制下实现精确的视觉场景重建

Abstract: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote
vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with
very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield
intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we
ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual
scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding
methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance
of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new
approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only
achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far
insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis
and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to
seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint
text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise
generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent
are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image
reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while
using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段微调流程，用于将开源视频扩散变换器适配到影视制作中的电影场景合成，通过LoRA模块实现高效视觉风格学习，然后生成风格一致的关键帧并扩展为连贯视频序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在小型数据集上微调视频扩散模型以生成电影级场景的挑战，实现高效的视觉风格迁移和运动生成分离。

Method: 两阶段流程：第一阶段使用LoRA模块在交叉注意力层中微调Wan2.1 I2V-14B模型，实现视觉风格学习；第二阶段生成风格一致的关键帧，通过视频解码器扩展为720p序列，并应用轻量级并行化和序列分区策略加速推理。

Conclusion: 提出的训练和推理流程能够有效支持电影领域的适应和复制，实现了在单GPU上几小时内完成高效领域迁移。

Abstract: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion
transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production
from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style
learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B
model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short
clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables
efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage,
the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve
costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into
coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply
lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate
inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study,
demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal
stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is
released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出P²IOD方法，通过参数化提示来解决增量目标检测中的类别共现问题，实现自适应知识整合并防止灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示池的方法假设增量任务中的类别集是互斥的，这忽略了检测图像中固有的类别共现现象。在共现场景中，先前任务的未标记对象可能出现在当前任务图像中，导致提示池混淆。

Method: P²IOD利用神经网络的全局演化特性，将网络作为参数化提示来自适应整合跨任务知识。为了约束提示结构更新，还采用了参数化提示融合策略。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC2007和MS COCO数据集上的大量实验表明，P²IOD在增量目标检测中有效，并在现有基线中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 参数化提示结构应具有跨任务的自适应整合特性，通过约束更新来防止灾难性遗忘，P²IOD方法在增量目标检测中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into
pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the
application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains
underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class
sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook
the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring
scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task
images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that
prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across
tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated
by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection
(P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD
employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate
knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD
further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments
on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's
effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among
existing baselines.

Motivation: 内窥镜视频中可变形组织重建面临组织运动导致的混叠和伪影问题，现有3D高斯泼溅方法重渲染速度而忽视这些问题，影响可视化质量。

Method: 提出SAGS框架，包含注意力驱动的动态加权4D变形解码器，利用3D平滑滤波器和2D Mip滤波器来减轻伪影并更好地捕捉组织运动的精细细节。

Result: 在EndoNeRF和SCARED两个公开基准测试中，所有PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标均优于现有最先进方法，同时提供更好的可视化质量。

Conclusion: SAGS框架在可变形内窥镜场景重建中有效解决了混叠和伪影问题，实现了更高质量的组织运动重建和可视化。

Abstract: Surgical reconstruction of dynamic tissues from endoscopic videos is a
crucial technology in robot-assisted surgery. The development of Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has greatly advanced deformable tissue reconstruction,
achieving high-quality results from video and image sequences. However,
reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes remains challenging due to aliasing
and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which can significantly degrade
visualization quality. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has
improved reconstruction efficiency by enabling a faster rendering pipeline.
Nevertheless, existing 3DGS methods often prioritize rendering speed while
neglecting these critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose SAGS,
a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework. We introduce an
attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D
smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue
reconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement.
Experimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and
LPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better
visualization quality.

TL;DR: 该论文审计了乳腺癌肿瘤分割数据集MAMA-MIA中自动分割标签的公平性，发现存在针对年轻患者的年龄相关偏见，这种偏见在控制混杂因素后仍然存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型旨在改善诊断工作流程，但在图像分割等任务中的公平性评估仍未被充分探索。未解决的分割偏见可能导致对某些人群的护理质量差异，并在临床决策点和迭代模型开发中被放大。

Method: 作者审计了乳腺癌肿瘤分割数据集MAMA-MIA中自动分割标签的公平性，评估了跨年龄、种族和数据来源的自动分割质量。

Result: 分析揭示了针对年轻患者的内在年龄相关偏见，即使在控制数据来源等混杂因素后仍然存在。同时发现聚合多个数据来源会影响特定站点的种族偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在细粒度层面调查数据的必要性，年龄偏见可能与生理因素相关，这是放射科医生和自动化系统都面临的已知挑战。

Abstract: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解决部分相关视频检索中语义坍缩问题的新框架，通过文本相关性保持学习和跨分支视频对齐来防止查询和视频嵌入的语义坍缩，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将所有标注的文本-视频对视为正样本，其他视为负样本，忽略了单个视频内和不同视频间的丰富语义变化，导致同一视频中不同事件的查询和视频片段嵌入坍缩在一起，而语义相似的查询和片段被推远，限制了多事件视频的检索性能。

Method: 1. 文本相关性保持学习：保持基础模型编码的文本查询间语义关系；2. 跨分支视频对齐：对比对齐方法，在不同时间尺度上解耦层次化视频表示；3. 顺序保持令牌合并和自适应CBVA：生成内部一致且相互区分的视频片段以增强对齐。

Result: 在PRVR基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该框架有效防止了语义坍缩，并显著提高了检索精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过解决文本和视频嵌入空间中的语义坍缩问题，在部分相关视频检索任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the
content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video
pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic
variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,
embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for
distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of
semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven
apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse
events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic
collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text
Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships
encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in
video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive
alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across
temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and
adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are
internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic
collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

Abstract: The ODELIA Breast MRI Challenge 2025 addresses a critical issue in breast
cancer screening: improving early detection through more efficient and accurate
interpretation of breast MRI scans. Even though methods for general-purpose
whole-body lesion segmentation as well as multi-time-point analysis exist,

reasoning and evidence that informed the design choices behind our final
submission, with a focus on performance, robustness, and clinical relevance. We

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了原则性ViT重新设计在低资源医学成像环境中开发高效可解释模型的潜力。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical
imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on
small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In
this paper, we present CoMViT, a compact and generalizable Vision Transformer
architecture optimized for resource-constrained medical image analysis. CoMViT
integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature
scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and
generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves
robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a
lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper
CNN and ViT variants, offering up to 5-20x parameter reduction without
sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative Grad-CAM analyses show that CoMViT
consistently attends to clinically relevant regions despite its compact size.
These results highlight the potential of principled ViT redesign for developing
efficient and interpretable models in low-resource medical imaging settings.

Conclusion: CIELR方法能有效处理复杂图像编辑任务，在保持一致性区域方面表现优异，且无需昂贵的联合微调。

Abstract: Existing image editing methods can handle simple editing instructions very
well. To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly
fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which
involves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this
issue, we propose a new method, called \textbf{C}omplex \textbf{I}mage
\textbf{E}diting via \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a
complex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions,
eliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and
diffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic
representation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce
an iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this
representation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image
scene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks.
Extensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our
method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating
its superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the
limited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with
reasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image
samples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing.
CIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark. The code and dataset

TL;DR: RzenEmbed是一个统一的多模态嵌入框架，支持文本、图像、视频和视觉文档，通过两阶段训练策略和优化的InfoNCE损失函数，在MMEB基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP框架主要关注自然图像，对其他重要视觉模态（如视频和视觉文档）的支持有限，需要开发一个统一的嵌入框架来覆盖多种视觉模态。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段专注于基础文本和多模态检索；第二阶段引入改进的InfoNCE损失，包含难度加权机制和假阴性缓解策略，同时使用可学习温度参数和模型融合技术。

Conclusion: RzenEmbed通过统一的框架和优化的训练策略，成功解决了多模态嵌入中多种视觉模态的表示学习问题，为多模态检索任务提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for
retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images,
offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and
visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified
framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including
text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage
training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage
focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we
introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements.
Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize
challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch.
Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives
and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's
discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities.
We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model
souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not
only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the
challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频检索方法存在结构性偏差，狭窄的基准激励有限的数据和单任务训练，抑制了通用能力的发展。缺乏能够定义和需求多维度泛化的诊断性评估。

Method: 1) 建立UVRB基准，包含16个数据集用于诊断能力差距；2) 基于UVRB诊断的可扩展合成工作流，生成155万高质量数据对；3) 模态金字塔课程，通过利用多样化数据中的潜在互连来训练通用视频嵌入器(GVE)。

Result: GVE在UVRB上实现了最先进的零样本泛化性能。分析显示流行基准对通用能力的预测能力较差，部分相关检索是一个主导但被忽视的场景。

Conclusion: 协同设计框架为摆脱有限范围、推进真正通用视频检索提供了实用路径。

Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow
benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.
Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a
diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional
generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the
co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal
Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to
measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks
and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable
synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate
the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality
Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by
explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.
Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular
benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant
retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed
framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance
toward truly universal video retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Feedforward-based Parameter Selection (FPS)，一种无需梯度的参数选择方法，在单次前向传播中识别最优参数子集，显著降低内存使用并加速参数选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法存在局限性：基于加法的方法（如Adapters）引入推理延迟和工程复杂性，而基于选择的方法（如GPS）需要完整反向传播，内存使用与完全微调相同。

Method: FPS通过参数幅度与对应输入激活的乘积来对参数进行排序，利用预训练知识和下游数据，在单次前向传播中完成参数选择。

Result: 在24个视觉任务上的评估显示，FPS达到与最先进方法相当的性能，同时将峰值内存使用减少近9倍，参数选择速度提升约2倍。

Conclusion: FPS为大规模预训练模型的微调提供了真正内存高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for
adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing
approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters
[1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while
selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2]
require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as
full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based
Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal
parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product
of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both
pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from
FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating
parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Spatial-SSRL，一种自监督强化学习范式，直接从普通RGB或RGB-D图像中获取可验证信号，通过五个预文本任务提升大视觉语言模型的空间理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型在空间理解方面存在弱点，而现有的监督微调和强化学习方法依赖昂贵的监督、专用工具或受限环境，限制了规模化应用。

Method: 自动制定五个预文本任务来捕捉2D和3D空间结构：打乱补丁重排序、翻转补丁识别、裁剪补丁修复、区域深度排序和相对3D位置预测，这些任务提供易于验证的答案且无需人工标注。

Result: 在七个空间理解基准测试中，Spatial-SSRL在图像和视频设置下分别实现了3B模型4.63%和7B模型3.89%的平均准确率提升。

Conclusion: 简单的内在监督能够实现规模化强化学习，为大视觉语言模型提供增强空间智能的实用途径。

Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision,
specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce
Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals
directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically
formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure:
shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting,
regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks
provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or
LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning
while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding
benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average
accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our
results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and
provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

Motivation: 现有布局生成方法需要复杂的用户约束规范，降低了可用性。用户草图作为直观的约束形式，目前在这一领域尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用多模态transformer架构，以草图和内容资产作为输入生成布局。为了解决训练数据稀缺问题，开发了高效的合成草图生成方法。

Conclusion: 草图到布局是一个有前景的研究方向，该方法通过直观的草图约束实现了高质量的布局生成，并发布了约20万合成草图数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating
aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While
recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the
layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which
reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided
sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the
effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout
problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.
To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal
transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to
produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human
annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and
efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train
and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet,
DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art
constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In
order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k)
synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets
are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/sketch_to_layout.

Motivation: 现有方法从文本中提取层次特征，但图像仅用单一特征表示，导致不对称和次优的对齐效果。

Method: 构建语义感知的视觉特征提取框架，使用交叉注意力机制从中间Transformer层提取视觉特征；将特征树嵌入具有不同曲率的双曲流形；通过最小化异构流形间的KL距离来学习中间流形进行对齐。

Result: 在多个图像数据集上的分类任务中，该方法在少样本和跨域设置下始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 证明了最优中间流形的存在性和唯一性，提出的跨树对齐方法有效解决了多模态层次特征的不对称对齐问题。

Abstract: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to
effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods
extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a
single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address
this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns
tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.
Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework
that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from
intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual
features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the
two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to
effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the
heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL
distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an
intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold.
Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines
under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VessShape方法，通过生成大规模2D合成血管数据集来增强分割模型的形状偏置，提高在真实血管分割任务中的少样本和零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决血管语义分割中标注数据稀缺和模型跨模态泛化能力差的问题，特别是CNN倾向于学习纹理特征而非形状特征的限制。

Method: 开发VessShape方法生成包含程序化管状几何结构和大范围前景背景纹理的合成数据集，强制模型学习形状线索。

Result: 在VessShape上预训练的模型在两个真实血管数据集上仅需4-10个样本微调即可达到强分割性能，并展现出显著的零样本能力。

Conclusion: 通过强形状偏置预训练是克服数据稀缺和提升血管分割模型泛化能力的有效策略。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

Conclusion: 综合自动和人工评估表明，PETAR显著提升了PET/CT报告生成质量，推动了3D医学视觉语言理解的发展

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D
imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and
computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,
small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a
large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired
with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid
rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset,
we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET,
CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges
global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing
clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human
evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report
generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.

TL;DR: DeblurSDI是一种零样本、自监督的盲图像去模糊框架，基于自扩散过程，无需预训练即可从噪声开始迭代恢复清晰图像和模糊核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统盲图像去模糊方法依赖手工先验，而深度学习方法需要大量外部数据集预训练，限制了在实际场景中的适应性。

Method: 将盲去模糊建模为迭代反向自扩散过程，使用两个随机初始化神经网络持续优化清晰图像和模糊核，结合数据一致性和L1稀疏约束，采用噪声调度机制稳定优化。

Result: 在广泛实验中，DeblurSDI始终表现出优越性能，即使在高度退化场景下也能恢复清晰图像和准确模糊核。

Conclusion: DeblurSDI通过自扩散框架实现了无需预训练的盲图像去模糊，具有出色的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Blind image deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, where
both the latent sharp image and the blur kernel are unknown. Traditional
methods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches
typically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting
their adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI,
a zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that
requires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an
iterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and
progressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized
neural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the
blur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data
consistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation
is our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and
provides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow
DeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input
image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves
superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in
highly degraded scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学插图生成方法存在两个主要问题：图像生成模型输出缺乏语义结构的栅格图像，无法编辑独立视觉组件；基于代码的方法虽然提供元素级控制，但编写-编译-审查循环繁琐且不够直观。两者都无法满足科学创作对效率、直观性和迭代修改的需求。

Method: VisPainter采用多智能体框架，包含三个专门模块：管理者、设计者和工具箱，基于模型上下文协议协同工作，生成与标准矢量图形软件兼容的图表。模块化、基于角色的设计使每个元素都能明确表示和操作。

Result: 开发了VisBench基准测试，包含七维评估指标，从内容、布局、视觉感知和交互成本四个方面评估高信息密度科学插图。通过消融实验验证了架构合理性和评估方法可靠性，并对各种视觉语言模型进行了评估。

Conclusion: VisPainter成功弥合了现有方法的差距，提供了真正的元素级控制，使任何元素都能在后期添加和修改，满足了科学插图创作对效率、直观性和迭代修改的需求。

Abstract: Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and
post-editability. However, current generative models have two major
limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking
semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange
independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation
methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users
into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the
intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet
the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in
scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent
framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.
VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a
Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector
graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be
explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and
any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the
quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with
seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density
scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,
and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments
to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our
evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,
presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of
their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the
impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of
illustrations.

Result: 初步评估表明该策略为教育基础设施地图绘制提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 多层级人机交互框架能够有效支持教育规划和资源分配，中分辨率方法因改进不显著而被移除。

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for
interactive school mapping designed to improve the accuracy and completeness of
educational facility records, particularly in developing regions where such
data may be scarce and infrequently updated. The first tier involves a machine
learning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing
infrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies
potential gaps and "mislabelled" schools. In subsequent tiers,
medium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint
regions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application
of very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate
detailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The
medium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.
The medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to
improve generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an
interactive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,
and refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the
multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for
educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.

Conclusion: 实验结果强调了跨模态身份验证对未来深度伪造检测的重要性。

Abstract: Since deepfakes generated by advanced generative models have rapidly posed
serious threats, existing audiovisual deepfake detection approaches struggle to
generalize to unseen forgeries. We propose a novel reference-aware audiovisual
deepfake detection method, called Referee. Speaker-specific cues from only
one-shot examples are leveraged to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal
artifacts. By matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and
target content into cross-modal features, Referee jointly reasons about
audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency. Extensive experiments on
FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF demonstrate that Referee achieves
state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation
protocols. Experimental results highlight the importance of cross-modal
identity verification for future deepfake detection. The code is available at

Conclusion: NAUTILUS通过VFE模块和数据集的构建，为水下场景理解提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了模型在水下环境中的性能表现。

Abstract: Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts
increasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration,
national security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods,
which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene
understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities.
However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning
datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we
construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting
eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and
thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater
image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with
underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,
we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose
a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly
restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned
baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.
Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the
performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring
the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area. Data

Motivation: 多模态推理需要语言和视觉之间的迭代协调，但目前尚不清楚什么构成了有意义的交错思维链。作者认为文本和图像思维应该作为互补而非同构的模态来共同推进推理。

Method: 构建ThinkMorph统一模型，在24K高质量交错推理轨迹上进行微调，涵盖不同视觉参与度的任务。模型学习生成渐进式的文本-图像推理步骤，具体操作视觉内容同时保持连贯的言语逻辑。

Result: 在视觉中心基准测试中平均提升34.7%，能够泛化到领域外任务，匹配或超越更大和专有的视觉语言模型。模型展现出新兴的多模态智能，包括未见过的视觉操作技能、自适应推理模式切换以及通过多样化多模态思维实现更好的测试时扩展。

Conclusion: 这些发现为表征统一多模态推理模型的新兴能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and
vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain
of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as
complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance
reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model
fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with
varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image
reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining
coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks
(averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks,
matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance,
ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual
manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better
test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts.These findings
suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of
unified models for multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法在严重失真条件下仍能实现优异的水印恢复能力，为3D点云版权保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid
growth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images
or videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,
as they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric
attacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In
this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural
watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership
verification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of
3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning
using PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to
reliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such
as rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our
method using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep
learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based
techniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly
outperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise
accuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD
achieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,
which is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This
demonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and
maintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.

Motivation: 历史地图是记录地理特征的重要档案，但由于风格多样性和标注数据稀缺，其自动分析面临挑战。构建时空关联数据集对研究建筑年代、道路网络发展和环境变化等应用至关重要。

Method: 将历史地图图像和时间序列视为视频处理：对于单张图像，将图块作为视频帧处理，利用记忆注意力机制整合上下文信息；对于时间序列，提出从单年地图生成伪时间序列的方法来减少标注成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，MapSAM2能有效学习时间关联，在有限监督或使用伪视频的情况下，能够准确分割和关联时间序列中的建筑物。

Conclusion: MapSAM2框架在历史地图分析中表现出色，能够处理多样化的分割任务，并通过发布数据集和代码支持未来研究。

Abstract: Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic
features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of
historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide
stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing
linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more
time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information
from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating
buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying
environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for
automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a
visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with
few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images
and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,
enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from
similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal
features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time
Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time
series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.
Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively
and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited
supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code
to support future research.

TL;DR: CroVCA提出了一种简单统一的二进制编码学习原则，通过交叉视图代码对齐和编码率最大化实现高效大规模检索，在5个训练周期内达到最先进效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模检索中高维嵌入空间计算成本高的问题，现有哈希方法存在复杂流程、多目标优化、训练时间长等缺点。

Method: 使用交叉视图代码对齐原则，单一二元交叉熵损失强制对齐，编码率最大化作为防崩溃正则化器，设计轻量级HashCoder网络。

Result: 在16位编码下表现优异，COCO无监督哈希在2分钟内完成，ImageNet100监督哈希约3分钟完成，单GPU实现。

Conclusion: CroVCA展示了高效性、适应性和广泛适用性，为大规模检索提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both
compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and
multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional
spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by
enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing
approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs
specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We
introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle
for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned
views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate
maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and
diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP
hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced
codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt
encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves
state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly
well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes
and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These
results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了ANCHOR框架，通过监督对比学习和硬正样本挖掘，使模型学习对抗性鲁棒的特征表示，在CIFAR-10上实现了优异的干净和鲁棒准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络虽然强大，但其依赖的梯度学习机制存在脆弱性，容易被对抗性攻击利用，导致模型做出错误预测。

Method: 使用监督对比学习结合显式硬正样本挖掘，让图像、其增强版本和扰动版本的嵌入在嵌入空间中聚集，同时与其他类别分离。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，ANCHOR在PGD-20攻击下取得了优异的干净和鲁棒准确率，优于标准对抗训练方法。

Conclusion: 结合对抗性指导和硬挖掘对比监督有助于模型学习更结构化、鲁棒的特征表示，缩小准确率和鲁棒性之间的差距。

Abstract: Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their
core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by
step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This
process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw.
The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small,
imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision.
Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this
vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while
leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong
predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive
Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the
power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to
enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings
for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster
together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same
class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps
the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient
cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and
robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard
adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial
guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more
structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and
robustness.

Motivation: 生成扩散模型创建的合成图像越来越难以与真实图像区分，引发了真实性、版权和错误信息担忧。现有监督检测器在跨未见生成器泛化方面表现不佳，需要大量标注数据和频繁重新训练。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型的内部激活特征，使用k近邻分类器进行深度伪造检测，同时构建紧凑神经网络模型进行生成器溯源。

Result: 在跨生成器检测中达到最先进性能，无需微调即可准确识别合成图像并溯源生成器。

Conclusion: 扩散表示固有地编码了生成器特定模式，为合成图像取证提供了简单且可解释的基础。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative diffusion models has enabled the creation of
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones,
raising concerns about authenticity, copyright, and misinformation. Existing
supervised detectors often struggle to generalize across unseen generators,
requiring extensive labeled data and frequent retraining. We introduce FRIDA
(Fake-image Recognition and source Identification via Diffusion-features
Analysis), a lightweight framework that leverages internal activations from a
pre-trained diffusion model for deepfake detection and source generator
attribution. A k-nearest-neighbor classifier applied to diffusion features
achieves state-of-the-art cross-generator performance without fine-tuning,
while a compact neural model enables accurate source attribution. These results
show that diffusion representations inherently encode generator-specific
patterns, providing a simple and interpretable foundation for synthetic image
forensics.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型在联合预测下一状态观察和动作序列时面临模态差异的挑战，需要解决多模态冲突问题。

Method: 提出多模态扩散transformer架构，维护分离的模态流但允许跨模态知识共享；引入独立噪声扰动和解耦流匹配损失；采用支持测试时缩放的联合采样方法。

Result: 在RoboCasa和GR-1模拟基准上比基线方法提升6%；测试时缩放额外提升2-5%；在Franka Research 3真实任务中成功率提升13%；在BridgeV2动作无关视频预训练后在RoboCasa上获得显著迁移增益。

Conclusion: DUST通过解耦多模态训练和异步采样有效解决了VLA中的模态冲突问题，展示了在大规模VLA预训练中的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling
has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains
challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences
because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,
we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework
that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across
diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer
architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still
enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent
noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This
design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional
manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the
decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling
method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve
asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks
such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,
while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On
real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by
13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training
on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on
RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

Method: 引入协商器从各模态代理的本地表示中推导公共表示，使用发送器和接收器对实现特征空间转换，并通过结构对齐损失、语用对齐损失和分布对齐损失来监督训练。

Result: NegoCollab有效减少了与各种本地表示之间的固有领域差距，使公共表示中的知识能够充分提炼到发送器中。

Conclusion: 基于协商公共表示的异构协作方法能够有效解决异构协作感知中的领域差距问题，提高协作性能。

Abstract: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the
perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable
heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as
participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This
leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,
consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all
agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training
cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as
the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with
significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper
alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method
based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator
during training to derive the common representation from the local
representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent
domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual
transformation of features between the local representation space and the
common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To
better align local representations to the common representation containing
multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic
alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the
training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully
distilled into the sender.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IoU度量对小目标检测敏感，Wasserstein距离缺乏尺度不变性且优化效率低，需要一种更好的相似性度量方法。

Method: 引入高斯组合距离(GCD)，通过分析其梯度和特性，证明其具有尺度不变性并支持联合优化，作为边界框回归损失函数和标签分配度量。

Result: 在AI-TOD-v2小目标检测数据集上实现SOTA性能，在MS-COCO-2017和Visdrone-2019数据集上验证了GCD的泛化能力，优于Wasserstein距离。

Conclusion: GCD作为相似性度量方法，解决了现有方法的局限性，在小目标检测中表现出优越性能，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly
enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the
most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a
similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of
their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent
studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for
measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we
have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which
negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when
used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes
leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).
Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD
not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,
which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the
AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box
regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability
of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the
Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无监督深度学习的通用去噪框架，用于提升定量显微镜工作流程的质量，该框架能够保持物理保真度、减少不确定性，并在多种成像模态中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 操作显微镜在观测功能材料的动态化学物理过程时，测量噪声限制了有效分辨率并影响定量分析的准确性。

Method: 开发了无监督深度学习去噪框架，结合偏微分方程约束优化进行模型学习，并在扫描透射X射线显微镜、光学显微镜和中子射线成像等多种模态上应用验证。

Result: 去噪后揭示了磷酸铁锂的纳米尺度化学和结构异质性，实现了石墨电极中颗粒分割和相分类的自动化，并将中子射线成像中的噪声诱导变异性降低了近80%，从而解析了锂的异质传输。

Conclusion: 深度去噪作为一种强大的、模态无关的增强技术，推动了定量操作成像的发展，并扩展了先前受噪声限制技术的应用范围。

Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and
physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise
limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we
present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based
denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length
scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves
physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model
learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization.
Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural
heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron
phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase
classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces
noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve
heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep
denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances
quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited
techniques.

Motivation: 现有行人重识别方法在遮挡、视角变形和图像质量差的情况下表现不佳，通常依赖复杂模块或仅在清晰正面图像上有效。

Method: 基于ViT-Base构建，包含三个关键组件：1）最终Transformer层的Shuffle模块打破空间相关性；2）场景适应增强模拟监控条件；3）DeiT知识蒸馏提高有限标签下的学习能力。

Result: 在自建MyTT数据集上达到83.2% Rank-1和80.1% mAP，在Market1501上达到94.6% Rank-1和87.5% mAP，优于CNN和ViT基线及最先进方法。

Conclusion: Sh-ViT无需外部模块即可提高对遮挡和模糊的鲁棒性，为基于监控的人员监控提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) in surveillance is challenged by occlusion,
viewpoint distortion, and poor image quality. Most existing methods rely on
complex modules or perform well only on clear frontal images. We propose Sh-ViT
(Shuffling Vision Transformer), a lightweight and robust model for occluded
person ReID. Built on ViT-Base, Sh-ViT introduces three components: First, a
Shuffle module in the final Transformer layer to break spatial correlations and
enhance robustness to occlusion and blur; Second, scenario-adapted augmentation
(geometric transforms, erasing, blur, and color adjustment) to simulate
surveillance conditions; Third, DeiT-based knowledge distillation to improve
learning with limited labels.To support real-world evaluation, we construct the
MyTT dataset, containing over 10,000 pedestrians and 30,000+ images from base
station inspections, with frequent equipment occlusion and camera variations.
Experiments show that Sh-ViT achieves 83.2% Rank-1 and 80.1% mAP on MyTT,
outperforming CNN and ViT baselines, and 94.6% Rank-1 and 87.5% mAP on
Market1501, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.In summary, Sh-ViT improves
robustness to occlusion and blur without external modules, offering a practical

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Phased DMD多步蒸馏框架，通过渐进分布匹配和子区间分数匹配，在保持生成多样性的同时提升模型容量，解决了传统DMD在复杂生成任务中的性能限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DMD方法在复杂生成任务（如文本到视频生成）中性能有限，而直接扩展为多步蒸馏会导致内存使用增加、计算深度加深，造成不稳定和效率降低。随机梯度截断虽然被提出作为解决方案，但会显著降低多步蒸馏模型的生成多样性。

Method: Phased DMD结合了分阶段蒸馏和专家混合（MoE）的思想，包含两个关键设计：1）渐进分布匹配：将SNR范围划分为子区间，逐步将模型细化到更高SNR水平；2）子区间分数匹配：通过严格的数学推导确保每个子区间内的训练目标准确性。

Result: 在包括Qwen-Image（200亿参数）和Wan2.2（280亿参数）在内的最先进图像和视频生成模型上进行验证，实验结果表明Phased DMD在保留关键生成能力的同时，比DMD更好地保持了输出多样性。

Conclusion: Phased DMD通过分阶段蒸馏框架有效解决了多步蒸馏中的多样性和稳定性问题，为复杂生成任务的模型蒸馏提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative
models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one
correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However,
limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex
generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video
generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory
usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.
While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential
solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of
multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step
counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step
distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model
capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution
matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the
SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR
levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training
objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous
mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art
image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and
Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD
preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative
capabilities. We will release our code and models.

Conclusion: LifWavNet为基于雷达的非接触式ECG测量建立了一个稳健的框架，在重建质量和可解释性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) reconstruction from radar signals offers
a promising approach for unobtrusive cardiac monitoring. We present LifWavNet,
a lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis
(MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use
fixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with
lifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features
and synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve
reconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in
both temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets
demonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG
reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate
variability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the
interpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in
radar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust

Conclusion: CATArena为快速发展的智能体能力提供了持续动态的评估方法，强调了学习能力在智能体进化中的核心作用。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to
autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools.
However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed
scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score
saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities
improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability,
including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent
evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive
peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their
strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically
evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue
in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation
platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring.
By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables
continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities.
Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code
agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable
benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and
strategy coding.

Conclusion: 这种基于可验证LCoT知识库的推理中心方法能够实现可信赖的跨领域科学合成，并为不断扩展的百科全书奠定基础。

Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while
omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders
verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits
cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical
and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that
decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long
Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent
encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven,
reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200
courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To
ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which
are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer
consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus
powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search --
retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target
concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates
these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia
comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations
across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved
LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly
lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval
(as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base,
this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific
synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding
encyclopedia.

Abstract: We present Denario, an AI multi-agent system designed to serve as a
scientific research assistant. Denario can perform many different tasks, such
as generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans,
writing and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a
scientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle
specific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end
scientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we
describe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by
presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different
scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical
informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine,
neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from
different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies
methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We
report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who
provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the
strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we
discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such
technology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code
at https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario. A Denario demo can also be run
directly on the web at https://huggingface.co/spaces/astropilot-ai/Denario, and
the full app will be deployed on the cloud.

Motivation: 基础模型在物理信息系统中增强了感知、推理和规划能力，但也带来了幻觉、过度泛化和上下文错位等新型错误，导致错误决策。

Method: 引入认知包络概念，建立推理边界来约束AI生成的决策，同时补充元认知和传统安全包络的使用。

Conclusion: 认知包络是解决基础模型在物理信息系统中决策错误的重要方法，需要建立系统的定义和验证流程。

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on Foundational Models such as Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to increase autonomy
through enhanced perception, inference, and planning. However, these models
also introduce new types of errors, such as hallucinations,
overgeneralizations, and context misalignments, resulting in incorrect and
flawed decisions. To address this, we introduce the concept of Cognition
Envelopes, designed to establish reasoning boundaries that constrain
AI-generated decisions while complementing the use of meta-cognition and
traditional safety envelopes. As with safety envelopes, Cognition Envelopes
require practical guidelines and systematic processes for their definition,
validation, and assurance.

*Jared Junkin,Samuel Nathanson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明，在非序列数据（如国际象棋棋盘状态）上应用因果掩码训练的语言模型，比在序列化数据上训练的模型表现更好，挑战了传统认为因果掩码只适用于序列数据的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在具有空间或关系结构的数据上使用因果掩码的可行性，传统上认为因果掩码不适用于此类数据，而是采用序列化处理。

Method: 在国际象棋领域训练具有双向和因果自注意力机制的语言模型，分别使用空间（棋盘状态）和序列（走棋顺序）两种数据表示。

Result: 在空间棋盘状态上训练的模型（即使使用因果掩码）始终比在序列数据上训练的模型具有更强的下棋能力。

Conclusion: 在空间数据上应用因果掩码是训练单模态LLM的可行方法，在某些领域甚至优于序列化处理。

Abstract: Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains
with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as
inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question
of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal
masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because
few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same
dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which
naturally supports both representations. We train language models with
bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial
(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models
trained on spatial board states - \textit{even with causal masking} -
consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on
sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are
methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to
spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data,
and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.

*Michael Kleinman,Matthew Trager,Alessandro Achille,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了自适应努力控制方法，通过强化学习训练模型使用用户指定的相对思考量，实现动态调整成本-准确率权衡，可在保持性能的同时减少约3倍的思维链长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型增加思考预算能提高准确性，但不同问题需要不同的推理量。用户需要在输出质量、延迟和成本之间权衡，但现有方法缺乏细粒度控制，且需要预先知道问题难度来设置token预算。

Method: 自适应努力控制：基于强化学习的自适应方法，训练模型使用用户指定的相对于当前平均思维链长度的token比例，无需数据集和阶段特定调优。

Result: 在1.5B到32B参数规模的模型上，该方法能在保持或改进性能的同时，将思维链长度减少约3倍，产生更好的成本-准确率权衡曲线。

Conclusion: 该方法通过连续努力参数实现动态成本-准确率权衡，模型能自动按任务难度比例分配资源，为AI推理提供灵活的控制机制。

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve
accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may
prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they
value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff
effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used
for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing
methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but
this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately
set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains
models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current
average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates
dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy
tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the
cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at
inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate
resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales
ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x
reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance
relative to the base model used for RL training.

Conclusion: 人机回环反馈在数据飞轮框架下能够将企业AI代理转变为自改进系统，提供了构建能够在实际使用中大规模学习的稳健自适应企业AI代理的可重复蓝图。

Abstract: Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce
latency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical
implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a
MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically
addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and
enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we
monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two
major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors
(3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements
through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a
fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,
and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\%
gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how
human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,
transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings
include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback,
navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production.
This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive
enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了SOTA LLMs在数学证明评分方面的能力，发现模型能可靠识别错误证明但存在部分分数校准问题，为此提出了基于智能体工作流程的多步骤评分方法，显著提高了与人工评分的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在解决奥林匹克数学问题方面取得显著进展，需要评估这些模型在证明评分方面的能力，包括错误检测、严重性判断和分数分配，而不仅仅是二元正确性判断。

Method: 使用90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的解决方案和MathArena的IMO/USAMO 2025解决方案集，引入智能体工作流程来提取和分析参考解决方案，自动推导问题特定的评分标准，并进行多步骤评分过程。

Result: 模型能可靠标记错误（包括细微错误）解决方案，但在部分分数分配上存在校准差距。提出的工作流程在注释语料库和MathArena上实现了与人工评分更高的一致性，并在各项指标上更一致地处理部分分数。

Conclusion: 智能体工作流程能有效改进LLMs的证明评分能力，特别是在部分分数分配的一致性方面，为未来研究提供了代码、数据和提示/日志资源。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: 通过将推理LLM与结构化实验相结合，AI能够为复杂系统问题生成创造性且可理解的设计。

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the
creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture
for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a
human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning,
experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework
that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior
ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates
interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a
distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for
request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert
levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload
behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured
experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for
complex systems problems.

Motivation: 传统线性生命周期模型在当今网络化系统环境中已显不足，需要解决跨学科互操作性、变体管理、可追溯性和跨组织治理等关键挑战。

Method: 基于文献综述和行业经验，提出以MBSE为语义骨干、PLM为治理配置层、CAD-CAE为模型衍生领域的参考框架，并定义四项原则和三步实施路线图。

Result: 实施该框架可提高变更鲁棒性、缩短交付周期、改善重用率，并为可持续性决策提供依据。

Conclusion: 该框架帮助决策者和从业者管理复杂性，设计可扩展的SoS价值流，实现从产品中心到网络中心的开发转型。

Abstract: Today, products are no longer isolated artifacts, but nodes in networked
systems. This means that traditional, linearly conceived life cycle models are
reaching their limits: Interoperability across disciplines, variant and
configuration management, traceability, and governance across organizational
boundaries are becoming key factors. This collective contribution classifies
the state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS
lifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic
backbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and
configuration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and
digital twin as continuous feedback. Based on current literature and industry
experience, mobility, healthcare, and the public sector, we identify four
principles: (1) referenced architecture and data models, (2) end-to-end
configuration sovereignty instead of tool silos, (3) curated models with clear
review gates, and (4) measurable value contributions along time, quality, cost,
and sustainability. A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to
network- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling
across variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,
training, compliance). The results are increased change robustness, shorter
throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions. This
article is aimed at decision-makers and practitioners who want to make
complexity manageable and design SoS value streams to be scalable.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展增强了对个性化技术的需求，但现有参数化适配方法在处理动态用户模式和高数据稀疏场景时存在适应性和数据效率不足的问题。

Method: 采用细粒度引导组件从注意力层和MLP层捕获激活信号，结合输入感知聚合模块将这些信号合成为上下文相关的增强，动态生成样本级干扰向量注入模型前向传播。

Result: 在多样化场景（包括短文本到长文本生成、网页函数调用）的广泛实验中验证了方法的有效性和兼容性，显著提升了在快速变化环境中的个性化性能，同时在不同交互模式和上下文长度下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法具有高灵活性和数据效率，与现有方法正交，可作为插件组件与不同个性化技术兼容，在快速变化分布和高数据稀疏场景中表现优异。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
demand for effective personalization techniques that can adapt model behavior
to individual user preferences. Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing
the in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods,
including personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling
emerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user
patterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and
instance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level
interference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward
pass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical
innovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by
hooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware
aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant
enhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency,
excelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In
addition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as
a plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text
generation, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and
compatibility of our approach. Results show that our method significantly
enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while
maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation
agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and
effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that
systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history
summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent
Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning,
which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries
for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent,
\textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled
trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware
objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance.
Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
results under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong
performance in out-of-domain scenarios. These findings validate our framework's
ability to maintain robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI
navigation tasks. Code is available at https://leon022.github.io/GUI-Rise.

Motivation: 传统奖励机在处理长时程问题中无序子任务时，学习信息量会随子任务数量呈指数级增长，限制了其可扩展性。

Method: 提出了三种RM泛化形式：数值RM（紧凑表达复杂任务）、议程RM（跟踪剩余子任务）、耦合RM（子任务状态耦合），并开发了CoRM组合学习算法。

Result: 实验表明CoRM在具有无序子任务的长时程问题上，比现有最先进的RM算法具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过引入新的RM泛化形式和组合学习算法，有效解决了长时程无序子任务学习中的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) inform reinforcement learning agents about the reward
structure of the environment. This is particularly advantageous for complex
non-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more
efficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for
long-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order.
In such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with
the number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by
introducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to
express complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are
associated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)
Coupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.
Furthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages
coupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM). Our experiments show that CoRM
scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems
with unordered subtasks.

Conclusion: 结果感知的过程发现方法能够揭示期望和不期望执行的关键驱动因素，为过程改进提供更有价值的见解。

Abstract: Event logs extracted from information systems offer a rich foundation for
understanding and improving business processes. In many real-world
applications, it is possible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable
process executions, where desirable traces reflect efficient or compliant
behavior, and undesirable ones may involve inefficiencies, rule violations,
delays, or resource waste. This distinction presents an opportunity to guide
process discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process
model without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for
conformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical
behavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may
obscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By
learning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we
group traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery
separately within each group. This results in focused and interpretable models
that reveal the drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions. The
approach is implemented as a publicly available tool and it is evaluated on
multiple real-life event logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in isolating and
visualizing critical process patterns.

Conclusion: LLMs对此问题的贡献基于错误假设，强调需要严格验证和情境化评估LLM生成输出的科学价值。

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide
interesting ideas contributing to mathematical discovery. This claim was
motivated by reports that LLM-based genetic algorithms produced heuristics
offering new insights into the online bin packing problem under uniform and
Weibull distributions. In this work, we reassess this claim through a detailed
analysis of the heuristics produced by LLMs, examining both their behavior and
interpretability. Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely
opaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new
class of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The
derived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more
interpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances
are themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim
regarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the
mistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied. Our
findings instead emphasize the need for rigorous validation and
contextualization when assessing the scientific value of LLM-generated outputs.

Result: 在四个VQA基准测试（VQA 2.0、ScienceQA、MAT-Search和MathVista）上评估，展示了强大的泛化能力，在所有数据集上平均性能提升高达+6.69%。

Conclusion: ToolScope框架通过统一全局规划和局部多模态感知，有效解决了MLLM在长视野VQA任务中视觉上下文退化的问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools
for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse
nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning
remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an
agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal
perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context
degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary
components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response
Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering
high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to
augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external
tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer
consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly
output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains,
including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up
to +6.69% across all datasets.

Conclusion: 带有人类约束的多智能体强化学习是模拟真实道路用户交互的有前景方法，能够在小数据集下有效工作并考虑个体差异。

Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human
road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing
approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or
'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack
flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor
constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in
interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of
pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised
pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,
two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across
behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined
model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints
lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during
crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual
uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more
cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this
data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning
model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training
datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by
modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level
distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on
pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that
multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for
simulating realistic road user interactions.

Motivation: 解决人机协作中的"意图表达鸿沟"问题，即用户难以有效向AI传达复杂高维想法，导致低效的试错循环，特别是针对不同专业水平的用户。

Method: 基于信息论原理的训练框架，将对话中的信息增益定义为内在奖励信号，等同于结构化任务空间中香农熵的减少，无需依赖人工偏好标注或外部奖励模型。

Result: 在科学图表生成任务中，Nous实现了领先的效率和输出质量，对不同专业水平的用户保持鲁棒性，且设计具有领域无关性，在图表生成之外也显示出泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决复杂人机协作中用户意图不确定性提供了一个原则性、可扩展和自适应的范式。

Abstract: A fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration is the "intention
expression gap," the difficulty for humans to effectively convey complex,
high-dimensional thoughts to AI. This challenge often traps users in
inefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise
levels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to
a Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for
information to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed
agent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core
mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of
information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from
dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to
the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward
design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or
external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated
simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the
challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,
including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across
user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to
varying user expertise. Moreover, its design is domain-agnostic, and we show
evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation. Experimental results
prove that our work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for
resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用监督微调或带令牌长度奖励的强化学习来提高效率，但往往以牺牲准确性为代价。

Method: 采用自适应长度奖励机制，实时基于模型能力动态分类问题为简单或困难，对简单问题鼓励短推理路径，对困难问题促进长探索性思维链。

Result: 在数学基准测试中，DeepCompress持续优于基线方法，在显著提高令牌效率的同时实现更优的准确性。

Conclusion: DeepCompress通过自适应调整思维链长度，能够同时提升大型推理模型的准确性和效率，证明了长响应在困难问题中的价值。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but
suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and
``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised
fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can
improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper
introduces \textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously
enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing
approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer
responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult
problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that
dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on
the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient
reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory
thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the
model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing
reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds
challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show
that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在数学几何推理方面面临高质量几何数据稀缺的挑战，现有合成方法生成的数据缺乏多样性且偏离真实几何图示。

Method: 使用形式化语言在度量空间中探索条件组合，通过符号引擎确保正确性，生成与原始问题不同的高保真几何问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用GeoFM合成数据训练的模型在MathVista几何问题解决任务上超越GPT-4o模型18.7%，在GeoQA上超越16.5%；在开源模型中分别领先5.7%和2.7%。

Conclusion: GeoFM方法能有效解决几何数据稀缺问题，生成的合成数据质量显著优于现有方法，大幅提升了多模态大语言模型的几何推理性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
in both academia and industry for their capabilities in handling multi-modal
tasks. However, these models face challenges in mathematical geometric
reasoning due to the scarcity of high-quality geometric data. To address this
issue, synthetic geometric data has become an essential strategy. Current
methods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding
existing problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create
geometric images and problems. However, these approaches often produce data
that lacks diversity or is prone to noise. Additionally, the geometric images
synthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate
significantly from authentic geometric diagrams. To overcome these limitations,
we propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses
formal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space,
generating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals
while ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show
that our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods. The model
trained with our data surpass the proprietary GPT-4o model by 18.7\% on
geometry problem-solving tasks in MathVista and by 16.5\% on GeoQA.
Additionally, it exceeds the performance of a leading open-source model by
5.7\% on MathVista and by 2.7\% on GeoQA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TempoBench是第一个正式基础且可验证的诊断基准，通过参数化难度来系统分析LLM的推理能力，包含时序轨迹评估和时序因果评估两个基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理改进方法存在局限性：临时生成的数据集可能编码偏见且无法正式验证，而Lean等证明系统虽然可验证但不适合捕捉基于决策链的任务特性，导致在业务代理或代码助手等功能上的性能差距。

Method: TempoBench使用两个评估基准：时序轨迹评估测试LLM理解和模拟多步推理系统执行的能力；时序因果评估测试LLM进行多步因果推理和从复杂系统中提取因果关系的能力。

Result: 模型在TCE-normal上得分65.6%，在TCE-hard上仅得7.5%，表明最先进的LLM能理解时序因果评估任务，但随着系统复杂性增加表现很差。

Conclusion: TempoBench填补了LLM推理基准的空白，提供了正式可验证的评估框架，揭示了当前LLM在复杂推理任务上的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human
performance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers
either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems
such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture
the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some
inadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be
formally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee
verifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic
decision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for
functions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of
LLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or
real-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and
verifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically
analyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks
to break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests
the ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given
multi-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)
tests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill
cause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score
65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art
LLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity
increases. Our code is available at our
\href{https://github.com/nik-hz/tempobench}{GitHub repository}.

TL;DR: SIGMA是一个多智能体检索增强框架，通过协调专门智能体进行独立推理、定向搜索和结果合成，在数学推理任务上显著优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强模型依赖单一视角、搜索策略不灵活、难以有效整合多源信息，限制了数学推理问题的解决能力。

Method: 引入SIGMA框架，通过协调专门智能体独立推理、执行定向搜索，并通过调节机制合成发现。每个智能体生成假设段落以优化其分析视角的检索。

Result: 在MATH500、AIME和GPQA等基准测试中，SIGMA持续优于开源和闭源系统，绝对性能提升7.4%。

Conclusion: 多智能体按需知识集成显著提高了推理准确性和效率，为复杂知识密集型问题解决提供了可扩展方法。

Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to
relevant knowledge but also careful, multi-step thinking. However, current
retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow
inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information
from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge
Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that
orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted
searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent
generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic
perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and
computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as
MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms
both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance
improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand
knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive
problem-solving. We will release the code upon publication.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在简化环境中仅评估狭窄技能，无法全面评估AI代理在科学研究中的端到端能力，因此需要更现实的评估平台。

Method: 开发InnovatorBench基准测试平台，包含20个任务覆盖数据构建、过滤、增强、损失设计、奖励设计和支架构建等领域；创建ResearchGym研究环境提供丰富的动作空间、分布式执行和异步监控；实现轻量级ReAct代理结合推理与可执行规划。

Conclusion: InnovatorBench具有足够的挑战性，能够成为下一代基于代码的研究基准测试，揭示了当前AI代理在科学研究自动化方面的局限性。

Abstract: AI agents could accelerate scientific discovery by automating hypothesis
formation, experiment design, coding, execution, and analysis, yet existing
benchmarks probe narrow skills in simplified settings. To address this gap, we
introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end
assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It
comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss
Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable
artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and
uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research
environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon
execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a
lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable
planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2.
Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in
code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks
and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management,
and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over
11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the
benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the
next generation of code-based research benchmark.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在硬件描述语言生成方面面临参数知识有限和领域特定约束的挑战，现有的多代理方法存在噪声传播和推理空间受限的问题。

Method: 提出VeriMoA框架：1）质量引导缓存机制，保存所有中间HDL输出并进行质量排序选择；2）多路径生成策略，利用C++和Python作为中间表示，将规范到HDL的翻译分解为两阶段过程。

Result: 在VerilogEval 2.0和RTLLM 2.0基准测试中，VeriMoA实现了15-30%的Pass@1改进，使较小模型能够匹配较大模型和微调替代方案，无需昂贵训练。

Conclusion: VeriMoA通过协同创新有效解决了当前多代理方法的局限性，为硬件设计自动化提供了高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Automation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design can help developers meet
increasing computational demands. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to
limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt
engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training
costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance
reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent
approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise
propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a
training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic
innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all
intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across
the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers
of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and
Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL
translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource
languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on
VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves
15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially
enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives
without requiring costly training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型驱动的具身智能体引入了新的安全风险：视觉后门攻击，其中智能体在视觉触发器出现时会持续执行攻击者指定的多步策略。

Method: BEAT通过(1)构建涵盖多样化场景、任务和触发器放置的训练集，以及(2)两阶段训练方案（监督微调+对比触发器学习）来应对触发器变化的挑战。

Result: 在各种具身智能体基准测试和多模态大语言模型中，BEAT攻击成功率高达80%，保持强健的正常任务性能，并能可靠地泛化到分布外触发器放置。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了基于多模态大语言模型的具身智能体中一个关键但未被探索的安全风险，强调了在现实世界部署前需要强大的防御措施。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by
enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from
visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack
surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a
visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an
attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to
inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in
the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit
wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant
reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that
spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger
variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning
(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between
trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision
boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent
benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while
maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to
out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL
boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.
These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based
embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world
deployment.

Motivation: 重新定义Agentic AI，强调其在企业环境中的实际应用价值，指出当前过度关注LLM而忽视应用验证的问题。

Method: 提出现实主义定义方法，将Agentic AI与SaaS类比，分析其在企业复杂环境中的自主工作特性，并讨论验证工具与技术的需求。

Result: 明确了Agentic AI作为应用而非基础模型的本质，提出了验证优先的理念，发现良好验证下可用更简单模型替代LLM。

Conclusion: Agentic AI的成功关键在于验证，而非基础模型的选择。LLM只是实现验证的选项之一，在适当验证下可用更优的替代方案。

Abstract: While AI agents have long been discussed and studied in computer science,
today's Agentic AI systems are something new. We consider other definitions of
Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software
delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an
application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven
excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are
primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on
validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques
needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite
different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models.
Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the
foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more
interpretable models that handle core logic. When it comes to Agentic AI,
validity is what you need. LLMs are one option that might achieve it.

Conclusion: 结果表明人类在环采样在长时域、领域专业化任务中的关键作用，以及Apollo设计的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in
domains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface
manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall
into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through
behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that
can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which
often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on
domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that
integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.
Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to
intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing
prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it
possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable
trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter
out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these
components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon
environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using
InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5
model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the
untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human
interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop
sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), which maps target proteins to candidate
molecular ligands, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Effectively
aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations, and
ensuring alignment between generated drugs and their pharmacological
properties, remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges, we
propose MolChord, which integrates two key techniques: (1) to align protein and
molecule structures with their textual descriptions and sequential
representations (e.g., FASTA for proteins and SMILES for molecules), we
leverage NatureLM, an autoregressive model unifying text, small molecules, and
proteins, as the molecule generator, alongside a diffusion-based structure
encoder; and (2) to guide molecules toward desired properties, we curate a
property-aware dataset by integrating preference data and refine the alignment
process using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on
CrossDocked2020 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on key evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential as a
practical tool for SBDD.
