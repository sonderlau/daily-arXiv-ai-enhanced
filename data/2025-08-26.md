Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于温度、压力和潜热加热率的垂直地面估算对流云垂直速度的方法，通过分析模型验证在温带和中纬度环境下的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对流云垂直速度的全球长期估算在太空观测中仍缺失，而该参数对对流云发育和全球湿度运输有重要影响。

Method: 基于稳态和非稳态管模型，推导出垂直速度与凝结速率之间的线性关系，并通过不同模型核心和分辨率的模拟进行验证。

Result: 在低至240K温度下，估算速度与模拟值偏差约为2m/s，在中纬度地区存在较高不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法为全球垂直速度估算提供了可行途径，将来可通过卫星观测进一步验证和改进。

Abstract: The vertical velocity in convective clouds ($w_c$) mediates convective anvil
development and global moisture transport, influencing Earth's energy budget,
but has yet to be estimated globally over long periods due to the absence of
spaceborne retrievals. Here, a method for estimating $w_c$ given vertical
profiles of in-cloud temperature, pressure, and latent heating rate is
presented and assessed. The method relies on analytical models for the
approximately linear relationship between $w_c$ and condensation rate
($\dot{q}_{vc}$) in convective clouds, which we derive from steady-state and
non-steady-state plume models. We include in our analysis a version of
$\dot{q}_{vc}/w_c$ derived from the supersaturation rate in convective clouds,
recently presented in Kukulies et al. (2024). We assess the accuracy of the
analytical models against convective cloud simulations run with different model
cores and spatial resolutions in both tropical and mid-latitude environments.
Differences in accuracies between tropical and mid-latitude environments
suggest that this approach for estimating $w_c$ may lead to higher
uncertainties in the mid-latitudes, although the estimated velocities are
accurate. Despite assumptions in the analytical expressions that theoretically
restrict them to liquid water clouds, $w_c$ is estimated to within $\approx2$
m/s of the simulated values at temperatures as low as 240 K. Potential
applications, validation against future satellite mission observables, and
future approaches for improving the estimation are discussed.

### [2] [Uncoupled high-latitude wave models in COAMPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16755)
*W. E. Rogers,T. J. Campbell,J. Yu,R. A. Allard*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 本报告展示了SWAN和WW3两种波浪模型在高纬度海冰区域的6个案例实验，重点验证波浪与海冰互作用的模拟效果和不同设置对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高纬度海域波浪与海冰相互作用的模拟问题，验证海冰对波浪能量消耗的新经验公式的效果，并评估不同模型设置对预测精度的影响。

Method: 采用COAMPS(R)耦合模型系统，运12小时周期运行SWAN和WW3波浪模型。进行4种非标准设置实验：禁用海冰消耗、使用旧公式、高分辨率风场和海冰活动强制、省略表面流。通过可视化检查和与卫星SWIM仪器、冰面运动传感器观测数据进行验证。

Result: 定量评估了各种设置对模型性能的影响，并与全球低分辨率波浪模型进行了性能对比。新的依赖冰崜度的海冰波浪能量消耗经验公式显示出更好的模拟效果。

Conclusion: 研究验证了高纬度海冰区域波浪模拟的可靠性，新的海冰消耗公式显著提升了模型性能，为海洋预测提供了重要技术支持。

Abstract: This report describes six demonstration cases of two numerical ocean wave
models in high latitude regions where waves interact with sea ice. The two wave
models are SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) and WW3 (WAVEWATCH III), run in
uncoupled mode within the Navy's coupled regional modeling system, COAMPS(R)
(Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System). The COAMPS software
handles a large majority of the tasks associated with the setup, running, and
post-processing of the wave models. All six cases are cycling runs with 12-hour
increments, each providing a continuous hindcast of four to 26 days duration.
SWAN is applied in a Bering Strait case and two Gulf of Bothnia cases. WW3 is
applied in a Sea of Okhotsk case and two Barents Sea cases. Verification is
performed by visual inspection of model output fields, and by comparing model
runs with alternative settings. In the standard configuration, forcing comes
from archived global model output, including information on surface wind
vectors, sea ice concentration and thickness, and surface current vectors, and
the wave model uses a new empirical formula for dissipation of wave energy by
sea ice that is dependent on ice thickness. The Barents Sea cases are compared
to spectral wave data from satellite (SWIM instrument on CFOSAT) and from
motion sensors deployed on the ice by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.
Experiments are performed with non-standard settings, 1) disabling the
dissipation by sea ice, 2) using an older formula for dissipation by sea ice
which does not depend on ice thickness, 3) using higher resolution wind and sea
ice concentration forcing fields, and 4) omitting surface currents. The impact
of these settings on model skill is quantified by comparison to the
observations. The skill is also compared to that from a global (thus, lower
resolution) ocean wave model.

### [3] [Intelligent Shanghai Typhoon Model (ISTM): A generative probabilistic emulator for typhoon hybrid modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16851)
*Zeyi Niu,Wei Huang,Sirong Huang,Bo Qin,Mengqi Yang,Haofei Sun,Zhaoyang Huo,Haixia Xiao*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: ISTM是一个基于UNet-Diffusion的两阶段生成概率预测系统，通过降尺度映射从25km粗分辨率到9km高分辨率，显著提升了台风强度和结构的预测精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工智能天气预报模型对台风强度系统性低估的问题

Method: 采用两阶段UNet-Diffusion框架，学习从25km ERA5再分析数据到9km高分辨率台风再分析数据集的降尺度映射

Result: 显著优于ERA5和基准UNet回归模型，在捕捉地表风和降水结构强度方面表现优异，能够有效增强台风强度预测同时保持路径精度

Conclusion: ISTM作为混合建模系统的高效AI模拟器，为AIWP和物理数值模型的协同进化建立了统一路径，推动了下一代台风预报能力的发展

Abstract: To address the systematic underestimation of typhoon intensity in artificial
intelligence weather prediction (AIWP) models, we propose the Intelligent
Shanghai Typhoon Model (ISTM): a unified regional-to-typhoon generative
probabilistic forecasting system based on a two-stage UNet-Diffusion framework.
ISTM learns a downscaling mapping from 4 years of 25 km ERA5 reanalysis to a 9
km high resolution typhoon reanalysis dataset, enabling the generation of
kilometer-scale near-surface variables and maximum radar reflectivity from
coarse resolution fields. The evaluation results show that the two-stage
UNet-Diffusion model significantly outperforms both ERA5 and the baseline UNet
regression in capturing the structure and intensity of surface winds and
precipitation. After fine-tuning, ISTM can effectively map AIFS forecasts, an
advanced AIWP model, to high-resolution forecasts from AI-physics hybrid
Shanghai Typhoon Model, substantially enhancing typhoon intensity predictions
while preserving track accuracy. This positions ISTM as an efficient AI
emulator of hybrid modeling system, achieving fast and physically consistent
downscaling. The proposed framework establishes a unified pathway for the
co-evolution of AIWP and physics-based numerical models, advancing
next-generation typhoon forecasting capabilities.

### [4] [SODA4: a mesoscale ocean/sea ice reanalysis 1980-2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17462)
*Gennady A. Chepurin,James A. Carton,Luyu Sun,Stephen G. Penny*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: SODA4是一个新的全球涡旋分辨率海洋/海冰再分析系统，覆盖1980-2024年，使用MOM5/SIS1数值模型和ERA5强迫，通过最优插值数据同化算法整合观测数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个改进的全球海洋再分析系统，提供更准确和可靠的海洋状态估计，减少观测数据稀疏和不均匀分布的影响

Method: 使用GFDL MOM5/SIS1数值模型和ECMWF ERA5强迫，结合表层和次表层温盐观测数据，采用最优插值数据同化算法进行约束

Result: SODA4温度盐度场偏差较小，显示出更多区域变异性，观测数据分布影响较小；主要海洋断面输运量与独立锚系观测结果一致

Conclusion: SODA4再分析系统在海洋状态估计方面表现良好，提供了可靠的全球海洋环流和变异性信息

Abstract: This paper describes the new Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 4 (SODA4)
global eddy-resolving ocean/sea ice reanalysis that spans the 45-year period
1980-2024. The reanalysis is constructed using GFDL MOM5/SIS1 numerics and
ECMWF ERA5 forcings with surface and subsurface temperature and salinity
observations as constraints within an optimal interpolation data assimilation
algorithm. The method of construction and resulting output files are described.
Comparison of the SODA4 temperature and salinity fields to observations and to
the UK Met Office EN4 temperature and salinity analyses in the upper ocean
shows SODA4 has marginal bias and exhibits more regional variability, with less
of an imprint of the sparse and inhomogeneous distribution of observations.
Comparison of transports across major ocean sections and passages are generally
consistent with independent moored observations.

### [5] [Learning from nature: insights into GraphDOP's representations of the Earth System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18018)
*Peter Lean,Mihai Alexe,Eulalie Boucher,Ewan Pinnington,Simon Lang,Patrick Laloyaux,Niels Bormann,Anthony McNally*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: GraphDOP模型仅基于气象观测数据训练，无需先验知识即可学习地球系统的状态、结构和动力学表示，以及不同观测系统的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络仅通过地球系统观测数据训练时，如何自发形成对物理世界的连贯内部表示，以增强对这些模型的理解并指导未来发展。

Method: 通过一系列实验分析GraphDOP模型，该模型仅使用气象观测数据进行训练，不依赖任何先验知识。研究关注模型构建的统一潜在状态表示、学习观测算子以及内部动力学表示。

Result: 模型成功构建了跨不同观测类型的统一地球系统状态表示；学会了模拟观测效应（如微波探测边缘效应和几何观测效应）；仅使用单一红外仪器观测就能推断未观测的非局部结构（如急流、气压模式和冷暖空气团）。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了神经网络仅通过观测数据训练就能自发发展出对物理世界的连贯内部表示，为理解和进一步发展这类模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Through a series of experiments, we provide evidence that the GraphDOP model
- trained solely on meteorological observations, using no prior knowledge -
develops internal representations of the Earth System state, structure and
dynamics as well as the characteristics of different observing systems.
Firstly, we demonstrate that the network constructs a unified latent
representation of the Earth System state which is common across different
observation types. For example, cloud structures maintain physical consistency
whether viewed in predictions for satellite radiances from different sensors,
or for direct in-situ measurements of the cloud fraction. Secondly, we show
examples that suggest that the network learns to emulate viewing effects -
learned observation operators that map from the unified state representation to
observed properties. Microwave sounder limb effects and geometric viewing
effects, such as sunglint in visible imagery, are both well captured. Finally,
we demonstrate that the model develops rich internal representations of the
structure of meteorological systems and their dynamics. For instance, when the
network is only provided with observations from a single infrared instrument,
it is able to infer unobserved, non-local structures such as jet streams,
surface pressure patterns and warm and cold air masses associated with synoptic
systems. This work provides insights into how neural networks trained solely on
observations of the Earth System spontaneously develop coherent internal
representations of the physical world in order to meet the training objective -
enhancing our understanding and guiding future development of these models.

### [6] [Not Just for Archiving: Provable Benefits of Reusing the Archive in Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16993)
*Shengjie Ren,Zimin Liang,Miqing Li,Chao Qian*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文分析证明在多目标进化算法中使用存档并重用存档解可以克服小种群限制，获得多项式级加速效果，理论分析和实验验证均支持这一结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多目标进化算法中常用存档存储非支配解来缓解种群震荡和使用更小种群，但本文发现单纯使用存档而不重用存档解在某些问题上可能失败，因此需要研究重用存档解的价值。

Method: 理论分析SMS-EMOA算法在OneJumpZeroJump问题及其变体上的表现，证明重用存档解的优势，并通过多目标0-1背包、TSP、QAP和NK-landscape四个实际问题进行实验验证。

Result: 证明重用存档解可以克服小种群限制，获得至少多项式级的运行时间加速，且重用存档解比直接使用大种群效果更好，实验结果支持理论发现。

Conclusion: 在多目标进化算法中重用存档解是有效的策略，能够显著提升算法性能，这一发现具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have become the most popular tool for solving
widely-existed multi-objective optimization problems. In Multi-Objective EAs
(MOEAs), there is increasing interest in using an archive to store
non-dominated solutions generated during the search. This approach can 1)
mitigate the effects of population oscillation, a common issue in many MOEAs,
and 2) allow for the use of smaller, more practical population sizes. In this
paper, we analytically show that the archive can even further help MOEAs
through reusing its solutions during the process of new solution generation. We
first prove that using a small population size alongside an archive (without
incorporating archived solutions in the generation process) may fail on certain
problems, as the population may remove previously discovered but promising
solutions. We then prove that reusing archive solutions can overcome this
limitation, resulting in at least a polynomial speedup on the expected running
time. Our analysis focuses on the well-established SMS-EMOA algorithm applied
to the commonly studied OneJumpZeroJump problem as well as one of its variants.
We also show that reusing archive solutions can be better than using a large
population size directly. Finally, we show that our theoretical findings can
generally hold in practice by experiments on four well-known practical
optimization problems -- multi-objective 0-1 Knapsack, TSP, QAP and
NK-landscape problems -- with realistic settings.

### [7] [Arc Routing Problems with Multiple Trucks and Drones: A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18105)
*Abhay Sobhanan,Hadi Charkhgard,Changhyun Kwon*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合遗传算法(HGA)来解决多卡车多无人机农村邮路问题(RPP-mTD)，通过双层染色体编码和局部搜索技术优化整体完工时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农村邮路问题在电力线路检查、城市巡逻等现场操作中至关重要。传统单车辆解决方案无法满足现代物流中多卡车多无人机协同作业的需求，需要开发高效的算法来处理这种复杂的组合优化问题。

Method: 采用混合遗传算法(HGA)，结合种群探索和邻域搜索。使用双层染色体编码：1)必需边的有序有向序列，2)车辆分配。引入保持片段交叉算子和多种局部搜索技术。

Result: 算法在单卡车无人机实例上表现出竞争力，在新的大规模实例上展示了良好的可扩展性。紧密集成的卡车-无人机车队显示出显著的操作优势。

Conclusion: HGA作为决策支持工具在实际混合车队物流中具有实用有效性，为复杂弧路由问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Arc-routing problems underpin numerous critical field operations, including
power-line inspection, urban police patrolling, and traffic monitoring. In this
domain, the Rural Postman Problem (RPP) is a fundamental variant in which a
prescribed subset of edges or arcs in a network must be traversed. This paper
investigates a generalized form of the RPP, called RPP-mTD, which involves a
fleet of multiple trucks, each carrying multiple drones. The trucks act as
mobile depots traversing a road network, from which drones are launched to
execute simultaneous service, with the objective of minimizing the overall
makespan. Given the combinatorial complexity of RPP-mTD, we propose a Hybrid
Genetic Algorithm (HGA) that combines population-based exploration with
targeted neighborhood searches. Solutions are encoded using a two-layer
chromosome that represents: (i) an ordered, directed sequence of required
edges, and (ii) their assignment to vehicles. A tailored segment-preserving
crossover operator is introduced, along with multiple local search techniques
to intensify the optimization. We benchmark the proposed HGA against
established single truck-and-drone instances, demonstrating competitive
performance. Additionally, we conduct extensive evaluations on new,
larger-scale instances to demonstrate scalability. Our findings highlight the
operational benefits of closely integrated truck-drone fleets, affirming the
HGA's practical effectiveness as a decision-support tool in advanced
mixed-fleet logistics.

*Yansong Du,Yutong Deng,Yuting Zhou,Feiyu Jiao,Jian Song,Xun Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的iToF-RGB融合框架，通过几何校准和双编码器网络解决iToF深度传感的低分辨率、窄视场和结构失真问题，实现深度超分辨率和视场扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 间接飞行时间(iToF)深度传感存在空间分辨率低、视场角有限以及在复杂场景中出现结构失真的固有限制，需要与RGB图像融合来提升性能。

Method: 首先通过精确的几何校准模块将窄视场iToF深度图重投影到宽视场RGB坐标系，确保模态间像素级对应；然后使用双编码器融合网络联合提取iToF深度和RGB图像的互补特征，并利用单目深度先验恢复精细结构细节和进行深度超分辨率。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在准确性、结构一致性和视觉质量方面显著优于最先进的方法，实现了增强的深度精度、改进的边缘锐度和无缝视场扩展。

Conclusion: 该iToF-RGB融合框架通过跨模态结构线索和深度一致性约束的有效整合，成功解决了iToF深度传感的关键限制，为多模态深度感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel iToF-RGB fusion framework designed to address the
inherent limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensing, such as
low spatial resolution, limited field-of-view (FoV), and structural distortion
in complex scenes. The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF
depth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric
calibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between
modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract
complementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by
monocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform
depth super-resolution. By integrating cross-modal structural cues and depth
consistency constraints, our approach achieves enhanced depth accuracy,
improved edge sharpness, and seamless FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy,
structural consistency, and visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountLoop是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过迭代结构化反馈为扩散模型提供精确的实例控制，在复杂高密度场景中实现高达98%的计数准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在逼真图像合成方面表现出色，但在生成具有精确对象实例数量的场景时仍然不可靠，特别是在复杂和高密度设置中。

Method: 采用训练免费框架，交替进行图像生成和多模态代理评估，包括语言引导的规划器和评论器评估对象计数、空间布局和属性一致性，并引入实例驱动的注意力掩码和组合生成技术。

Result: 在COCO Count、T2I CompBench和两个新的高实例基准测试中，CountLoop实现了高达98%的计数准确性，同时保持空间保真度和视觉质量，得分0.97，优于基于布局和梯度引导的基线方法。

Conclusion: CountLoop通过迭代结构化反馈有效解决了扩散模型在精确实例控制方面的局限性，为复杂场景生成提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image
synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise
number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings.
We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models
with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The
approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation,
where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial
arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine
layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between
objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention
masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I
CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves
counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual
quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score
of 0.97.

*Ashwath Vaithinathan Aravindan,Abha Jha,Mihir Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过机制可解释性技术分析发现，CLIP视觉编码器MLP层中的神经元存在特征叠加现象，这直接阻碍了组合特征表示能力，导致视觉语言模型在组合泛化和对象绑定方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现出色，但在组合泛化和对象绑定方面存在明显缺陷，限制了其处理新颖对象属性组合的能力。本研究旨在探索这些失败的根本原因。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析CLIP视觉编码器的MLP层，研究神经元特征表示的特性，特别是特征叠加现象对组合特征表示的影响。

Result: 发现CLIP视觉编码器MLP层中的单个神经元同时表示多个特征，这种"叠加"现象直接阻碍了组合特征表示能力，从而影响组合推理和对象绑定性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了视觉语言模型组合失败机制的根源，为理解模型内部工作机制提供了重要见解，是解决VLMs组合泛化问题的初步探索。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
integrating visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering. However, these models struggle with
compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to
handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores
the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of
CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition"
directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently
affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this
study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of
compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEViT是一个轻量级Vision Transformer模型，通过稀疏注意力机制和卷积块结合，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT模型存在计算成本高、模型尺寸大和局部特征建模能力弱的问题，限制了在实际场景中的应用。需要平衡计算效率和性能。

Method: 提出SAEViT模型，包含：1）稀疏聚合注意力模块(SAA)进行自适应稀疏采样；2）通道交互前馈网络(CIFFN)增强通道间信息交换；3）分层金字塔结构嵌入深度可分离卷积块(DWSConv)。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K分类任务上达到76.3%和79.6%的Top-1准确率，分别仅需0.8 GFLOPs和1.3 GFLOPs的计算量。

Conclusion: SAEViT提供了一个轻量级解决方案，在各种基础视觉任务中实现了计算效率和性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its
strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size
with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its
application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and
performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight
ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient
downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated
Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image
redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which
significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In
addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed
to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and
redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks
(FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise
separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen
convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that
SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K
classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively,
demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

*Chenghao Liu,Zhimu Zhou,Jiachen Zhang,Minghao Zhang,Songfang Huang,Huiling Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSNav是一个用于视觉语言导航的三模块框架，通过内存模块、空间模块和决策模块协同工作，解决了传统LLM方法在空间推理、跨模态对齐和长时记忆方面的缺陷，在R2R和REVERIE数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于单一LLM的视觉语言导航方法存在空间推理能力弱、跨模态对齐差、长时任务内存过载等关键缺陷，需要系统性地解决这些问题。

Method: 提出MSNav框架，包含三个模块：1）内存模块-动态地图内存，通过选择性节点剪枝处理内存过载；2）空间模块-空间推理和对象关系推断，提升终点识别能力；3）决策模块-基于LLM的路径规划执行稳健动作。还引入了I-O-S数据集并微调Qwen3-4B模型为Qwen-Spatial。

Result: 在Room-to-Room和REVERIE数据集上的广泛实验表明，MSNav实现了最先进的性能，在成功率和路径长度加权成功率方面均有显著提升。Qwen-Spatial在对象列表提取方面优于领先的商业LLM，在I-O-S测试集上获得更高的F1和NDCG分数。

Conclusion: MSNav通过将三个模块融合成协同架构，将脆弱的推理转变为稳健的集成智能，有效解决了视觉语言导航中的关键挑战，为多模态导航任务提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural
language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches
often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM)
makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities,
including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory
overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we
propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules
into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a
robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module,
a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node
pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial
reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition;
and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust
actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space
(I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp),
which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving
higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art
performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success
weighted by Path Length (SPL).

quality since it helps with risk reduction, performance improvement, and sound
decision-making . Artificial intelligence has recently been used in a number of
different fields. In this study, an intelligent model was constructed using
Convolutional Neural Networks to classify soil kinds, and machine learning
algorithms were used to enhance the performance of soil classification . To
achieve better implementation and performance of the Convolutional Neural
Networks algorithm and obtain valuable results for the process of classifying
soil type images, swarm algorithms were employed to obtain the best performance
by choosing Hyper parameters for the Convolutional Neural Networks network
using the Whale optimization algorithm and the Particle swarm optimization
algorithm, and comparing the results of using the two algorithms in the process
of multiple classification of soil types. The Accuracy and F1 measures were
adopted to test the system, and the results of the proposed work were efficient

TL;DR: 基于VLM的解释性质量评估框架QA-VLM，通过注意机制和领域知识提升了增材制造中的图像质量评估可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度学习方法在质量评估中的黑盒问题，提高模型的可信过性和实际应用采纳度

Method: 综合视觉-语言模型(VLM)的注意机制和推理能力，融合来自同行评审期刊的应用特定知识，构建QA-VLM框架

Result: 在24个单珍样品上验证，该框架在解释质量方面显示出比商用VLM更高的有效性和一致性

Conclusion: QA-VLM框架为增材制造领域提供了可信过、可解释的质量评估方案，具有广阔应用潜力

Abstract: Image-based quality assessment (QA) in additive manufacturing (AM) often
relies heavily on the expertise and constant attention of skilled human
operators. While machine learning and deep learning methods have been
introduced to assist in this task, they typically provide black-box outputs
without interpretable justifications, limiting their trust and adoption in
real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a novel QA-VLM framework that
leverages the attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs), enriched with application-specific knowledge
distilled from peer-reviewed journal articles, to generate human-interpretable
quality assessments. Evaluated on 24 single-bead samples produced by laser wire
direct energy deposition (DED-LW), our framework demonstrates higher validity
and consistency in explanation quality than off-the-shelf VLMs. These results
highlight the potential of our approach to enable trustworthy, interpretable
quality assessment in AM applications.

*Naren Sengodan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了The Loupe，一种轻量级即插即用的注意力模块，可插入预训练Transformer中，通过复合损失函数引导模型关注最具判别性的物体部位，无需部件级标注，在提升精度的同时提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类需要识别细微的局部视觉线索，在生物多样性监测和医疗诊断等关键应用中至关重要。虽然大规模视觉Transformer取得了先进性能，但其决策过程缺乏可解释性，难以在这些领域获得信任和验证。

Method: 设计The Loupe注意力模块，可插入Swin Transformer等预训练骨干网络。使用复合损失函数进行端到端训练，隐式引导模型关注最具判别性的物体部位，无需显式的部件级标注。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011数据集上，The Loupe将Swin-Base模型的准确率从85.40%提升至88.06%，显著提高了2.66%。注意力图分析显示该方法能有效定位语义上有意义的特征。

Conclusion: 简单的内在注意力机制可以作为强大的正则化器，在显著提升性能的同时提供清晰的视觉解释，为理解和信任模型决策过程提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area
within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle,
localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications
such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is
paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art
performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability
required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we
introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module
designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer.
The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly
guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without
requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in
demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a
powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously
providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the
challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of
a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%.
Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that
The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a
valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making
process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行导致全球医疗系统崩溃，呼吸系统衰竭是主要死因。通过AI分析CT扫描可以帮助医生更准确地判断病情严重程度，缓解医疗资源短缺问题

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)模型，基于患者COVID-19阳性检测后的肺部CT扫描数据进行训练和分析

Result: 模型能够在一个月内根据CT扫描预测COVID-19感染的严重程度，区分预后良好和不良（需要插管或死亡）的情况

Conclusion: 基于CNN的AI模型在COVID-19严重程度预测方面具有潜力，可以减少人为错误，提高诊断准确性，为医疗决策提供支持

Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious
communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A
pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was
not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people
worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the
respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive
research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being
lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying
gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as
there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and
ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of
this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the
patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less
prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to
give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a
Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our
model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the
positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or
unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT
scans in the dataset.

TL;DR: MedRepBench是一个针对中文医疗报告结构化理解的新基准测试，包含1900份真实医疗报告，用于评估视觉语言模型在医疗报告解释方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗报告解释在医疗保健中至关重要，但目前缺乏标准化基准来评估结构化医疗报告理解的质量，特别是在中文医疗场景下。

Method: 构建包含1900份去标识化中文医疗报告的基准测试，支持两种评估协议：客观评估（测量结构化临床项目的字段级召回率）和自动化主观评估（使用LLM作为评分代理评估事实性、可解释性和推理质量）。还设计了奖励函数并应用GRPO来改进VLM模型。

Result: 通过GRPO优化，中等规模VLM实现了高达6%的召回率提升。OCR+LLM管道虽然性能强劲，但存在布局盲区和延迟问题。

Conclusion: MedRepBench为医疗报告结构化理解提供了标准化评估框架，揭示了当前方法的局限性，并推动了向更鲁棒的全视觉报告理解系统的进一步发展。

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling
both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical
systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation
quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark
built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning
diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The
benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured
medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include
a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with
LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character
recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two
complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level
recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation
using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,
and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a
reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the
OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and
latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based
report understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在灾害应急响应中日益重要，但由于计算资源有限，无法独立运行大型模型进行实时视频分析

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用策略网络识别和丢弃冗余视频片段，引入站点机制利用未来帧信息提高准确性；第二阶段对分类为"火灾"的帧使用改进的YOLOv8模型定位火源

Result: 在FLAME和HMDB51数据集上评估第一阶段，在Fire & Smoke数据集上评估第二阶段。实验显示显著降低计算成本同时保持分类准确性，检测精度更高且推理时间相近

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了无人机平台计算资源有限的问题，实现了高效的实时野火监测和火源检测

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in
disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to
the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be
run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire
monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage
1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips
using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In
addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame
information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction
accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the
improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1
method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the
Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage
1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage
2 compared to baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于深度学习的CellEcoNet模型，通过将整片某某某某图像模拟为语言结构（细胞作为单词，细胞周围作为短语，织细架构作为句子），在预测侵某某某某复发风险方面显著超越传统分级和现有计算方法，并在多样化人群中表现一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前近七成侵某某某某患者在手术切除后五年内复发，而现有工具无法识别需要辅助治疗的患者，存在未满足的临床需求。

Method: 提出CellEcoNet深度学习框架，将整片某某某某图像通过自然语言比喻进行模型化，定义"病理语言"，其中细胞作为单词，细胞周围成为短语，织细架构形成句子。该模型自动学习这些上下文依赖的含义，捐据细微变化和空间交互作用来推断复发风险。

Result: 在456份H&E染色整片某某某某图像数据集上，CellEcoNet达到了优异的预测性能（AUC:77.8% HR:9.54），显著超过IASLC分级系统（AUC:71.4% HR:2.36）、AJCC分期（AUC:64.0% HR:1.17）和现有最优计算方法（AUCs:62.2-67.4%）。模型在不同人种和临床子群中都表现出公平性和一致性。

Conclusion: CellEcoNet不仅在预后预测方面取得成功，更标志着通过解码肝某某某某微环境的细胞"语言"来揭示细微细胞变化如何编码复发风险的范式转变。

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA)
patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those
needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce
CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole
slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of
pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases,
and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these
context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and
spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained
WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54),
outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0%
HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%).
CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse
demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a
paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to
reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用帕累托最优前沿评估文本到图像模型公平性和效用的方法，通过超参数优化来平衡公平性和视觉质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型的公平性评估主要依赖定性判断或有限比较，缺乏可重复的评估方法，难以同时评估公平性和效用

Method: 使用帕累托最优前沿分析不同去偏方法的超参数配置，采用归一化香农熵评估公平性，ClipScore评估效用

Result: 评估了Stable Diffusion、Fair Diffusion、SDXL、DeCoDi和FLUX等模型，发现大多数默认超参数配置在公平性-效用空间中不是最优解

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效比较不同文本到图像模型，找到优化公平性和效用的更好超参数配置，为负责任AI提供可重复的评估框架

Abstract: Achieving fairness in text-to-image generation demands mitigating social
biases without compromising visual fidelity, a challenge critical to
responsible AI. Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models
rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to
assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible
assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,
human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to
replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in
text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization
of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct
text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a
given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use
Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation,
respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair
Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that
most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated
solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find
better hyperparameters.

Method: 使用专家标注的真实Web数据构建多语言基准测试，统一评估三个核心Web任务：网站视觉问答、HTML/CSS/JavaScript代码编辑、原型到代码生成

Result: 多模态大语言模型在基础信息提取方面表现良好，但在推理和定位、保持代码功能的编辑、维护层次结构和支持多语言内容的设计到代码生成方面存在困难

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型存在重要局限性，需要改进多模态和跨语言推理能力，以构建能够自动化多样化Web开发任务的未来Web代理

Abstract: We present WebMMU, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web
tasks: (1) website visual question answering, (2) code editing involving
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and (3) mockup-to-code generation. Unlike prior benchmarks
that treat these tasks separately, WebMMU unifies them using expert-annotated,
real-world web data to assess models' abilities in complex multi-step
reasoning, precise element grounding, and functional UI comprehension and
coding. Our evaluation shows that while multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) perform well on basic information extraction, they struggle with
reasoning and grounding, editing code to preserve functionality, and generating
design-to-code that maintains hierarchy and supports multilingual content.
These findings reveal key limitations in current MLLMs and underscore the need
for improved multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning to build future web agents
capable of automating diverse web development tasks.

Abstract: Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations
remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models
for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising
strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce
RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables
fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic
attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first
model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,
facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic
dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to
evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification
models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data
naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data
for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through
extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,
we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model
performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness
across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a
6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,
compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic
data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction
of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the
potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical
deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code,
trained models, and synthetic dataset at

Conclusion: OVODA框架有效解决了开放词汇3D检测问题，同时发布了包含全面属性标注的OVAD数据集，推动了该研究方向的发展。

Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, yet existing
methods are limited by closed-set assumptions and struggle to recognize novel
objects and their attributes in real-world scenarios. We propose OVODA, a novel
framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with
no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to
bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting
attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such
research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D
object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA
incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature
concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for
attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal
flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets
show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection
while successfully recognizing object attributes. Our OVAD dataset is released

Conclusion: 该网络能够显著提高大规模天文巡天中超新星检测的准确性和效率，为天文瞬变检测提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate
classification of real and bogus transient detections in astronomical images.
This network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network
(CNN) methods, widely used in image processing tasks, by adopting an
architecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The
architecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only,
thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging,
while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using
the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network
achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility
for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments
with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even
when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These
findings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and
efficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely
adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal
action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps
at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their
practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In
this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive
alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion
action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling
through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We
integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO
benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its
diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving
substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a
promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without
compromising performance.

*Lihao Zhang,Zongtan Li,Haijian Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RF-PGS是一个新颖的框架，通过平面高斯和射频特定优化，从稀疏路径损耗谱重建高保真无线电传播路径，显著提高了6G空间信道建模的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G时代需要大规模天线阵列和精确的空间信道状态信息，传统信道建模方法在空间分辨率、效率和可扩展性方面面临挑战，现有辐射场方法存在几何不准确和成本高昂的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段使用平面高斯作为几何基元进行密集表面对齐场景重建；第二阶段结合全结构无线电辐射和定制多视图损失准确建模无线电传播行为。

Result: 相比现有辐射场方法，RF-PGS显著提高了重建精度，降低了训练成本，实现了无线信道的高效表示。

Conclusion: RF-PGS为可扩展的6G空间CSI建模提供了实用解决方案，解决了传统方法和现有辐射场方法的局限性。

Abstract: In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation
of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate
spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling
approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based
methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability.
Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still
suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes
RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation
paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as
geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves
dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training
stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed
fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss,
accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field
methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces
training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels,
offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.

TL;DR: GPO是一种新颖的可变形视网膜图像配准框架，通过高斯基元优化和结构化消息传递，有效解决了纹理稀疏区域的梯度消失问题，显著提升了配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜图像配准面临巨大挑战，因为大面积的同质区域和稀疏但关键的血管特征导致标准学习框架中的梯度信号有限，难以实现精确配准。

Method: 提出高斯基元优化(GPO)框架：首先进行粗对齐，然后在显著解剖结构处提取关键点作为描述符控制节点；每个节点建模为具有可训练位置、位移和半径的高斯基元；使用KNN高斯插值从信息丰富节点传播位移信号构建全局相干位移场。

Result: 在FIRE数据集上，GPO将目标配准误差从6.2像素降低到约2.4像素，并将25像素处的AUC从0.770提升到0.938，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPO通过在高梯度区域策略性地锚定节点，确保了稳健的梯度流，有效缓解了纹理稀疏区域的梯度消失问题，为可变形视网膜图像配准提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large
homogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause
limited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper,
we introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework
that performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an
initial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures
(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control
nodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable
position, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to
local deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation
then blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich
nodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing
interpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while
preserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient
regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal
in textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term
loss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.
Experiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration
error from 6.2\,px to ~2.4\,px and increases the AUC at 25\,px from 0.770 to
0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods. The source code can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在心理学领域有广阔应用潜力，但现有研究主要集中在情感识别能力上，而情感推理能力对于提升人机交互的自然性和有效性至关重要。

Method: 提出了MTMEUR测试集，包含1,451个真实场景视频和5,101个渐进式问题，覆盖情感识别、情感原因、未来行为预测等多个方面。同时提出多代理框架，每个代理专门处理背景上下文、角色动态和事件细节等特定方面。

Conclusion: 该研究弥补了多模态情感推理领域的研究空白，提供了一个综合性的测试标准和有效的多代理框架，为提升MLLMs在情感理解与推理方面的性能提供了重要支撑。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across
various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In
the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding
of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on
enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial
potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness
and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we
introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR)
benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along
with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects,
including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action
prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent
specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character
dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities.
Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based
method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant
challenges with this task.

TL;DR: Delta-SVD是一种无需训练的后处理压缩方法，通过奇异值分解(SVD)压缩DreamBooth微调产生的权重增量，实现显著存储压缩且保持生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化文本到图像模型如DreamBooth需要微调大规模扩散模型，导致存储大量特定主题模型时产生显著存储开销

Method: 利用权重增量具有强低秩结构的特点，应用奇异值分解分解权重增量，采用基于能量的秩截断策略平衡压缩效率和重建保真度

Result: 在多主题数据集上实现显著压缩，CLIP分数、SSIM和FID指标显示生成质量损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可扩展和高效的个性化扩散模型部署，是存储和部署大规模主题定制化实际应用的实用解决方案

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models such as DreamBooth require fine-tuning
large-scale diffusion backbones, resulting in significant storage overhead when
maintaining many subject-specific models. We present Delta-SVD, a post-hoc,
training-free compression method that targets the parameter weights update
induced by DreamBooth fine-tuning. Our key observation is that these delta
weights exhibit strong low-rank structure due to the sparse and localized
nature of personalization. Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank
truncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction
fidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be
re-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is
simple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments
on a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial
compression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score,
SSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of
personalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject
customizations.

Motivation: 在线互动中视觉内容的情感传达日益重要，但情感感知与复杂的场景级语义紧密相关，是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 提出MLLMsent框架，采用三种方法：(1)直接使用MLLM进行图像情感分类；(2)关联预训练LLM分析自动生成的图像描述；(3)在情感标注的图像描述上微调LLM。

Result: 在基准测试中，微调方法表现最佳，比Lexicon、CNN和Transformer基线分别高出30.9%、64.8%和42.4%。跨数据集测试中，未经训练仍比最佳对比方法高出8.26%。

Conclusion: 该视觉推理方案在情感计算方面具有巨大潜力，为未来研究设立了新的基准。

Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era
where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on
social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment
perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we
propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three
perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from
images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on
automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on
sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established
benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach,
achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and
Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively,
across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity
categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these
new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up,
which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential
of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing,
while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AWM-Fuse是一种新颖的多模态图像融合方法，通过全局和局部文本感知处理恶劣天气条件下的图像退化问题，利用BLIP和ChatGPT生成的文本描述来提升语义感知和图像融合质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态图像融合方法在恶劣天气条件下往往缺乏有效的文本信息整合，无法充分分析和分类文本内容，导致视觉信息丢失和语义感知不足。

Method: 提出AWM-Fuse方法，采用统一共享权重架构，包含全局特征感知模块（使用BLIP生成的整体场景描述）和局部模块（使用ChatGPT生成的详细场景描述），通过文本描述约束融合图像生成过程。

Result: 在复杂天气条件和下游任务中，AWM-Fuse超越了当前最先进的方法，表现出优异的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效整合文本信息，显著提升了恶劣天气条件下多模态图像融合的质量和语义对齐能力，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the
loss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing
clearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to
incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack
effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response,
we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions,
designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text
perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a
global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract
overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting
generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this,
the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to
concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues,
thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to
constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network
learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby
promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Feecuin/AWM-Fuse.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多维图像质量评估框架MDIQA，从技术和美学等多个维度建模图像质量，并通过调整维度权重灵活应用于图像恢复任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像质量评估方法主要关注整体分数拟合，忽略了人类通常从多个维度评估图像质量的事实。

Method: 构建多分支网络结构，分别训练技术和美学等9个感知维度，然后将各维度特征融合生成最终质量分数。

Result: 在多个实验中表现出优越性能，并能有效灵活地应用于图像恢复任务。

Conclusion: MDIQA框架能够更好地捕捉人类视觉感知的多维度特性，为图像质量评估和恢复提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image quality assessment (IQA), driven by
sophisticated deep neural network designs, have significantly improved the
ability to approach human perceptions. However, most existing methods are
obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans
typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at
an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a
multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we
model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five
technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of
human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is
initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the
respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score.
Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible
training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to
better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual
dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves
superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image
restoration tasks. The code is available: https://github.com/YaoShunyu19/MDIQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEGS是一个无需训练、即插即用的框架，通过定义结构能量并注入梯度来引导采样过程，有效解决文本到3D生成中的Janus问题（多视角几何不一致）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到3D生成存在Janus问题，即物体从正面看正确但从其他角度观察时几何结构重复或扭曲，这源于2D扩散先验中的视角偏差。

Method: 提出结构能量引导采样(SEGS)，在U-Net中间特征的PCA子空间中定义结构能量，将其梯度注入去噪轨迹，在采样时强制多视角一致性。

Result: SEGS显著减少了Janus伪影，实现了更好的几何对齐和视角一致性，且无需重新训练或修改权重。

Conclusion: SEGS框架有效解决了文本到3D生成中的视角一致性问题，为提升3D生成质量提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation often suffers from the Janus problem, where objects
look correct from the front but collapse into duplicated or distorted geometry
from other angles. We attribute this failure to viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion
priors, which propagates into 3D optimization. To address this, we propose
Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS), a training-free, plug-and-play
framework that enforces multi-view consistency entirely at sampling time. SEGS
defines a structural energy in a PCA subspace of intermediate U-Net features
and injects its gradients into the denoising trajectory, steering geometry
toward the intended viewpoint while preserving appearance fidelity. Integrated
seamlessly into SDS/VSD pipelines, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts,
achieving improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without
retraining or weight modification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSPCaps是一个新颖的多尺度胶囊网络架构，通过多尺度特征提取、统一补丁化胶囊层和跨协议路由机制，有效解决了传统胶囊网络忽略多尺度特征和特征融合困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胶囊网络通常依赖单一高层特征图，忽略了多尺度特征的丰富互补信息，且传统特征融合策略难以协调多尺度特征差异，导致分类性能不佳。

Method: 提出MSPCaps架构，包含三个核心组件：多尺度ResNet骨干网络(MSRB)、补丁化胶囊层(PatchifyCaps)和跨协议路由(CAR)块。MSRB提取多尺度特征，PatchifyCaps将特征统一分割成胶囊，CAR通过识别最大协议跨尺度预测对来自适应路由。

Result: MSPCaps在分类准确率上持续超越多个基线方法，展现出卓越的可扩展性和鲁棒性，参数规模从高效的Tiny模型(344.3K)到强大的Large模型(10.9M)。

Conclusion: 该方法在推进特征表示学习方面具有巨大潜力，通过有效整合多尺度特征学习和高效胶囊路由，显著提升了胶囊网络的性能。

Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) has demonstrated significant potential in visual
recognition by capturing spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies for
learning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and
variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich
complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional
feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to
reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal
classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the
Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that
integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.
Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet
Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement
Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature
representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and
global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these
multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,
equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.
Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by
identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the
simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the
most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps
achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently
surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with
configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)
to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in
advancing feature representation learning.

Conclusion: CC-CMR展示了在广泛人群和医疗环境中进行心肌病筛查的临床可行性，为无钆对比剂的心血管疾病筛查提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Cardiomyopathy, a principal contributor to heart failure and sudden cardiac
mortality, demands precise early screening. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR),
recognized as the diagnostic 'gold standard' through multiparametric protocols,
holds the potential to serve as an accurate screening tool. However, its
reliance on gadolinium contrast and labor-intensive interpretation hinders
population-scale deployment. We propose CC-CMR, a Contrastive Learning and
Cross-Modal alignment framework for gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening
using cine CMR sequences. By aligning the latent spaces of cine CMR and Late
Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) sequences, our model encodes fibrosis-specific
pathology into cine CMR embeddings. A Feature Interaction Module concurrently
optimizes diagnostic precision and cross-modal feature congruence, augmented by
an uncertainty-guided adaptive training mechanism that dynamically calibrates
task-specific objectives to ensure model generalizability. Evaluated on
multi-center data from 231 subjects, CC-CMR achieves accuracy of 0.943 (95% CI:
0.886-0.986), outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3% while
eliminating gadolinium dependency, demonstrating its clinical viability for
wide range of populations and healthcare environments.

Conclusion: 该框架通过建立3D-文本对齐，为3D内容个性化提供了高效便捷的解决方案，显著降低了计算成本

Abstract: Recent advances in NeRF and 3DGS have significantly enhanced the efficiency
and quality of 3D content synthesis. However, efficient personalization of
generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization
approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which
require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D
content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable
direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces.
However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images
preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our
approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations
and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned
3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding
aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and
personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the
need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在单一中间层最大化干净图像和对抗图像的嵌入分离，往往过度关注少数代表相似概念的神经元，而忽略层内其他神经元。NAT旨在通过神经元级别的攻击来更有效地破坏神经网络的核心单元。

Method: NAT（Neuron Attack for Transferability）方法从嵌入级分离转向更基础的神经元特异性方法，针对嵌入中的特定神经元进行攻击，训练生成器来最大化神经元级别的扰动效果。

Result: 在41个不同的ImageNet模型和9个细粒度模型上的广泛实验表明，NAT在跨模型设置中超过现有基线14%以上，在跨域设置中超过4%。通过利用训练生成器的互补攻击能力，仅需10次查询就能获得令人印象深刻的欺骗率。

Conclusion: 针对单个神经元的攻击能有效破坏神经网络的核心单元，为不同模型间的可迁移性提供了共同基础，NAT方法在对抗性攻击的可迁移性方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: The generation of transferable adversarial perturbations typically involves
training a generator to maximize embedding separation between clean and
adversarial images at a single mid-layer of a source model. In this work, we
build on this approach and introduce Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a
method designed to target specific neuron within the embedding. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that previous layer-level optimizations often
disproportionately focus on a few neurons representing similar concepts,
leaving other neurons within the attacked layer minimally affected. NAT shifts
the focus from embedding-level separation to a more fundamental,
neuron-specific approach. We find that targeting individual neurons effectively
disrupts the core units of the neural network, providing a common basis for
transferability across different models. Through extensive experiments on 41
diverse ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models, NAT achieves fooling rates
that surpass existing baselines by over 14\% in cross-model and 4\% in
cross-domain settings. Furthermore, by leveraging the complementary attacking
capabilities of the trained generators, we achieve impressive fooling rates
within just 10 queries. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: HieroAction是一个视觉语言模型，通过分步动作推理和分层策略学习，提供准确且可解释的人类动作评估，在多个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只提供最终评分而缺乏解释性分析，限制了在体育、医疗和机器人等领域的实际应用。需要能够提供结构化评估和详细反馈的方法。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 分步动作推理 - 专门设计的思维链过程，从整体识别到子动作分析再到最终评分；2) 分层策略学习 - 强化学习策略，学习细粒度子动作动态并与高级动作质量对齐。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，证明了该模型能够提供准确且可解释的动作评估。

Conclusion: HieroAction通过结合分步推理和策略学习，实现了准确、结构化且可解释的人类动作评估，解决了现有方法缺乏详细反馈的问题。

Abstract: Evaluating human actions with clear and detailed feedback is important in
areas such as sports, healthcare, and robotics, where decisions rely not only
on final outcomes but also on interpretable reasoning. However, most existing
methods provide only a final score without explanation or detailed analysis,
limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce
HieroAction, a vision-language model that delivers accurate and structured
assessments of human actions. HieroAction builds on two key ideas: (1) Stepwise
Action Reasoning, a tailored chain of thought process designed specifically for
action assessment, which guides the model to evaluate actions step by step,
from overall recognition through sub action analysis to final scoring, thus
enhancing interpretability and structured understanding; and (2) Hierarchical
Policy Learning, a reinforcement learning strategy that enables the model to
learn fine grained sub action dynamics and align them with high level action
quality, thereby improving scoring precision. The reasoning pathway structures
the evaluation process, while policy learning refines each stage through reward
based optimization. Their integration ensures accurate and interpretable
assessments, as demonstrated by superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: RPD-Diff是一种区域自适应物理引导去雾扩散模型，通过物理引导中间状态定位策略和雾感知去噪时间步预测器，有效处理密集非均匀雾霾场景下的图像去雾问题。

Conclusion: RPD-Diff通过结合物理引导和区域自适应机制，有效解决了密集非均匀雾霾条件下的图像去雾挑战，为复杂雾霾场景下的能见度增强提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Single-image dehazing under dense and non-uniform haze conditions remains
challenging due to severe information degradation and spatial heterogeneity.
Traditional diffusion-based dehazing methods struggle with insufficient
generation conditioning and lack of adaptability to spatially varying haze
distributions, which leads to suboptimal restoration. To address these
limitations, we propose RPD-Diff, a Region-adaptive Physics-guided Dehazing
Diffusion Model for robust visibility enhancement in complex haze scenarios.
RPD-Diff introduces a Physics-guided Intermediate State Targeting (PIST)
strategy, which leverages physical priors to reformulate the diffusion Markov
chain by generation target transitions, mitigating the issue of insufficient
conditioning in dense haze scenarios. Additionally, the Haze-Aware Denoising
Timestep Predictor (HADTP) dynamically adjusts patch-specific denoising
timesteps employing a transmission map cross-attention mechanism, adeptly
managing non-uniform haze distributions. Extensive experiments across four
real-world datasets demonstrate that RPD-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
performance in challenging dense and non-uniform haze scenarios, delivering
high-quality, haze-free images with superior detail clarity and color fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LIMM模型，通过窗口划分和对比学习增强局部建模能力，在人群计数任务中实现SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考人群计数的本质特征——个体在图像中占比很小，现有方法过度追求大感受野而忽视了局部建模能力的重要性

Method: 采用窗口划分设计将输入分割为网格窗口，使用窗口级对比学习增强局部密度区分能力，最后加入全局注意力模块处理大尺寸个体

Result: 在多个公开数据集上显著提升局部建模能力（如JHU-Crowd++高密度子集MAE提升8.7%），同时保持对大尺寸个体的计数能力，达到SOTA性能

Conclusion: 强调局部建模能力是人群计数模型设计的重要原则，LIMM模型通过创新的窗口策略和对比学习有效解决了局部信息处理问题

Abstract: The motivation of this paper originates from rethinking an essential
characteristic of crowd counting: individuals (heads of humans) in the crowd
counting task typically occupy a very small portion of the image. This
characteristic has never been the focus of existing works: they typically use
the same backbone as other visual tasks and pursue a large receptive field.
This drives us to propose a new model design principle of crowd counting:
emphasizing local modeling capability of the model. We follow the principle and
design a crowd counting model named Local Information Matters Model (LIMM). The
main innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that
applies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning
design to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density
levels. Moreover, a global attention module is applied to the end of the model
to handle the occasionally occurring large-sized individuals. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets illustrate that the proposed model
shows a significant improvement in local modeling capability (8.7\% in MAE on
the JHU-Crowd++ high-density subset for example), without compromising its
ability to count large-sized ones, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了RDR框架和SciDiagram-Robust数据集，通过多视图一致性验证机制增强多模态大语言模型对视觉扰动（噪声、模糊、遮挡）的鲁棒性，并引入新的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准忽视了多模态大语言模型在真实科学文档中常见视觉扰动下的鲁棒性问题，限制了其在实际科学工程应用中的部署。

Method: 采用自适应多视图与一致性验证（AMCV）机制，生成多个扰动版本图表进行并行推理，并通过一致性自校正循环提升性能。构建了首个大规模科学图表问答数据集SciDiagram-Robust。

Result: 实验表明即使是GPT-4V等最先进模型在扰动输入下性能显著下降（清洁准确率85.2% vs PRS 72.1%），验证了现有模型的鲁棒性不足。

Conclusion: RDR框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型在视觉退化科学图表上的推理鲁棒性，为实际科学应用中的可靠部署提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants (LVLMs) hold
immense promise for scientific and engineering applications, particularly in
processing visual information like scientific diagrams. However, their
practical deployment is hindered by a critical lack of robustness to common
visual perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusions, which are prevalent
in real-world scientific documents. Existing evaluation benchmarks largely
overlook this challenge, leaving the robust reasoning capabilities of LVLMs on
visually degraded scientific diagrams underexplored. To address this, we
introduce the Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework, a novel approach
designed to enhance and rigorously evaluate LVLMs' performance under such
conditions. At its core, RDR employs an Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency
Verification (AMCV) mechanism, which involves generating multiple perturbed
versions of a diagram, performing parallel inference, and then applying a
consistency-based self-correction loop. We also propose two new metrics,
Perturbation Robustness Score (PRS) and Visual Degradation Consistency (VDC),
to quantify robustness. Furthermore, we construct SciDiagram-Robust, the first
large-scale scientific diagram question-answering dataset specifically
augmented with diverse, programmatically generated visual perturbations. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art closed-source
LVLMs like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with
perturbed inputs (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%).

Motivation: 现实世界数据往往呈现不平衡分布，传统回归模型在罕见观测值上表现不佳，需要解决不平衡回归问题

Method: 提出平衡锐度感知最小化(BSAM)，从传统锐度感知最小化出发，引入目标重加权策略来均匀化观测空间的泛化能力

Result: 在年龄估计和深度估计等多个视觉回归任务上的广泛实验表明，BSAM方法持续优于现有方法

Conclusion: BSAM通过平衡泛化能力有效解决了不平衡回归问题，提供了理论泛化边界保证

Abstract: Regression is fundamental in computer vision and is widely used in various
tasks including age estimation, depth estimation, target localization, \etc
However, real-world data often exhibits imbalanced distribution, making
regression models perform poorly especially for target values with rare
observations~(known as the imbalanced regression problem). In this paper, we
reframe imbalanced regression as an imbalanced generalization problem. To
tackle that, we look into the loss sharpness property for measuring the
generalization ability of regression models in the observation space. Namely,
given a certain perturbation on the model parameters, we check how model
performance changes according to the loss values of different target
observations. We propose a simple yet effective approach called Balanced
Sharpness-Aware Minimization~(BSAM) to enforce the uniform generalization
ability of regression models for the entire observation space. In particular,
we start from the traditional sharpness-aware minimization and then introduce a
novel targeted reweighting strategy to homogenize the generalization ability
across the observation space, which guarantees a theoretical generalization
bound. Extensive experiments on multiple vision regression tasks, including age
and depth estimation, demonstrate that our BSAM method consistently outperforms
existing approaches. The code is available

Conclusion: HCG-LVLM的分层设计有效增强了细粒度视觉语言理解和精确定位能力，验证了从粗到细认知处理方式在提升模型性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing and multimodal
understanding. Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, current
LVLMs often exhibit insufficient robustness, proneness to hallucination, and
reasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when precise
image region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning are required. To
address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding
LVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine
cognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global
Contextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained
Local Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement
Module to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator
to ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an
adaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for
robust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets,
including GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring
Expression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4. Our model
achieves superior accuracy and significantly reduces hallucination, validating
the effectiveness of its hierarchical design in enhancing fine-grained
visual-language understanding and precise grounding capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全参数微调会损害预训练模型固有泛化能力的问题，需要在任务适应和泛化保持之间取得平衡。

Result: 在基准实验中，JPS相比最先进的领域泛化方法取得了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: JPS方法通过稀疏参数更新策略，既高效又有效地实现了领域泛化，理论分析也为其提供了原理性支持。

Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of
source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target
domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained
vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full
fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these
models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies
have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively
fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of
generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter
Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse
subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization
strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization
error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates,
thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning.
Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to
identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients
across all source domains. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that JPS
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain
generalization methods, substantiating both the efficiency and efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Motivation: 扩散模型计算成本高昂，现有特征缓存方法因无法建模复杂特征演化动态而导致质量损失

Method: 利用扩散变换器中特征导数近似呈现多元高斯特性的洞察，采用Hermite多项式作为理论基础，并引入双尺度机制确保数值稳定性

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev上实现6.24倍加速且质量超过基线，在文本到图像、视频生成和超分辨率任务中均表现优异

Conclusion: HiCache通过理论对齐和经验特性结合，为扩散模型提供了高效且高质量的加速解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but
suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While
recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal
extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the
failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this
problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework
that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools
with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative
approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian
characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially
theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We
further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability
while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate
HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding
baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video
generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the
appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy,
surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis.
While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant
progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational
efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize
performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy
for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient
dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features
a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at
training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the
noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.
Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),
and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature
representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale
segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss
function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA
segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets.
EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse
dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while
significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared
to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice
score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding
performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong
generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code,
pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at

Conclusion: CPC通过结合大语言模型和对比学习，有效解决了视觉相似类别混淆问题，在弱监督语义分割任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has
gained attention for its cost-effectiveness. Most existing methods emphasize
inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related
categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose
Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large
Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic
inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level
contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation.
This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors
while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among
visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014
demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its
traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex
environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and
repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting
(GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate
fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We
propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured
marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for
efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within
cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional
image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We
further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This
agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of
dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of
perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准扩散模型在手写文本生成中容易记忆训练样本，对风格变化敏感，且在高引导强度下产生噪声和伪影，影响生成文本的可读性

Method: Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG)策略，利用负向提示的正交投影到原始正向提示，在潜在空间中提供更稳定的解耦方向，并采用三角形调度控制去噪过程中的引导强度

Result: 在DiffusionPen和One-DM上的实验表明，DOG提高了内容清晰度和风格多样性，即使对于词汇表外单词和挑战性书写风格也有效

Conclusion: DOG方法相比标准CFG更稳定，能够生成更清晰、更多样化的手写文本，解决了扩散模型在手写文本生成中的关键问题

Abstract: Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve
impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time
and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples
and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In
particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions
that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when
the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an
orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original
positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts
while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet
plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which
relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales,
DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To
control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a
triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process
is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on
the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both
content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and
challenging writing styles.

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision,
Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The
sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers
their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA)
model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed
representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model
incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages
these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby
enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level
video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的局部聚焦机制(LFM)来解决深度假写检测中的跨领域转移性问题，通过重点关注匿作特征来提高检测的准确性和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的重建学习方法基于深度卷积网络，存在跨物体类别和生成域的转移性差、全局平均池化损失关键局部特征等问题。

Method: 提出局部聚焦机制(LFM)，整合显著性网络(SNet)和Top-K池化(TKP)模块来选择K个最有信息的局部模式，并使用秩基线性滴落(RBLD)和随机K采样(RKS)正则化技术防止过拟合。

Conclusion: LFM为跨域深度假写检测设置了新的标杆，通过重点关注局部匿作特征显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the
need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based
on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to
extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization
across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains
(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep
CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic
feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,
especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)
compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding
discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these
issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends
to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM
integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)
module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential
overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization
techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which
enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and
a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel
Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789
FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for
cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food content has intensified the need for robust
and accurate systems capable of fine-grained visual understanding and
retrieval. In this work, we address the challenging task of food image-to-text
matching, a critical component in applications such as dietary monitoring,
smart kitchens, and restaurant automation. We propose F4-ITS: Fine-grained
Feature Fusion for Food Image-Text Search, a training-free, vision-language
model (VLM)-guided framework that significantly improves retrieval performance
through enhanced multi-modal feature representations. Our approach introduces
two key contributions: (1) a uni-directional(and bi-directional) multi-modal
fusion strategy that combines image embeddings with VLM-generated textual
descriptions to improve query expressiveness, and (2) a novel feature-based
re-ranking mechanism for top-k retrieval, leveraging predicted food ingredients
to refine results and boost precision. Leveraging open-source image-text
encoders, we demonstrate substantial gains over standard baselines - achieving
~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse caption
scenarios, and a ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Additionally,
we show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger
counterparts (e.g., ViT-H, ViT-G, ViT-bigG) when augmented with textual fusion,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: 3D mapping in dynamic environments poses a challenge for modern researchers
in robotics and autonomous transportation. There are no universal
representations for dynamic 3D scenes that incorporate multimodal data such as
images, point clouds, and text. This article takes a step toward solving this
problem. It proposes a taxonomy of methods for constructing multimodal 3D maps,
classifying contemporary approaches based on scene types and representations,
learning methods, and practical applications. Using this taxonomy, a brief
structured analysis of recent methods is provided. The article also describes
an original modular method called M3DMap, designed for object-aware
construction of multimodal 3D maps for both static and dynamic scenes. It
consists of several interconnected components: a neural multimodal object
segmentation and tracking module; an odometry estimation module, including
trainable algorithms; a module for 3D map construction and updating with
various implementations depending on the desired scene representation; and a
multimodal data retrieval module. The article highlights original
implementations of these modules and their advantages in solving various
practical tasks, from 3D object grounding to mobile manipulation. Additionally,
it presents theoretical propositions demonstrating the positive effect of using
multimodal data and modern foundational models in 3D mapping methods. Details

Conclusion: PVNet通过扩散模型和点-体素交互有效解决了室外场景点云稀疏性问题，为下游3D感知任务提供了高质量点云数据

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding in outdoor environments heavily relies on
high-quality point clouds. However, LiDAR-scanned data often suffer from
extreme sparsity, severely hindering downstream 3D perception tasks. Existing
point cloud upsampling methods primarily focus on individual objects, thus
demonstrating limited generalization capability for complex outdoor scenes. To
address this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel
interaction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense
supervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to
guide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding
condition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as
the input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete
the coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In
addition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features
from both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental
perception capability of each upsampled point. To the best of our knowledge,
our approach is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling method supporting
arbitrary upsampling rates. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source

Motivation: 现有的场景流估计方法主要关注两帧输入，忽略了时序域中有价值的信息。虽然近期趋势转向多帧推理，但随着帧数增加计算成本急剧上升。同时面临类别分布不平衡和运动不一致等挑战

Method: 提出DeltaFlow框架，采用Δ方案以最小计算成本捕获运动线索；引入类别平衡损失增强对少数类别的学习；使用实例一致性损失确保物体运动的一致性

Conclusion: DeltaFlow通过高效的时序特征提取和专门的损失函数设计，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了场景流估计的准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input
from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal
domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer
from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To
leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow
($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a
$\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost,
regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces
challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion
inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to
enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency
Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on the Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets show that $\Delta$Flow
achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$
faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while
also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/Kin-Zhang/DeltaFlow along with trained model

Abstract: Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape
the player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative
engagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological
breakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have
significantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true
photorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a
major challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In
this short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of
rendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we
propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative
Network framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image
translation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that
transform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task.
This enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time
inference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach
achieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired
Im2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also
indicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced
by directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to
translate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of
real-world images. Code, pre-trained models, and demos for this work are

TL;DR: SSG-DiT是一个新颖的可控视频生成框架，通过空间信号引导和两阶段解耦过程，显著提升了生成视频与文本提示的语义一致性，在VBench基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控视频生成模型在保持强语义一致性方面存在困难，经常生成与提示细节不符的视频内容，需要解决这一关键挑战。

Method: 提出SSG-DiT框架，采用解耦的两阶段过程：1) 空间信号提示阶段利用预训练多模态模型生成空间感知视觉提示；2) 通过轻量级SSG-Adapter将联合条件注入冻结的视频DiT主干，采用双分支注意力机制同时利用生成先验和外部空间信号。

Result: 在VBench基准测试的多个关键指标上超越现有模型，特别是在空间关系控制和整体一致性方面表现优异，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SSG-DiT通过空间信号引导和高效的适配器设计，有效解决了可控视频生成中的语义一致性问题，为高质量视频合成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns
precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial
images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing
models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently
generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the
prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided
Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity
controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage
process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware
visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained
multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint
condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our
lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring
a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness
its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external
spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key
metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control
and overall consistency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架，通过将视觉Transformer与近端工具相结合，以突破传统ViT在全局几何关系建模上的限制，提升了特征表示和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然ViT通过自注意力机制在计算机视觉领域取得了显著成功，但其优化仅限于建模单张图像内部的局部关系，无法抓取数据点之间的全局几何关系。

Method: 提出的框架中，ViT通过自注意力机制构建流形的切线束，每个注意力头对应一个切线空间，提供来自不同局部视角的几何表示。然后引入近端迭代来定义切线束内的截面并将数据从切线空间投影到基空间，实现全局特征对齐和优化。

Result: 实验结果证实，所提方法在分类准确率和数据分布方面都超过了传统ViT方法。

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合近端工具与ViT架构，成功地扩展了深度学习模型的几何建模能力，为提升特征表示和分类性能提供了有效的全局优化方案。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in
computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable
success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains
confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its
ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach
to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this
framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its
self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent
space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives.
Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent
bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving
global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that
the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification
accuracy and data distribution.

Result: 在细粒度分类和人脸验证等任务上达到与最先进方法相当的性能

Conclusion: PD-Loss为嵌入优化提供了新的视角，具有更广泛的应用潜力，实现了计算效率和分布感知的平衡

Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn embedding functions that map
semantically similar inputs to proximate points in a metric space while
separating dissimilar ones. Existing methods, such as pairwise losses, are
hindered by complex sampling requirements and slow convergence. In contrast,
proxy-based losses, despite their improved scalability, often fail to optimize
global distribution properties. The Decidability-based Loss (D-Loss) addresses
this by targeting the decidability index (d') to enhance distribution
separability, but its reliance on large mini-batches imposes significant
computational constraints. We introduce Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss), a
novel objective that integrates learnable proxies with the statistical
framework of d' to optimize embedding spaces efficiently. By estimating genuine
and impostor distributions through proxies, PD-Loss combines the computational
efficiency of proxy-based methods with the principled separability of D-Loss,
offering a scalable approach to distribution-aware DML. Experiments across
various tasks, including fine-grained classification and face verification,
demonstrate that PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art methods while introducing a new perspective on embedding
optimization, with potential for broader applications.

Conclusion: 复杂的地理空间分割行为可以通过强化学习从弱空间线索中学习，GRASP框架有效利用了基础模型的先验知识，最小化了可训练参数，并能从廉价标注中学习。

Abstract: Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to
generate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions.
Prevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with
dense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain
(OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our
design, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding
boxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are
then passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts
to generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the
system purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with
GRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and
points (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation
models, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive
annotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains
reasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained
segmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test
sets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to
54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust
generalization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors
can be learned via RL from weak spatial cues. Code and the dataset will be
released open-source.

Abstract: Despite progress in AI-based plant diagnostics, sugarcane farmers in
low-resource regions remain vulnerable to leaf diseases due to the lack of
scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools. Many deep learning models fail to
generalize under real-world conditions and require substantial computational
resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained regions. In this paper,
we present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease
classification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid
on-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field
deployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes,
including four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse
field conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we
combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and
more representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers
the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device
diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98,
and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we
fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet,
EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning
and Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to
SugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and
computation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We
integrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based
explanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse
benchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool
for sugarcane disease classification. It spans varied lighting, backgrounds and

*Mirza Mumtaz Zahoor,Saddam Hussain Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CE-RS-SBCIT的新型混合框架，结合残差空间学习CNN和Transformer模块，用于脑肿瘤MRI图像的准确分类，在多个数据集上达到98%以上的性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN和Transformer在脑肿瘤MRI分类中存在计算成本高、对对比度变化敏感、结构异质性和纹理不一致等挑战，需要开发更高效的混合架构。

Method: 集成四个核心创新：(i)平滑边界CNN集成Transformer(SBCIT)；(ii)定制残差和空间学习CNN；(iii)通道增强策略；(iv)新型空间注意力机制，通过stem卷积和上下文交互Transformer块实现全局特征建模。

Result: 在Kaggle和Figshare的MRI数据集上评估，涵盖胶质瘤、脑膜瘤、垂体瘤和健康对照，达到98.30%准确率、98.08%灵敏度、98.25% F1分数和98.43%精确度。

Conclusion: CE-RS-SBCIT框架通过整合局部细粒度和全局上下文线索，有效解决了脑肿瘤MRI分类中的挑战，展现了卓越的分类性能。

Abstract: Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early
detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic
(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%
sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

Abstract: Natural disasters pose significant challenges to timely and accurate damage
assessment due to their sudden onset and the extensive areas they affect.
Traditional assessment methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and hazardous
to personnel, making them impractical for rapid response, especially in
resource-limited settings. This study proposes a novel, cost-effective
framework that leverages aerial drone footage, an advanced AI-based video
super-resolution model, Video Restoration Transformer (VRT), and Gemma3:27b, a
27 billion parameter Visual Language Model (VLM). This integrated system is
designed to improve low-resolution disaster footage, identify structural
damage, and classify buildings into four damage categories, ranging from
no/slight damage to total destruction, along with associated risk levels. The
methodology was validated using pre- and post-event drone imagery from the 2023
Turkey earthquakes (courtesy of The Guardian) and satellite data from the 2013
Moore Tornado (xBD dataset). The framework achieved a classification accuracy
of 84.5%, demonstrating its ability to provide highly accurate results.
Furthermore, the system's accessibility allows non-technical users to perform
preliminary analyses, thereby improving the responsiveness and efficiency of
disaster management efforts.

Motivation: 传统视频学习被动且缺乏动态互动，现有AI工具只有转录和摘要功能，无法实现实时、区域特定的交互。需要开发能够增强用户参与度和理解力的交互式视频学习系统。

Method: 集成GPT API和计算机视觉技术，通过视频预处理提取、处理和结构化视频内容。利用标注帧而非原始坐标数据来解决GPT-4o的空间定位弱点，提高视频内容定位和解释的准确性。

Abstract: Traditional video-based learning remains passive, offering limited
opportunities for users to engage dynamically with content. While current
AI-powered tools offer transcription and summarization, they lack real-time,
region-specific interaction capabilities. This paper introduces Untwist, an
AI-driven system that enables interactive video learning by allowing users to
ask questions about the entire video or specific regions using a bounding box,
receiving context-aware, multimodal responses. By integrating GPT APIs with
Computer Vision techniques, Untwist extracts, processes, and structures video
content to enhance comprehension. Our approach addresses GPT-4o spatial
weakness by leveraging annotated frames instead of raw coordinate data,
significantly improving accuracy in localizing and interpreting video content.
This paper describes the system architecture, including video pre-processing
and real-time interaction, and outlines how Untwist can transform passive video
consumption into an interactive, AI-driven learning experience with the
potential to enhance engagement and comprehension.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究使用隐式神经表示方法结合T1和T2加权MRI的优势，构建了各向同性的内侧颞叶亚区分割图谱，提高了阿尔茨海默病影像生物标志物的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内侧颞叶是阿尔茨海默病最早出现病变的区域，但由于T2加权MRI的各向异性分辨率限制，难以准确提取皮质亚区厚度等影像生物标志物。

Method: 采用隐式神经表示方法，结合T1和T2加权MRI的分辨率优势，将各向异性的MTL亚区图谱上采样到各向同性空间，建立多模态高分辨率图谱集，并开发各向同性分割模型。

Result: 在各向同性模型下提取的皮质亚区厚度在区分轻度认知障碍和认知正常参与者时表现出更高的显著性，且在纵向分析中显示出更好的稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法在不增加图谱标注工作量的情况下提高了AD影像生物标志物的准确性，有助于更精确量化AD与脑萎缩的关系，为疾病追踪提供更准确的测量指标。

Abstract: Imaging biomarkers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important tools
for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD). As medial temporal lobe
(MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused
by AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions
and extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to
imaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic,
which makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical
subregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation
method to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to
accurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to
isotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set.
Based on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation
model. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted
using this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic
method in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment
and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the
biomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU
participants. This study improved the accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without
increasing the amount of atlas annotation work, which may help to more
accurately quantify the relationship between AD and brain atrophy and provide
more accurate measures for disease tracking.

such as DROID-SLAM, AnyCam, and Monst3r and combines preprocessing techniques
such as different methods of masking, temporal chunking, and resolution scaling
to account for dynamic motion and computational constraints. We show that Vroom
is able to partially recover track and vehicle trajectories in complex

for scalable 4D reconstruction in real-world settings. The project page can be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AdvCP方法解决弱监督变化检测中的背景变化误判问题，通过对抗性提示挖掘和样本校正来提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督变化检测仅依赖图像级标签，容易将背景变化误判为目标变化，特别是在复杂的遥感场景中

Method: AdvCP包含两个阶段：1) 对抗性提示挖掘 - 使用错误标签激活错误特征映射，挖掘易被误分类的背景变化特征；2) 对抗性样本校正 - 构建在线全局原型，整合对抗性样本进行训练

Result: 在ConvNet、Transformer和SAM等baseline上均取得显著性能提升，且可推广到其他多类弱监督密集预测场景

Conclusion: AdvCP方法能有效解决弱监督变化检测中的共现噪声问题，无需增加推理成本，具有良好的通用性

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object
changes (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations
(e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in
paired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level)
classification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense
annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as
image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene,
WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes,
especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an
Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise
problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each
training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using
incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.
This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,
namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as
object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these
adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an
online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted
moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP
can be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding
additional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment
Anything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance
enhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to
other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios. Code is
available at https://github.com/zhenghuizhao/AdvCP

TL;DR: 提出基于专家混合策略的多智能体框架，用于高速公路场景理解，通过大VLM生成任务特定的思维链提示来指导小VLM进行多模态推理，在天气分类、路面湿度和交通拥堵检测等任务上实现准确高效的多任务推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高速公路场景下多任务感知的挑战，需要同时处理天气、路面状况和交通流量等多种信息，传统方法往往单一任务且计算效率低，需要一种能够平衡准确性和计算效率的综合解决方案。

Method: 采用混合专家策略的多智能体框架，使用大型通用视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o）生成任务特定的思维链提示，然后指导小型高效VLM（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B）对短视频进行多模态推理，结合道路天气传感器等多模态数据。

Conclusion: 该框架可轻松集成到现有交通摄像头系统中，特别适用于高风险农村地区（如急弯、洪水易发低地或结冰桥梁）的持续监控，即使在资源受限环境下也能提供及时警报，显著提升情境感知能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene
understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this
framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is
contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to
guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short
videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework
simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather
classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,
achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and
computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three
specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness
dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data,
highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and
environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be
readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically
applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone
lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the
system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in
resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 现有数据集无法支持从纯文本文档生成对应封面图像的任务，需要开发低成本构建高质量数据集的方法。

Method: 提出多模态伪标注方法：收集含多图像和摘要的文档，通过独立排名图像和标题，选择两者均排名第一的图像作为伪标注，并移除包含直接图像引用的文档。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法构建的数据集比仅考虑文本或图像的单模态方法更精确，生成的图像质量更高。

Conclusion: 多模态伪标注方法能有效构建封面图像生成任务所需的高质量数据集，为文档到图像的跨模态生成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel cover image generation task that produces
both a concise summary and a visually corresponding image from a given
text-only document. Because no existing datasets are available for this task,
we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality
datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images
with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent
instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying
the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images
and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the
image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective
rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references
within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal
pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher
quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which
consider captions and images separately. We release our code at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoViPAL是一种层级的上下文视觉token剪枝方法，通过轻量级插件模块在LVLM处理前预测和移除冗余视觉token，显著提升推理效率而不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型处理图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算成本高和内存开销大。现有剪枝方法在浅层缺乏足够上下文信息时效果不佳，但许多视觉token在浅层就存在固有冗余。

Method: 提出CoViPAL方法，使用即插即用剪枝模块(PPM)在LVLM处理前预测和移除冗余视觉token。PPM轻量级、模型无关，可独立于LVLM架构运行。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CoViPAL在相同token预算下优于无需训练的剪枝方法，在可比监督下超越基于训练的方法。

Conclusion: CoViPAL为提升LVLM推理效率提供了可扩展的高效解决方案，在不影响准确性的前提下显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of
text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich
visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,
leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant
memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant
vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.
However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of
sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are
inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively
pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a
layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a
Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision
tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,
model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring
seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods
under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable
supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve
inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

Motivation: 现有深度神经网络在感知错觉轮廓（如abutting grating）方面与人类感知模式存在差异，需要开发更符合人类感知机制的模型

Method: 提出ICPNet网络，包含：1）多尺度特征投影模块提取多尺度表示；2）特征交互注意力模块增强前馈和反馈特征交互；3）边缘融合模块通过边缘检测任务注入形状约束

Conclusion: 该工作向基于DNN的模型实现人类水平智能迈出了一步，通过模拟视觉皮层电路提高了模型与人类感知的对齐度

Abstract: Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception
and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have
demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks.
Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory
contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human
perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep
network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the
circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection
(MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the
interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction
attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the
shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via
the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network
to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST
test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.
Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more
sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,
with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work
is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based
models.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的MKD方法有效解决了多模态数据获取困难的问题，在仅使用H&E染色病理图像的情况下显著提升了IHC生物标记物预测的准确性

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker prediction benefits from multi-modal data
fusion analysis. However, the simultaneous acquisition of multi-modal data,
such as genomic and pathological information, is often challenging due to cost
or technical limitations. To address this challenge, we propose an online
distillation approach based on Multi-modal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) to
enhance IHC biomarker prediction in haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained
histopathology images. This method leverages paired genomic-pathology data
during training while enabling inference using either pathology slides alone or
both modalities. Two teacher and one student models are developed to extract
modality-specific and modality-general features by minimizing the MKD loss. To
maintain the internal structural relationships between samples,
Similarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) is applied. Additionally,
Collaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) facilitates mutual
learning between teacher and student models, encouraging diverse and
complementary learning dynamics. Experiments on the TCGA-BRCA and in-house QHSU
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in IHC
biomarker prediction using uni-modal data. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 注意力增强的CNN结合目标损失优化和预处理，能够提供高准确、计算高效的自动化ALL诊断工具

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in
both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise
subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex,
time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework
for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines
a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we
insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model
long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features.
To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated
architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25%
accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results
indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization
and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell
morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient
tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate
diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

TL;DR: 开发深度学习模型来自动化测量CT图像中的骨骼肌面积，用于检测肌肉减少症，平均误差±3%，Dice相似系数达93%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌肉减少症与不良手术结果相关，但通过CT图像测量骨骼肌面积的过程耗时且增加临床工作量，需要更高效和可扩展的自动化解决方案

Method: 采用迁移学习和自监督学习方法，利用标记和未标记的CT扫描数据集开发深度学习模型，定量评估骨骼肌面积

Result: 模型预测骨骼肌面积的平均误差为±3个百分点，预测掩模的平均Dice相似系数达到93%

Conclusion: 该方法展示了肌肉减少症评估和检测完全自动化的可行途径，解决了类别不平衡和数据有限的问题

Abstract: Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of muscle mass and function linked to poor
surgical outcomes such as prolonged hospital stays, impaired mobility, and
increased mortality. Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional
imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming
and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management;
however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the
assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents
high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images
of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon
Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the
SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We
develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this
task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning
approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed
qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the
quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach
also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our
model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points
against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of
the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full
automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉预训练表示主要基于2D图像，忽略了世界的3D本质，但由于大规模3D数据的稀缺性，难以从网络数据集中提取通用3D表示

Method: 将视觉预训练目标构建为下一个点云预测问题，使用扩散模型作为预测模型，直接在大型公共数据集上进行预训练

Result: 在12个真实世界操作任务中，FVP将3D Diffusion Policy的平均成功率提升28%，达到模仿学习方法的最先进性能，并能适应不同的点云编码器和数据集

Conclusion: FVP框架有效提升了3D表示性能，可应用于不同模型架构，为机器人学习提供了强大的4D视觉预训练解决方案

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics
have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot
learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are
mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However,
due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a
universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a
general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations
as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training
framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training
objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model
as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets
directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average
success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP
pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning
methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud
encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger
Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various
robot tasks. Our project page is available at: https://4d-

TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于组合式视觉推理的综合性综述，系统回顾了2023-2025年间260多篇论文，分析了该领域的发展历程、方法分类、基准测试和未来挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合式视觉推理作为多模态AI的关键研究方向，需要人类般的分解视觉场景、中间概念定位和多步逻辑推理能力。现有综述主要关注单一视觉语言模型或通用多模态推理，缺乏对快速发展的组合式视觉推理文献的专门综合。

Abstract: Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in
multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to
decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step
logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language
models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly
expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill
this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically
reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We
first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches
offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,
interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm
shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced
LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and
unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and
limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that
probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding
accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.
Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges
(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward
deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark
limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration,
human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering
a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims
to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of
compositional visual reasoning research.

### [83] [PersPose: 3D Human Pose Estimation with Perspective Encoding and Perspective Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17239)
*Xiaoyang Hao,Han Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PersPose是一个新的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过引入透视编码(PE)和透视旋转(PR)来解决裁剪图像中缺乏相机内参信息和透视失真的问题，在多个数据集上达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D人体姿态估计方法仅使用裁剪图像作为输入，但缺乏相机内参信息导致无法准确估计关节的相对深度。此外，人体偏离图像中心会导致透视失真，增加模型拟合难度。

Method: 提出PersPose框架：1) 透视编码(PE)来编码裁剪图像的相机内参；2) 透视旋转(PR)将人体置于图像中心以减少透视失真；3) 结合PE和PR构建完整的3D姿态估计框架。

Result: 在3DPW、MPI-INF-3DHP和Human3.6M数据集上达到最先进性能。在3DPW数据集上MPJPE为60.1mm，比之前最佳方法降低了7.54%。

Conclusion: PersPose通过显式处理相机内参和透视失真问题，显著提升了单目3D人体姿态估计的精度，特别是在野外场景下的性能表现。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of
joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped
image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints
cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding
camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D
objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding
(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the
human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective
relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,
which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject
deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the
cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a
transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,
thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of
model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,
PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPIINF-3DHP, and Human3.6M
datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an
MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is
available at: https://github.com/ KenAdamsJoseph/PersPose.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理半结构化表格图像、数值推理和跨语言场景方面存在明显不足，需要专门的基准来评估和改进这些能力。

Method: 构建包含1,463张合成板球记分卡图像（ODI、T20和测试赛格式）和1,500个英文问答对的数据集，分为英文记分卡和印地文记分卡两个子集，所有问题答案均为英文以控制跨文字评估。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了当前LVLM在半结构化表格理解、数值推理和跨语言能力方面的重大挑战，为相关研究提供了重要的评估工具和方向指引。

Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA)
on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models
(LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured

QA pairs. It includes two subsets: MMCRICBENCH-E-1.5K, featuring English
scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi
scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled
cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical
data, multi-image context, and implicit domain knowledge. Empirical results
show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle
on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and
exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key
limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning,
and cross-lingual generalization. The dataset is publicly available via Hugging

Motivation: 现有方法为每种条件类型训练单独的控制分支，导致模型结构冗余和计算资源使用效率低下，需要统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出CoMoE模块聚合语义相似的补丁特征并分配给专用专家模块，以及WeaveNet动态连接机制实现主干网络和控制分支的有效交互。

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by
leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing
methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,
leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational
resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation
(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing
generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely
existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable
conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert
(CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and
assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and
conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features
under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement
and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge
the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose
WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective
interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and
fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the
Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image
generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and
effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次提出并验证了多重嵌入攻击(MEA)的存在，当受保护图像经历多轮水印嵌入时，原始取证水印会被破坏。作者提出了对抗干扰模拟(AIS)训练范式，通过模拟MEA场景和稀疏稳定水印表示学习，显著提升了现有方法对MEA的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的快速发展和数字媒体的广泛传播，个人隐私面临严重安全威胁。现有的深度伪造主动取证方法依赖于单一水印嵌入的理想化假设，这在现实场景中不切实际。

Method: 提出对抗干扰模拟(AIS)训练范式，在微调过程中显式模拟MEA场景，并引入弹性驱动的损失函数来强制学习稀疏且稳定的水印表示，而不需要修改网络架构。

Result: 大量实验表明，AIS训练范式显著增强了各种现有方法对MEA的鲁棒性，使模型在经历第二次嵌入后仍能正确提取原始水印。

Conclusion: AIS作为一种即插即用的训练范式，有效解决了多重嵌入攻击对主动取证机制的威胁，为深度伪造防御提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies and the wide dissemination
of digital media, personal privacy is facing increasingly serious security
threats. Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible
watermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense
against these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability,
they rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which
proves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define
and demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first
time. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of
watermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or
removed, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To
address this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named
Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network
architecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and
introduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse
and stable watermark representations. Our method enables the model to maintain
the ability to extract the original watermark correctly even after a second
embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play AIS
training paradigm significantly enhances the robustness of various existing
methods against MEA.

TL;DR: FedKLPR是一个轻量级、通信高效的联邦学习框架，用于行人重识别，通过KL散度正则化、加权聚合、稀疏激活跳过和跨轮恢复等机制，在非IID数据分布下显著减少通信开销并保持模型精度。

Motivation: 解决联邦学习在行人重识别应用中面临的两个主要挑战：跨客户端的统计异构性（非IID数据分布）和大规模模型频繁传输带来的巨大通信开销。

Method: 提出四个关键组件：1）KL散度正则化损失约束本地模型；2）KL散度剪枝加权聚合整合剪枝比例和分布相似性；3）稀疏激活跳过避免关键参数稀释；4）跨轮恢复动态控制剪枝机制。

Result: 在八个基准数据集上的实验表明，FedKLPR显著减少通信成本：ResNet-50减少33%-38%，ResNet-34减少20%-40%，同时模型精度下降控制在1%以内。

Conclusion: FedKLPR框架有效解决了联邦学习在行人重识别中的统计异构性和通信开销问题，实现了通信效率与模型精度的良好平衡。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent
surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without
centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems
faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to
non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by
frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we
propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning
framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.
First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by
minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively
mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence
stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted
Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into
the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model
while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse
Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during
the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from
the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic
pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper
compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication
reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\%
communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34,
while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition
costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial
environments, such as offshore oil platforms. The practical and economic
barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper
the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this
work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines
procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages
BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and
controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2
world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with
temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We
demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset,
blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance
compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1
mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the
real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first
approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing
reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained
industrial applications.

Conclusion: SEER-VAR为基于LLM的AR推荐系统在自我中心驾驶场景中提供了有效基础，代码和数据集将开源，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: We present SEER-VAR, a novel framework for egocentric vehicle-based augmented

(CASB), and LLM-driven recommendation. Unlike existing systems that assume
static or single-view settings, SEER-VAR dynamically separates cabin and road
scenes via depth-guided vision-language grounding. Two SLAM branches track
egocentric motion in each context, while a GPT-based module generates
context-aware overlays such as dashboard cues and hazard alerts. To support
evaluation, we introduce EgoSLAM-Drive, a real-world dataset featuring
synchronized egocentric views, 6DoF ground-truth poses, and AR annotations
across diverse driving scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that SEER-VAR
achieves robust spatial alignment and perceptually coherent AR rendering across
varied environments. As one of the first to explore LLM-based AR recommendation
in egocentric driving, we address the lack of comparable systems through
structured prompting and detailed user studies. Results show that SEER-VAR
enhances perceived scene understanding, overlay relevance, and driver ease,
providing an effective foundation for future research in this direction. Code

Motivation: 解决无标注图像理解的高成本问题，结合两种方法的优势：DINO的师生蒸馏学习和Barlow Twins的冗余减少目标，克服各自局限性（DINO对增强敏感，Barlow Twins需要大批次）。

Method: 将Barlow Twins的冗余减少目标与DINO的自蒸馏策略相结合，在MS COCO数据集上使用仅10%标注数据进行线性探测训练，并与独立DINO和Barlow Twins模型进行对比评估。

Result: 混合模型在损失和分类准确率上与DINO相当，同时保持强特征表示能力。注意力可视化显示混合模型具有改进的语义分割能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下训练ViT提供了一种可扩展、标签高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a
challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and
Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with
fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have
independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each
comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and
Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware.
By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the
self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary
strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of
labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against
standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that
the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to
DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations
further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model.
This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for
training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 当前MRI工作流程是碎片化的多阶段过程，现有深度学习方法缺乏通用性，且很少整合影像数据和临床语言信息。

Method: 基于60个公共数据集的大规模异构语料库训练，包含多阶段训练范式：自监督视觉预训练、视觉-语言对齐、多模态预训练和多任务指令调优。

Conclusion: OmniMRI有潜力将碎片化流程整合为可扩展的通用框架，为统一影像和临床语言的基础模型铺平道路。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but
remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing
acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting.
While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing
approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability
across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate
imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on
in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language
foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI
is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public
datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating
image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its
multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining,
vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction
tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual
representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following
capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform
diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction,
anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic
suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's
potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist
framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and
clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

Result: CLIFF实现了具有竞争力的准确率，相比朴素微调和基于提示的基线方法，显著降低了遗忘问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为二维材料领域的持续学习提供了首个系统性解决方案，通过创新的框架设计有效解决了材料间外观变化带来的分类挑战，为量子硬件的可扩展发展提供了重要技术支持。

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however,
automated layer classification from optical microscopy remains challenging due
to substantial appearance shifts across different materials. In this paper, we
propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification
(CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual
learning in the domain of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Our method enables
the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical
properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference
material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt,
embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate
modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we
incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves
competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning
and a prompt-based baseline.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MetaDSL领域特定语言、MetaDB数据库和MetaBench基准测试套件，用于解决超材料设计中的几何复杂性和结构-性能映射难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超材料的设计面临几何复杂性和从结构到性能的非平凡映射挑战，需要系统化的设计框架和工具支持。

Method: 开发了MetaDSL（紧凑的领域特定语言）、MetaDB（包含15万+参数化程序的数据库）和MetaBench（测试视觉语言模型能力的基准套件）。

Result: 建立了最先进视觉语言模型的基线性能，并在CAD式交互界面中部署了全模型，展示了结构-表示-性能关系的集成设计能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为实现超材料结构-表示-性能关系的集成设计和理解提供了重要基础，是迈向自动化超材料设计的重要一步。

Abstract: Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly
tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult
because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to
behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.
(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000
parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their
derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated
elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core
capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies
show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design
and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

TL;DR: 提出AdaGAT方法，通过动态调整引导模型的训练状态来增强目标模型的对抗鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗蒸馏方法中使用可学习引导模型时，由于引导模型从零开始学习，难以在协同训练中保持最优状态进行有效知识迁移

Method: 开发AdaGAT方法，包含两个独立的损失函数，使引导模型更积极参与反向传播以达到最优状态

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet数据集上实验表明，在适当精度范围内调整引导模型能显著提升目标模型对各种对抗攻击的鲁棒性

Conclusion: AdaGAT方法通过动态调整引导模型的训练状态，有效解决了对抗蒸馏中引导模型优化问题，显著提升了学生模型的鲁棒性表现

Abstract: Adversarial distillation (AD) is a knowledge distillation technique that
facilitates the transfer of robustness from teacher deep neural network (DNN)
models to lightweight target (student) DNN models, enabling the target models
to perform better than only training the student model independently. Some
previous works focus on using a small, learnable teacher (guide) model to
improve the robustness of a student model. Since a learnable guide model starts
learning from scratch, maintaining its optimal state for effective knowledge
transfer during co-training is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel
Adaptive Guidance Adversarial Training (AdaGAT) method. Our method, AdaGAT,
dynamically adjusts the training state of the guide model to install robustness
to the target model. Specifically, we develop two separate loss functions as
part of the AdaGAT method, allowing the guide model to participate more
actively in backpropagation to achieve its optimal state. We evaluated our
approach via extensive experiments on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
TinyImageNet, using the WideResNet-34-10 model as the target model. Our
observations reveal that appropriately adjusting the guide model within a
certain accuracy range enhances the target model's robustness across various
adversarial attacks compared to a variety of baseline models.

Abstract: LiDAR scanning in outdoor scenes acquires accurate distance measurements over
wide areas, producing large-scale point clouds. Application examples for this
data include robotics, automotive vehicles, and land surveillance. During such
applications, outlier objects from outside the training data will inevitably
appear. Our research contributes a novel approach to open-set segmentation,
leveraging the learnings of object defect-detection research. We also draw on
the Mamba architecture's strong performance in utilising long-range
dependencies and scalability to large data. Combining both, we create a
reconstruction based approach for the task of outdoor scene open-set
segmentation. We show that our approach improves performance not only when
applied to our our own open-set segmentation method, but also when applied to
existing methods. Furthermore we contribute a Mamba based architecture which is
competitive with existing voxel-convolution based methods on challenging,
large-scale pointclouds.

Conclusion: 提出的TMR方法通过简单的模板匹配和回归结构，在少样本模式检测任务中取得了优异性能，证明了经典方法的有效性。

Abstract: We address the problem of few-shot pattern detection, which aims to detect
all instances of a given pattern, typically represented by a few exemplars,
from an input image. Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot
object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks
have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to
localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous
FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed
prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template
matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial
layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of
learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We
also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of
patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and
FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

Abstract: In trustworthy medical diagnosis systems, integrating out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection aims to identify unknown diseases in samples, thereby
mitigating the risk of misdiagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OOD
detection framework based on vision-language models (VLMs), which integrates
hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that
resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is
proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the
detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination
of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation
strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental
evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed
framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing
methods. The source code is available at https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/OpenMedIA/HVL.

Motivation: 传统的多模态融合范式和固定追踪模板限制了特征交互能力，需要提升RGB-T追踪的表征学习能力

Method: 提出MTNet追踪器：1)模态感知网络（包含通道聚合分布模块CADM和空间相似性感知模块SSPM）探索模态特征线索；2)Transformer融合网络捕捉全局依赖关系；3)三叉预测头和动态更新策略保持可靠模板

Result: 在三个RGBT标准数据集上达到了满意的结果，性能超过当前最先进方法，同时实现了实时追踪速度

Conclusion: MTNet通过模态感知网络和Transformer融合网络有效提升了RGB-T追踪的表征学习能力，为多模态追踪提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a
critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion
paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature
interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on
transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented
to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and
distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A
transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to
reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle
the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident
prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable
template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments
validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with
the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching
real-time speed.

Conclusion: 该框架通过MLLM偏好理解与扩散模型导向的无练集成，实现了高效、灵活的实时偏好对齐生成，支持广泛且细微的用户偏好覆盖

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet
achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner
remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected
preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user
intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned
T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal
large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two
components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For
preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global
preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using
structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more
fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For
preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and
local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model
without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global
attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round
interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected
benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for
dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了元学习在自动化模型适应专门分割任务方面的潜力

Abstract: Foundation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) exhibit strong zero-shot
image segmentation performance, but often fall short on domain-specific tasks.
Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and
domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven
approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image
segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework,
QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and
performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million
possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass
segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that
QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses
AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within
three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as
well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model

Conclusion: UniSino通过在投影域直接处理数据，为CT成像提供了一种通用的投影数据标准化解决方案，相比传统方法具有更好的泛化性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the
collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts
and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy.
Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed
empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across
heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino,
a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing
foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes
data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across
diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the
physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling
robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction
quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional
robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging. The code

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型中视觉token过多导致的推理效率低下问题，需要在压缩token的同时尽可能保留视觉信息

Method: 1. 图基视觉token聚合(VTA)：将视觉token视为节点构建语义相似图，将移除token的信息聚合到保留token中；2. 分组token选择策略(GTS)：基于文本token指导将视觉token分组为保留和移除两类，逐步聚合视觉信息

Conclusion: VISA方法有效解决了MLLM中视觉token过多的问题，在保持视觉信息完整性的同时显著提升推理效率，为多模态模型优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method called group-wise \textbf{VI}sual
token \textbf{S}election and \textbf{A}ggregation (VISA) to address the issue
of inefficient inference stemming from excessive visual tokens in multimoal
large language models (MLLMs). Compared with previous token pruning approaches,
our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual
tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module.
VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic
similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed
tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual
token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection
strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by
text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively
aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual
information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate
the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods,
achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising is crucial for reduced radiation
exposure while ensuring diagnostically acceptable image quality. Despite
significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing
DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical
region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical
heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their
generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we
propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable
LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff
employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive
denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language
image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy
perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn
continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify
salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware
diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by
synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP
into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB)
based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing
eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising
performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the
remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels. The codes and models are

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single
to Multi Image VQA (MVQA). However, the increased number of images in MVQA
inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to
question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To
address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number
of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments,
which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper,
we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy,
which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant
accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the
results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further
introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal
performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The
code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: PosBridge框架具有实用价值和广泛应用潜力，为无需训练的定制化图像编辑提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Localized subject-driven image editing aims to seamlessly integrate
user-specified objects into target scenes. As generative models continue to
scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation,
highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this
end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting
custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding
transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the
structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the
Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background
image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising,
positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in
the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner
Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize
identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of
highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital
forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly
rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook
subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection
framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel
edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance
from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the
observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures,
weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a
post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to
fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency.
Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance
across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on
CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results
establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective
solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for
real-world applications in automated content verification and digital
forensics.

Result: 该方法在竞赛中获得第一名，明显优于第二名，证明了针对特定问题本质进行优化的有效性。

Conclusion: 在分割竞赛中，针对具体问题的本质特性（如小麦茎秆的细长结构和类别不平衡）进行专门优化，比使用通用技巧更能获得竞争优势，简单的针对性改进可以带来显著的性能提升。

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution during the participation of the MLCAS
2025 GWFSS Challenge. This challenge hosts a semantic segmentation competition
specific to wheat plants, which requires to segment three wheat organs
including the head, leaf, and stem, and another background class. In 2025,
participating a segmentation competition is significantly different from that
in previous years where many tricks can play important roles. Nowadays most
segmentation tricks have been well integrated into existing codebases such that
our naive ViT-Adapter baseline has already achieved sufficiently good
performance. Hence, we believe the key to stand out among other competitors is
to focus on the problem nature of wheat per se. By probing visualizations, we
identify the key -- the stem matters. In contrast to heads and leaves, stems
exhibit fine structure and occupy only few pixels, which suffers from fragile
predictions and class imbalance. Building on our baseline, we present three
technical improvements tailored to stems: i) incorporating a dynamic upsampler
SAPA used to enhance detail delineation; ii) leveraging semi-supervised guided
distillation with stem-aware sample selection to mine the treasure beneath
unlabeled data; and iii) applying a test-time scaling strategy to zoom in and
segment twice the image. Despite being simple, the three improvements bring us
to the first place of the competition, outperforming the second place by clear
margins. Code and models will be released at

TL;DR: 开发轻量级视觉语音识别架构，降低硬件成本同时保持良好性能


<details>

Motivation: 现有VSR系统依赖深度神经网络，计算成本高，硬件需求大，限制了在实际资源受限场景中的应用和部署

Method: 采用标准双网络设计范式，首先对图像分类中的高效模型进行基准测试，然后在时序卷积网络骨干中采用轻量级块设计，开发统一的低资源需求模型

Result: 在最大的英语单词公共数据库上的实验证明了所开发模型的有效性和实用性

Conclusion: 成功开发了具有低硬件成本但强大识别性能的轻量级VSR架构，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input
sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems
include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system
is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is
corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words,
these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract
meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures
achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs
significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands
in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in
real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents
wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical
applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing
architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard
two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature
extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the
entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first
benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and
then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network
backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but
strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for
English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed
models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法为主动Deepfake检测提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，通过纹理引导的扰动框架实现了对伪造内容的主动防御

Abstract: The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to
social trust and information security. While most existing detection methods
primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake
contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals
in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake
detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more
sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations
within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized
perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in
non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts
preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then
introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture
perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the
promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and
producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an
efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.

Conclusion: 动态推理-感知协调为视频理解提供了可扩展的范式，显著提升了视频问答系统的性能

Abstract: Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning
and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However,
current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that
decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through
premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive
processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual
extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand
fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this
work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video
understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional
approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA
creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual
extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three
innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames;
(2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3)
confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA
(76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic
reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video
understanding.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了从RGB图像生成光谱BRDF，支持任意光照和形状的光谱渲染，解决了光谱数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for
photorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that
convert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method
that generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions
(BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image
rendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding
material. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of
measured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial
Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across
wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to
leverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation.
Experiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from
limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral
image reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data
will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据具有动态演化的特性，数据分布的变化会对模型性能产生重大影响。持续学习框架能够让模型在保持已有知识的同时适应新的数据分布，因此需要研究VAD模型在CL场景下的应用。

Method: 采用基于PatchCore的持续学习版本PatchCoreCL模型，在具有图像级和像素级注释的真实医学影像数据集BMAD上进行评估。

Result: PatchCoreCL表现出色，性能与任务特定模型相当，忘记率仅为1%，证明了持续学习在医学影像异常检测中的可行性和潜力。

Conclusion: 这项研究首次证明了持续学习在医学影像异常检测中的有效性，PatchCoreCL模型为适应性VAD提供了一个可行的解决方案，具有重要的应用前景。

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and
precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on
normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such
as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and
explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of
evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention,
even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In
particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data,
Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to
incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This
study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL
scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the
well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its
performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both
image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that
PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the
task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the
feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

Motivation: 虽然CAM是深度学习模型可解释性的重要方法，但其在不同噪声干扰下的稳健性研究不足，需要系统性评估和量化。

Method: 通过在多种模型架构和数据集上测试不同噪声干扰对CAM解释的影响，提出了一种稳健性评估指标，包含一致性（预测类别不变时CAM的稳定性）和响应性（预测变化时CAM的敏感度）。

Result: 发现不同CAM方法对噪声的敏感度存在显著差异，通过统计测试验证了所提指标的可用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为CAM方法的稳健性评估提供了量化方法，显示了不同方法在噪声干扰下的表现差异，对提高模型可解释性的可靠性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing
regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise
remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of
various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple
architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types
on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to
which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings
highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We
propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties:
consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to
remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class,
while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the
prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically
across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary
statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

Conclusion: HiDA-Net框架能有效保留原生分辨率细节，显著提升高分辨率AI生成图像检测性能，并提供了新的基准数据集推动后续研究。

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution, meticulously crafted AI-generated images
poses a significant challenge to existing detection methods, which are often
trained and evaluated on low-resolution, automatically generated datasets that
do not align with the complexities of high-resolution scenarios. A common
practice is to resize or center-crop high-resolution images to fit standard
network inputs. However, without full coverage of all pixels, such strategies
risk either obscuring subtle, high-frequency artifacts or discarding
information from uncovered regions, leading to input information loss. In this
paper, we introduce the High-Resolution Detail-Aggregation Network (HiDA-Net),
a novel framework that ensures no pixel is left behind. We use the Feature
Aggregation Module (FAM), which fuses features from multiple full-resolution
local tiles with a down-sampled global view of the image. These local features
are aggregated and fused with global representations for final prediction,
ensuring that native-resolution details are preserved and utilized for
detection. To enhance robustness against challenges such as localized AI
manipulations and compression, we introduce Token-wise Forgery Localization
(TFL) module for fine-grained spatial sensitivity and JPEG Quality Factor
Estimation (QFE) module to disentangle generative artifacts from compression
noise explicitly. Furthermore, to facilitate future research, we introduce
HiRes-50K, a new challenging benchmark consisting of 50,568 images with up to
64 megapixels. Extensive experiments show that HiDA-Net achieves
state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy by over 13% on the challenging Chameleon
dataset and 10% on our HiRes-50K.

Conclusion: BRAIN方法有效解决了脑信号表示偏移和累积偏置问题，同时缓解了灾难性遗忘，为视觉-脑理解任务提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Memory decay makes it harder for the human brain to recognize visual objects
and retain details. Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,
uncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one
of the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we
statistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in
brain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our
findings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,
leading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and
degrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning
(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is
trained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each
learning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also
introduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new
Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned
knowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various
benchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的基于缓存的扩散模型加速方法依赖预定义经验法则或数据集级先验，在动态扩散过程中泛化性有限，对异常样本效果不佳。研究发现浅层特征差异变化模式与最终输出变化高度相关，不同层特征形成相似轨迹。

Method: DiCache包含两个核心组件：1) 在线探针分析方案，利用浅层在线探针实时获取缓存误差稳定先验，自主决定缓存时机；2) 动态缓存轨迹对齐，基于浅层探针特征轨迹组合多步缓存，更好近似当前特征。

Result: 在多种领先扩散模型（WAN 2.1、HunyuanVideo视频生成、Flux图像生成）上的大量实验验证，DiCache相比最先进方法实现了更高效率和更好的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: DiCache通过统一框架解决了"何时缓存"和"如何使用缓存"两个关键问题，无需训练即可自适应加速扩散模型，在保持高质量输出的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques
for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These
studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to
use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level
priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for
leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the
diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on
outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the
variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion
model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the
features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these
observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching
strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and
how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of
two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a
shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in
real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)
Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on
shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current
feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate
DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual
fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models
including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image
generation.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding
performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based
CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical
imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black
boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.
Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains
underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of
integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge
management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz
AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art
explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a
seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack

incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for
outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making
the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes
observability and responsible deployment of computer vision systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM的医疗诊断模型，相比标准RAG方法能显著提升在具有挑战性的医疗图像诊断案例上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗临床决策需要解读医学图像进行诊断，从医学文献和医院记录中检索相关视觉信息可以提高诊断准确性。传统RAG方法中LVLM的错误信号无法传播到检索器，限制了性能。

Method: 开发了一个联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM的模型，仅使用通用骨干网络进行轻量级微调，在医疗多标签分类和视觉问答任务上进行优化。

Result: 模型在医疗多标签分类和视觉问答任务上达到了与医学预训练模型竞争的结果。联合检索优化显著改善了标准RAG在具有挑战性案例上的表现。

Conclusion: 虽然正确诊断经常可以通过top检索图像实现，但实际性能与oracle存在较大差距，前沿LVLM重排序器也无法弥合这一差距，为未来方法留下了改进空间。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology)
for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical
literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this
paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized
with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal
is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only
general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able
to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical
multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel
analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved
images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these
cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval
models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these
challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that
while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top
retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle,
and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room
for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.

underwater scenes by proposing a solution based on deep learning. The proposed
method skillfully integrates two deep convolutional neural network models,
VGG19 and ResNet50, leveraging their powerful feature extraction capabilities
to perform multi-scale and multi-level deep feature analysis of underwater
images. By constructing a unified model, the complementary advantages of the
two models are effectively integrated, achieving a more comprehensive and
accurate image enhancement effect.To objectively evaluate the enhancement
effect, this paper introduces image quality assessment metrics such as PSNR,
UCIQE, and UIQM to quantitatively compare images before and after enhancement
and deeply analyzes the performance of different models in different
scenarios.Furthermore, to improve the practicality and stability of the
underwater visual enhancement system, this paper also provides practical
suggestions from aspects such as model optimization, multi-model fusion, and
hardware selection, aiming to provide strong technical support for visual
enhancement tasks in complex underwater environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCo是一个将人体视频生成解耦为结构生成和外观生成的两阶段方法，通过先产生3D人体运动序列再合成外观，解决了现有方法在全身长距离运动生成中的结构一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型过于注重外观保真度，导致人体运动不真实且物理上不合理，结构连贯性差。现有数据集主要关注面部或上半身运动，限制了生成方法的适用范围。

Method: 提出两阶段解耦方法：首先使用高效的3D结构生成器从文本提示生成人体运动序列，然后在生成的结构序列指导下合成视频外观。引入Human-Aware Dynamic Control模块和改进的密集跟踪约束。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoCo在生成真实且结构连贯的人体视频方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoCo通过结构-外观解耦的方法有效解决了人体视频生成中的运动一致性问题，构建的大规模全身运动数据集为相关研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a
significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion.
Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in
unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural
coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on
facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos,
limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To
overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of
human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance
generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure
generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining
video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated
structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human
structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate
dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the
limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human
video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic
and structurally coherent human videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-BayesSAM是一个高效的贝叶斯SAM框架，通过Token-wise变分贝叶斯推理实现无训练的不确定性估计，并使用自优化KAN网络提升可解释性，在超声图像分割中实现了实时推理、更高精度和关键token识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM在医学图像分割中的三个关键问题：贝叶斯微调的不稳定性、高计算成本以及黑盒设计缺乏可解释性。

Method: 结合Token-wise变分贝叶斯推理(T-VBI)进行高效贝叶斯适应，将输出token重新参数化为潜在变量实现无训练不确定性估计；使用自优化Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(SO-KAN)通过自监督学习改进token预测，提供可解释性并修剪冗余token。

Result: 在五个超声数据集上验证：实现实时推理(0.03秒/图像)、更高的分割精度(剪枝后DSC 89.0% vs 原版88.0% vs MedSAM 88.3%)，并识别出控制SAM决策的四个关键token。

Conclusion: E-BayesSAM统一了效率、可靠性和可解释性，将SAM的多功能性与临床需求相结合，推动了在安全关键医疗应用中的部署。

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image
segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation
remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning
of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM's massive
parameters; (3) SAM's black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome
these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise
Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and
Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving
interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as
dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables
without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty
estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations
via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to
boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets
demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image),
(ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\%
vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four
critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability,
and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs,
advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications. The source code

TL;DR: 该论文分析了视觉数据集中的数据泄露问题，发现所有被分析的数据集都存在某种形式的泄露，且各种类型的泄露都会影响模型评估的可靠性。


<details>

Motivation: 由于大规模数据集通常从互联网获取，而许多计算机视觉基准测试是公开可用的，因此需要研究训练数据中混入评估基准图像的数据泄露现象，以确保模型评估的公平性。

Method: 应用图像检索技术来识别和表征视觉泄露，将泄露分为不同类型（根据模态、覆盖范围和程度）。

Result: 所有被分析的数据集都存在某种形式的泄露，从严重实例到更微妙的情况，所有类型的泄露都会损害下游任务中模型评估的可靠性。

Conclusion: 视觉数据集普遍存在数据泄露问题，这严重影响了模型评估的有效性和公平性，需要引起研究社区的重视并采取相应措施。

Abstract: We analyze data leakage in visual datasets. Data leakage refers to images in
evaluation benchmarks that have been seen during training, compromising fair
model evaluation. Given that large-scale datasets are often sourced from the
internet, where many computer vision benchmarks are publicly available, our
efforts are focused into identifying and studying this phenomenon. We
characterize visual leakage into different types according to its modality,
coverage, and degree. By applying image retrieval techniques, we unequivocally
show that all the analyzed datasets present some form of leakage, and that all
types of leakage, from severe instances to more subtle cases, compromise the
reliability of model evaluation in downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 通过拓扑语义提示和紧凑视觉提示的方法，提出CPE方法来改善视觉-语言模型的零样本分类性能

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在文本提示不完整和视觉提示噪声过多的问题，以改善视觉-语言模型的语义对齐效果

Conclusion: CPE方法通过同时改善文本和视觉提示的质量，显著提升了视觉-语言模型的零样本分类性能

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising
zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to
domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches
primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and
visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual
descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts
and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt
enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing
comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic
perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components:
Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic
Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of
incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates
synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and
constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy
and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual
noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative
regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model,
effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts.
Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual
prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time
adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual
alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于旋转分析的几何最大重叠注册框架，通过将刚体变换分解为沿轴平移和2D注册，使用分支定界法搜索最优旋转参数，并采用扫描线算法高效解决RMQ问题。

Motivation: 解决当前图像基方法需要二次时空复杂度，而多阶段分支定界法容易受到局部最优解影响的问题，需要更高效准确的点云注册方法。

Method: 使用Chasles定理将刚体变换分解为沿轴平移和2D刚体变换；通过分支定界法搜索最优旋转轴和角度；将残差参数求解为范围最大查询问题；采用扫描线算法和线段树高效求解。

Result: 在3DMatch、3DLoMatch和KITTI数据集上表现出超过当前最先进方法的准确性和效率，时间复杂度为多项式，空间复杂度与点数成线性关系。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、准确且可扩展的点云注册方案，能够在高离群比例情况下稳定工作，为计算机视觉和自动驾驶领域提供了有力的工具。

Abstract: Point cloud registration based on correspondences computes the rigid
transformation that maximizes the number of inliers constrained within the
noise threshold. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial
compatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on
registration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at
least quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while
multi-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima
between decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping
registration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation
is decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and
a 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via
BnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems.
Firstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere
parameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated
through interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis.
Secondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D
RMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved
deterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment
tree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time
complexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the
number of points, even in the worst case.

TL;DR: TinySR是一个紧凑高效的扩散模型，专门用于真实图像超分辨率，通过动态块间激活、扩展腐蚀策略、VAE压缩和预缓存技术，在保持感知质量的同时实现实时性能，相比教师模型TSD-SR获得5.68倍加速和83%参数减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在图像超分辨率中虽然能恢复精细细节，但迭代去噪过程计算开销大，难以实时应用。一步蒸馏方法虽然推理更快，但仍受限于大型过参数化模型架构。

Method: 提出动态块间激活和扩展腐蚀策略来促进深度剪枝中的有效决策；通过通道剪枝、注意力移除和轻量级SepConv实现VAE压缩；消除时间和提示相关模块并采用预缓存技术加速模型。

Result: TinySR显著降低了计算成本和模型大小，相比教师模型TSD-SR实现了5.68倍加速和83%参数减少，同时仍能提供高质量结果。

Conclusion: TinySR证明了通过精心设计的压缩策略，可以在保持扩散模型感知质量优势的同时实现实时性能，为实际应用中的高效图像超分辨率提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering
high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex
degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models
(DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative
priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process
incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time
applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and
TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their
large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR,
a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that
achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We
introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy
to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE
compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv.
We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching
techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces
computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83%
parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high
quality results.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在细粒度迭代编辑方面存在不足，包括粒度指令理解、修改过程中的上下文保持以及缺乏智能反馈机制。

Method: 基于LLM的规划能力和LVLM的视觉理解能力构建闭环系统，包括指令解析器、多级编辑规划器、迭代编辑模块和反馈评估循环。

Result: 在包含500张初始图像的新基准测试中，平均得分3.67，显著优于Direct Re-Prompting(2.29)、InstructPix2Pix(2.91)、GLIGEN-based Edit(3.16)和ControlNet-XL(3.39)。

Conclusion: 消融研究、人工评估和分析验证了该智能代理设计在提供卓越编辑保真度和上下文保持方面的有效性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) generation models,
real-world applications often demand fine-grained, iterative image editing that
existing methods struggle to provide. Key challenges include granular
instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications,
and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This
paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent
framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative,
and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual
understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction
parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner
for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative
image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop.
To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new
benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing
instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for
Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and
3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of
iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to
instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in
delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

Conclusion: 该方法在效率、质量和应用广度方面的优异表现，为多视角表面重建和渲染领域做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of neural rendering-based multi-view
surface reconstruction methods, which require an additional mesh extraction
step that is inconvenient and would produce poor-quality surfaces with mesh
aliasing, restricting downstream applications. Building on the explicit mesh
representation and differentiable rasterization framework, this work proposes
an efficient solution that preserves the high efficiency of this framework
while significantly improving reconstruction quality and versatility.
Specifically, we introduce a disentangled geometry and appearance model that
does not rely on deep networks, enhancing learning and broadening
applicability. A neural deformation field is constructed to incorporate global
geometric context, enhancing geometry learning, while a novel regularization
constrains geometric features passed to a neural shader to ensure its accuracy
and boost shading. For appearance, a view-invariant diffuse term is separated
and baked into mesh vertices, further improving rendering efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art training (4.84 minutes) and rendering (0.023 seconds) speeds,
with reconstruction quality that is competitive with top-performing methods.
Moreover, the method enables practical applications such as mesh and texture
editing, showcasing its versatility and application potential. This combination
of efficiency, competitive quality, and broad applicability makes our approach
a valuable contribution to multi-view surface reconstruction and rendering.

Abstract: Inferring the physical properties of 3D scenes from visual information is a
critical yet challenging task for creating interactive and realistic virtual
worlds. While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as
elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene
optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this
problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural
network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual
features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network
can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a
learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic
physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also
collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and
physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is
about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time
optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our
method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever
been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/

Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has
been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been
substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on
limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same
distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object
detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark
with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed
large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator.
Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different
ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within
each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance
features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation
scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality
adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the
impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce
several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for
domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may
propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains. Our

Conclusion: ECVT通过利用LVLM的语义理解能力和多粒度文本提示，显著提升了视频时间结构和事件逻辑的理解能力，在动作识别和定位任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a
formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of
existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal
dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual
features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer
(ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT
employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for
spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The
latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions,
including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal
Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual
cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through
sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic
fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event
graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a
comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal
calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to
understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on
ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3
and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调范式在过度自由和过度限制之间摇摆，导致次优的可塑性-稳定性权衡，需要更精细的调优方法

Method: 分析预训练权重的切空间来测量先验敏感性，探索调优阶段的迁移敏感性，并将这些敏感性作为正则化项融入学习过程

Result: 该方法显著增强了跨模态的可迁移性，在各种多模态跟踪任务中超越了当前最先进技术

Conclusion: 敏感性感知正则化调优框架有效解决了多模态跟踪器优化中的可塑性-稳定性权衡问题，具有优异的性能表现

Abstract: This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modal trackers
by effectively adapting the pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing
fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction,
both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this
dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework,
which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic
parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained
to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal
foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this
issue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights
to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving
generalization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the
tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these
sensitivities as regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the
transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior
performance of the proposed method, surpassing current state-of-the-art
techniques across various multi-modal tracking. The source code and models will
be publicly available at https://github.com/zhiwen-xdu/SRTrack.

Abstract: Human social behaviors are inherently multimodal necessitating the
development of powerful audiovisual models for their perception. In this paper,
we present Social-MAE, our pre-trained audiovisual Masked Autoencoder based on
an extended version of Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked Auto-Encoder (CAV-MAE),
which is pre-trained on audiovisual social data. Specifically, we modify
CAV-MAE to receive a larger number of frames as input and pre-train it on a
large dataset of human social interaction (VoxCeleb2) in a self-supervised

TL;DR: 该研究比较了RadImageNet和ImageNet预训练对医学影像分类任务的影响，发现ResNet50架构和部分解冻策略在ACL撕裂检测和乳腺结节恶性检测中表现最优，但未证实RadImageNet预训练比ImageNet更具优势。


<details>

Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺限制了从头训练模型的效能，迁移学习成为关键解决方案。先前研究发现RadImageNet预训练优于ImageNet，本研究旨在扩展该工作，确定最优CNN架构并统计比较两种预训练方法的效果。

Method: 采用1维卷积分类器、跳跃连接、ResNet50预训练骨干网络和部分骨干网络解冻策略，在ACL撕裂检测和乳腺结节恶性检测任务上进行全面实验和统计分析。

Result: 最佳模型在ACL撕裂检测上达到0.9969 AUC，乳腺结节恶性检测达到0.9641 AUC，与先前研究结果相当甚至更优，但未发现RadImageNet预训练比ImageNet预训练有明显优势的证据。

Conclusion: ResNet50预训练骨干配合部分解冻策略在医学影像分类任务中表现最佳，但RadImageNet预训练并未显示出相对于ImageNet预训练的显著性能提升。

Abstract: Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical
imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical
imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer
learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of
high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that
pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images
(RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to
ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting
a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast
lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing
statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet
pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that
1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50
pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal
downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of
0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy
detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and
surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet
pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast
lesion classification tasks.

Motivation: 军事组织开发高分辨率3D虚拟环境成本高昂，战场条件动态变化使得频繁全规模更新耗时耗资，需要更高效的更新方法

Method: IDU管道包括相机姿态估计对齐新图像、变化检测识别场景修改、3D生成AI创建新资产、人工指导确保精确集成，每次只更新单个新对象

Result: 实验结果表明IDU管道显著减少更新时间和人力，为快速演变的军事场景提供经济高效的有针对性解决方案

Conclusion: 该方法为动态军事环境中的3D模型维护提供了有效的增量更新方案，具有重要的实用价值

Abstract: For simulation and training purposes, military organizations have made
substantial investments in developing high-resolution 3D virtual environments
through extensive imaging and 3D scanning. However, the dynamic nature of
battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes
frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we
introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently
updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with
only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose
estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change
detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is
then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are
seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates
human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement,
with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update
time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining
up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.

TL;DR: HERO是一个针对世界模型的无训练分层加速框架，通过浅层补丁刷新机制和深层线性外推方案，实现1.73倍加速且质量损失最小


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成驱动型世界模型由于扩散模型的迭代性质导致推理速度慢，现有加速技术直接应用于世界模型会导致质量下降

Method: 分层加速策略：浅层使用补丁刷新机制选择需要重新计算的token；深层使用线性外推方案直接估计中间特征，绕过注意力模块和前馈网络计算

Result: 实验显示HERO实现了1.73倍加速，质量退化最小，显著优于现有扩散加速方法

Conclusion: HERO框架有效解决了世界模型推理效率问题，通过利用特征耦合现象实现高质量加速

Abstract: Generation-driven world models create immersive virtual environments but
suffer slow inference due to the iterative nature of diffusion models. While
recent advances have improved diffusion model efficiency, directly applying
these techniques to world models introduces limitations such as quality
degradation. In this paper, we present HERO, a training-free hierarchical
acceleration framework tailored for efficient world models. Owing to the
multi-modal nature of world models, we identify a feature coupling phenomenon,
wherein shallow layers exhibit high temporal variability, while deeper layers
yield more stable feature representations. Motivated by this, HERO adopts
hierarchical strategies to accelerate inference: (i) In shallow layers, a
patch-wise refresh mechanism efficiently selects tokens for recomputation. With
patch-wise sampling and frequency-aware tracking, it avoids extra metric
computation and remain compatible with FlashAttention. (ii) In deeper layers, a
linear extrapolation scheme directly estimates intermediate features. This
completely bypasses the computations in attention modules and feed-forward
networks. Our experiments show that HERO achieves a 1.73$\times$ speedup with
minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion
acceleration methods.

Abstract: Reasoning about fine-grained spatial relationships in warehouse-scale
environments poses a significant challenge for existing vision-language models
(VLMs), which often struggle to comprehend 3D layouts, object arrangements, and
multimodal cues in real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we present
TinyGiantVLM, a lightweight and modular two-stage framework designed for
physical spatial reasoning, distinguishing itself from traditional geographic
reasoning in complex logistics scenes. Our approach encodes both global and
region-level features from RGB and depth modalities using pretrained visual
backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and
diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion
module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support
downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a
two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to
enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized
answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our
64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of
66.8861, demonstrating strong performance in bridging visual perception and
spatial understanding in industrial environments. We further present an
80M-parameter variant with expanded MoE capacity, which demonstrates improved
performance on spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We present HotSpotter, a fast, accurate algorithm for identifying individual
animals against a labeled database. It is not species specific and has been
applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We
describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or
"hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each
database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and
ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance
recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest
neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local
Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category
recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images,
producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query
image in just a few seconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注预测ADAS-Cog总分，但忽略了13个子分数的预测价值，这些子分数反映不同的认知领域，对总分确定具有不同影响力

Method: 使用Vision Transformer作为特征提取器，构建多任务学习框架，系统研究子分数特异性损失加权对模型性能的影响

Result: 提出的加权策略具有群体依赖性：强加权对MRI模式更异质的MCI受试者效果更好，适度加权对变异性较低的CN受试者更有效

Conclusion: 统一加权未充分利用关键子分数并限制泛化能力，提出的框架为基于MRI的AD预后提供了灵活可解释的端到端学习方法

Abstract: Prognostic modeling is essential for forecasting future clinical scores and
enabling early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD). While most existing
methods focus on predicting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the
predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which reflect distinct cognitive
domains. Some sub-scores may exert greater influence on determining global
scores. Assigning higher loss weights to these clinically meaningful sub-scores
can guide the model to focus on more relevant cognitive domains, enhancing both
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we propose a weighted
Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly
predict the ADAS-Cog global score using baseline MRI scans and its 13
sub-scores at Month 24. Our framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and
systematically investigates the impact of sub-score-specific loss weighting on
model performance. Results show that our proposed weighting strategies are
group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with
more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for
CN subjects with lower variability. Our findings suggest that uniform weighting
underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization. The proposed framework
offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end
MRI-based learning. (Github repo link will be provided after review)

Abstract: Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human
body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor
generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose
JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free
Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by
integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional
fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our
approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference
person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through
dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention
layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and
attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person
integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional
generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based
model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off''
model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment
images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing
iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate
that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks
including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong
generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and
prognosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus
on forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive
value of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive
decline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that
jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at
Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and
Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those
associated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score,
an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer
(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are
fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our
results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score
prediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1
(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently
dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential
sub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.
Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,
where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more
complex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved
multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced
learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and
provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD
prediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds remains a major healthcare challenge, with clinical
assessment often relying on subjective and time-consuming manual documentation
methods. Although 2D digital videometry frameworks aided the measurement
process, these approaches struggle with perspective distortion, a limited field
of view, and an inability to capture wound depth, especially in anatomically
complex or curved regions. To overcome these limitations, we present
Wound3DAssist, a practical framework for 3D wound assessment using monocular
consumer-grade videos. Our framework generates accurate 3D models from short
handheld smartphone video recordings, enabling non-contact, automatic
measurements that are view-independent and robust to camera motion. We
integrate 3D reconstruction, wound segmentation, tissue classification, and
periwound analysis into a modular workflow. We evaluate Wound3DAssist across
digital models with known geometry, silicone phantoms, and real patients.
Results show that the framework supports high-quality wound bed visualization,
millimeter-level accuracy, and reliable tissue composition analysis. Full
assessments are completed in under 20 minutes, demonstrating feasibility for
real-world clinical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉特征投影后与文本标记拼接，导致输入序列长度显著增加，计算开销大。现有融合方法往往忽视模型内的分层语义表示和浅层视觉编码层中的细粒度视觉信息。

Method: 通过轻量级分层视觉融合器动态选择和融合分层特征，将融合后的层相关视觉特征投影对齐后直接嵌入到LLM对应层的FFN中，仅微调少量参数。

Result: 在ScienceQA视觉问答和COCO Captions图像描述等多个VL基准测试中，DEHVF比现有参数高效微调基线达到更高准确率，同时保持高效训练和推理。

Conclusion: DEHVF方法有效解决了序列扩展问题，实现了跨模态信息在相同语义粒度上的精确对齐和互补，在保持效率的同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects
visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified
sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads
to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in
substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual
information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence
length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within
the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower
visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an
efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and
fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the
inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and
language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it
dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic
granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The
fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being
directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding
layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also
dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small
number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of
cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted
experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering
on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate
that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and
inference.

Conclusion: HyTver损失函数在多发性硬化症病变分割中表现出色，既能解决数据不平衡问题，又能保持各项指标的均衡性能。

Abstract: Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation is a particularly
challenging problem that involves both input and output imbalance in the data
and segmentation. Therefore in order to develop models that are practical, one
of the solutions is to develop better loss functions. Most models naively use
either Dice loss or Cross-Entropy loss or their combination without too much
consideration. However, one must select an appropriate loss function as the
imbalance can be mitigated by selecting a proper loss function. In order to
solve the imbalance problem, multiple loss functions were proposed that claimed
to solve it. They come with problems of their own which include being too
computationally complex due to hyperparameters as exponents or having
detrimental performance in metrics other than region-based ones. We propose a
novel hybrid loss called HyTver that achieves good segmentation performance
while maintaining performance in other metrics. We achieve a Dice score of
0.659 while also ensuring that the distance-based metrics are comparable to
other popular functions. In addition, we also evaluate the stability of the
loss functions when used on a pre- trained model and perform extensive
comparisons with other popular loss functions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI解决方案缺乏对现实世界农业多样性的泛化能力，通常局限于特定物种，无法在广泛的栽培植物中准确执行

Method: 引入FloraSyntropy Archive数据集(178,922张图像，35种植物，97种病害)；提出FloraSyntropy-Net联邦学习框架，集成Memetic算法选择最优基础模型(DenseNet201)、新颖的Deep Block增强特征表示、客户端克隆策略实现可扩展的隐私保护训练

Conclusion: 该工作不仅提供了宝贵的新资源，还提供了一个强大且高度可泛化的框架，推动该领域向实用的大规模农业AI应用发展

Abstract: Early diagnosis of plant diseases is critical for global food safety, yet
most AI solutions lack the generalization required for real-world agricultural
diversity. These models are typically constrained to specific species, failing
to perform accurately across the broad spectrum of cultivated plants. To
address this gap, we first introduce the FloraSyntropy Archive, a large-scale
dataset of 178,922 images across 35 plant species, annotated with 97 distinct
disease classes. We establish a benchmark by evaluating numerous existing
models on this archive, revealing a significant performance gap. We then
propose FloraSyntropy-Net, a novel federated learning framework (FL) that
integrates a Memetic Algorithm (MAO) for optimal base model selection
(DenseNet201), a novel Deep Block for enhanced feature representation, and a
client-cloning strategy for scalable, privacy-preserving training.
FloraSyntropy-Net achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.38% on the
FloraSyntropy benchmark. Crucially, to validate its generalization capability,
we test the model on the unrelated multiclass Pest dataset, where it
demonstrates exceptional adaptability, achieving 99.84% accuracy. This work
provides not only a valuable new resource but also a robust and highly
generalizable framework that advances the field towards practical, large-scale
agricultural AI applications.

Conclusion: 该研究首次探索了基于点云的管状结构补全，建立了临床数据衍生的数据集，提出的TSRNet方法在管状结构重连方面表现出色，为医学成像和计算机辅助诊断提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Complex tubular structures are essential in medical imaging and
computer-assisted diagnosis, where their integrity enhances anatomical
visualization and lesion detection. However, existing segmentation algorithms
struggle with structural discontinuities, particularly in severe clinical cases
such as coronary artery stenosis and vessel occlusions, which leads to
undesired discontinuity and compromising downstream diagnostic accuracy.
Therefore, it is imperative to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure
their completeness. In this study, we explore the tubular structure completion
based on point cloud for the first time and establish a Point Cloud-based
Coronary Artery Completion (PC-CAC) dataset, which is derived from real
clinical data. This dataset provides a novel benchmark for tubular structure
completion. Additionally, we propose TSRNet, a Tubular Structure Reconnection
Network that integrates a detail-preservated feature extractor, a multiple
dense refinement strategy, and a global-to-local loss function to ensure
accurate reconnection while maintaining structural integrity. Comprehensive
experiments on our PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and
PC-PTR) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, setting a new benchmark for
point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction. Our benchmark is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了M^3-GloDet框架，系统性评估了各种检测模型在多类疾病球镜检测中的性能，发现中等补丁大小和中等放大倍数能提供最佳的性能平衡。

Conclusion: 通过在多类疾病球镜数据集上进行系统比较，该研究提供了对模型优势和局限性的更深入理解，为数字病理学领域自动检测策略和临床工作流的精炼提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is fundamental to progress in renal
pathology and underpins the delivery of reliable clinical diagnoses. Although
recent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated
detection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal
glomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of
diseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not
without consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological
characteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the
most advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the
choice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for
fine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of
accurate classification and robust segmentation.
  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed
to enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of
regions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both
long-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art
models that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design
that reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions
encountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that
intermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and
efficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by
reducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a
multi-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the
understanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable
insights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical
workflows in the digital pathology domain.

Result: 在TimeChat和LLaVA-Video上实现65%计算量减少，性能保持97-99%。在QVHighlights上HIT@1提升9.5%，Charades-STA上R@1保持99.6%

Conclusion: LGTTP是模型无关的高效框架，特别擅长处理具有明确时间标记的查询，在通用视频理解任务中表现优异

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) struggle with long-form videos due to the
quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. We propose Language-Guided
Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to
adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing
computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP
retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our
model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a
65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original
performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on
Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit
temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding
tasks.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an essential component
of medical imaging research, aiming to increase transparency and clinical trust
in deep learning models. This study investigates brain hemorrhage diagnosis
with a focus on explainability through Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
techniques. A pipeline was developed to extract pixellevel segmentation and
detection annotations from classification models using nine state-of-the-art
CAM algorithms, applied across multiple network stages, and quantitatively
evaluated on the Hemorica dataset, which uniquely provides both slice-level
labels and high-quality segmentation masks. Metrics including Dice, IoU, and
pixel-wise overlap were employed to benchmark CAM variants. Results show that
the strongest localization performance occurred at stage 5 of EfficientNetV2S,
with HiResCAM yielding the highest bounding-box alignment and AblationCAM
achieving the best pixel-level Dice (0.57) and IoU (0.40), representing strong
accuracy given that models were trained solely for classification without
segmentation supervision. To the best of current knowledge, this is among the f
irst works to quantitatively compare CAM methods for brain hemorrhage
detection, establishing a reproducible benchmark and underscoring the potential
of XAI-driven pipelines for clinically meaningful AI-assisted diagnosis.

Method: 提出CATformer网络，采用双分支架构：主分支使用扩散启发的Transformer逐步细化潜在表示，辅助分支通过学习的潜在对比增强噪声鲁棒性，最后使用残差密集块进行特征融合和重建。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CATformer在效率和视觉图像质量方面均优于最近的基于Transformer和扩散启发的方法。

Conclusion: CATformer成功弥合了基于Transformer、扩散和GAN的方法之间的性能差距，为扩散启发Transformer在超分辨率中的实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Super-resolution remains a promising technique to enhance the quality of
low-resolution images. This study introduces CATformer (Contrastive Adversarial
Transformer), a novel neural network integrating diffusion-inspired feature
refinement with adversarial and contrastive learning. CATformer employs a
dual-branch architecture combining a primary diffusion-inspired transformer,
which progressively refines latent representations, with an auxiliary
transformer branch designed to enhance robustness to noise through learned
latent contrasts. These complementary representations are fused and decoded
using deep Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks for enhanced reconstruction
quality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CATformer
outperforms recent transformer-based and diffusion-inspired methods both in
efficiency and visual image quality. This work bridges the performance gap
among transformer-, diffusion-, and GAN-based methods, laying a foundation for
practical applications of diffusion-inspired transformers in super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法在动态服装重建中存在两个主要问题：隐式表示方法无法建模高频细节，模板重建方法使用顶点位移导致伪影。需要一种能同时处理复杂动态和高质量细节重建的方法。

Method: 提出神经梯度变形(NGD)方法，结合自适应网格重划分策略来建模动态演化的表面细节(如皱纹和褶皱)，并学习动态纹理贴图来捕捉每帧的光照和阴影效果。

Result: 通过广泛的定性和定量评估，证明该方法在动态服装重建质量上显著优于现有最先进方法，能够生成高质量的服装重建结果。

Conclusion: NGD方法成功解决了动态服装重建中的关键挑战，通过神经梯度变形和自适应网格技术实现了对复杂动态和高频细节的高质量重建。

Abstract: Dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular video is an important yet
challenging task due to the complex dynamics and unconstrained nature of the
garments. Recent advancements in neural rendering have enabled high-quality
geometric reconstruction with image/video supervision. However, implicit
representation methods that use volume rendering often provide smooth geometry
and fail to model high-frequency details. While template reconstruction methods
model explicit geometry, they use vertex displacement for deformation, which
results in artifacts. Addressing these limitations, we propose NGD, a Neural
Gradient-based Deformation method to reconstruct dynamically evolving textured
garments from monocular videos. Additionally, we propose a novel adaptive
remeshing strategy for modelling dynamically evolving surfaces like wrinkles
and pleats of the skirt, leading to high-quality reconstruction. Finally, we
learn dynamic texture maps to capture per-frame lighting and shadow effects. We
provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate
significant improvements over existing SOTA methods and provide high-quality
garment reconstructions.

Abstract: Traditional dialogue retrieval aims to select the most appropriate utterance
or image from recent dialogue history. However, they often fail to meet users'
actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across
long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment
Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments,
comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As
a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue
retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each
naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in
real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising
real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on
these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image
fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,
these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within
retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval
model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject
fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning
with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and
contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally
dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum
sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and
gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in
long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain
and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.

Abstract: Human Action Anomaly Detection (HAAD) aims to identify anomalous actions
given only normal action data during training. Existing methods typically
follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each
action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder
scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is
often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these
limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with
few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation
space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a
given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve
inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a
generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation
model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy
specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive
experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art
effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings,
regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear
tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination
is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning
framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to
enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly
available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The
impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing
the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented
images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally
improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and
F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced
classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the
results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be
limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical
applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

Conclusion: CMFDNet通过创新的模块设计有效解决了结肠息肉分割中的关键挑战，在多个基准数据集上取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Automated colonic polyp segmentation is crucial for assisting doctors in
screening of precancerous polyps and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms.
Although existing methods have achieved promising results, polyp segmentation
remains hindered by the following limitations,including: (1) significant
variation in polyp shapes and sizes, (2) indistinct boundaries between polyps
and adjacent tissues, and (3) small-sized polyps are easily overlooked during
the segmentation process. Driven by these practical difficulties, an innovative
architecture, CMFDNet, is proposed with the CMD module, MSA module, and FD
module. The CMD module, serving as an innovative decoder, introduces a
cross-scanning method to reduce blurry boundaries. The MSA module adopts a
multi-branch parallel structure to enhance the recognition ability for polyps
with diverse geometries and scale distributions. The FD module establishes
dependencies among all decoder features to alleviate the under-detection of
polyps with small-scale features. Experimental results show that CMFDNet
outperforms six SOTA methods used for comparison, especially on ETIS and
ColonDB datasets, where mDice scores exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% and
1.55%, respectively.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but
existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint
detection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due
to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these
challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint
detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the
keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and
compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a
gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss
function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built
new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our
method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method
achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing
methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss
function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally,
improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For
3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of
0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and
reliability. The code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 随着CLIP预训练模型被广泛用于下游任务，需要深入分析其迁移性影响，特别是这些模型记录在案的社会偏见和人类刻板印象如何传播到视觉问答、图像描述等下游应用中。

Method: 通过全面的实证分析：1) 检查预训练偏见在数据全局和局部视图间的变化；2) 分析不同预训练偏见水平下预训练模型与下游任务偏见的相关性；3) 探索偏见不一致的原因，研究当前范式下不同预训练CLIP模型在下游任务适应时的表征空间收敛情况。

Result: 研究发现：偏见测量高度依赖于计算时所使用的数据子集；预训练偏见与下游任务偏见之间难以发现一致的趋势；不同预训练CLIP模型在下游任务适应时表征空间趋于收敛，这解释了偏见不一致的现象。

Conclusion: 这项工作为偏见行为提供了有价值的见解，并为未来研究促进更好的偏见缓解实践提供了信息，强调了当前偏见转移研究中的不一致性和复杂性。

Abstract: The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as
backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis
of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented
reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases,
learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual
question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all?
  We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior
literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how
pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that
bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is
computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained
models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias,
finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally,
we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current
paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge
when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights
into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias
mitigation practices.

Conclusion: CEIDM通过双重控制机制有效解决了复杂实体和交互关系的生成问题，在文本到图像生成任务中表现出优越的性能，为精细化图像生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their
intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on
diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to
produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image
generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and
interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining
approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich
implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion
models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and
have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an
interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the
interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing
global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and
detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of
the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with
more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network
which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging
multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network
to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves
image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than
the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their
interaction control.

Motivation: 工业环境中训练数据常包含错误标签样本，传统异常检测方法在此类噪声条件下性能显著下降，需要开发鲁棒的检测框架

Method: 采用双层优化策略：元学习快速适应不同噪声条件，不确定性量化指导自适应L2正则化；结合预训练特征提取器进行多尺度特征处理，利用归一化流进行精确似然估计

Result: 在MVTec-AD和KSDD2数据集上分别达到95.4%和94.6%的I-AUROC分数（干净条件），50%错误标签下仍保持86.8%和92.1%的鲁棒检测能力

Conclusion: RAD框架对噪声训练条件具有卓越的鲁棒性，能够检测各种工业场景中的细微异常，是实际应用中数据标注不完美时的实用解决方案

Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational
efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face
significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common
occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly
detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial
settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where
meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while
uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model
stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through
pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation
capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive
evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,
achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean
conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and
92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight
RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to
detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a
practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect
data curation is challenging.

Motivation: 当前流行的细胞分割网络（如Cellpose、Stardist、HoverNet等）虽然准确度高，但依赖完全标注的数据集，这严重限制了训练集的生成和迁移学习的应用

Method: 提出了一种仍然基于距离映射但能够处理部分标注对象的方法，该方法被嵌入到用户友好的Napari插件中

Conclusion: 该方法在不牺牲分割质量的前提下，有效解决了完全标注数据集的限制问题，为细胞分割提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: The most popular networks used for cell segmentation (e.g. Cellpose,
Stardist, HoverNet,...) rely on a prediction of a distance map. It yields
unprecedented accuracy but hinges on fully annotated datasets. This is a
serious limitation to generate training sets and perform transfer learning. In
this paper, we propose a method that still relies on the distance map and
handles partially annotated objects. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed approach in the contexts of frugal learning, transfer learning and
regular learning on regular databases. Our experiments show that it can lead to
substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation
quality. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a user-friendly Napari plugin.

TL;DR: 提出位置重加权视觉token剪枝方法，通过调整视觉token的空间位置权重来缓解序列模型的近因偏差，提升视觉token剪枝效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中存在近因偏差，导致图像底部区域的视觉token获得过高的注意力分数，使得剪枝算法不均衡地保留底部token，影响剪枝效果

Method: 提出位置重加权机制，根据视觉token在图像中的空间位置调整其注意力分数，该方法无需改变模型架构或额外训练，可直接集成到现有视觉token剪枝框架中

Result: 在LVLMs上的大量实验表明，该方法以最小的计算开销显著提升了视觉token剪枝的性能

Conclusion: 位置重加权视觉token剪枝是一种简单有效的插件式解决方案，能够有效缓解近因偏差问题，提高视觉token剪枝的质量和效率

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number
of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in
visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the
computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The
text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token
pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.
However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing
later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's
output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens
corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning
that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we
present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency
bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting
mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their
spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual
Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model
architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal
computational overhead.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了视频融合中的时序一致性问题，为视频多模态融合提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Existing multi-modal fusion methods typically apply static frame-based image
fusion techniques directly to video fusion tasks, neglecting inherent temporal
dependencies and leading to inconsistent results across frames. To address this
limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly
incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to
simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal
consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module
consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19
employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both
the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video
degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a
temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to
facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we
embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss
to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative
evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal
consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on
public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data
scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving
manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a
novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident
learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike
traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method
assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary
information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework
quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model
uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where
normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation.
Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical
domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on
texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and
pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates
dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable
for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

Motivation: 现有3D室内场景生成方法在粗尺度家具布局方面有进展，但在细粒度物体摆放方面表现不佳，限制了生成环境的真实性和实用性，影响了虚拟现实体验和具身AI应用的场景理解

Method: HLG采用分层布局生成方法，包括细粒度布局对齐模块（通过垂直和水平解耦构建分层布局）和可训练的布局优化网络（解决位置、朝向错误和物体交叉等问题）

Result: 通过大量实验证明该方法在生成真实室内场景方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了场景生成领域，为需要详细3D环境的应用开辟了新可能性，将发布代码以促进未来研究

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior
design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods
have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to
capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of
generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and
detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these
issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for
fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine
hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture
placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained
layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and
horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into
multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization
network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation
errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically
plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating
realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the
field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications
requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication
to encourage future research.

Result: 在新建的RefTextCOD数据集上实验表明，该方法超越现有半监督方法，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: SCOUT方法通过有效利用未标注数据和文本信息，显著提升了半监督伪装目标检测的性能，为该领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The difficulty of pixel-level annotation has significantly hindered the
development of the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) field. To save on
annotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework
that relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled
data. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the
effective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a
Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive
Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection
(ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable
data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The
TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining
camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this
work, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD
field and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released at

Conclusion: DiffAug框架通过文本引导的扩散生成和自动验证机制，有效解决了医学图像中罕见异常分割的数据稀缺问题，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to
scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that
combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation
validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent
diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to
synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples
undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network
that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The
text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse
abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism
filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while
operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three
medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over
baselines and reduces false negative rates by up to 28% for challenging cases

Motivation: 虽然预训练视觉语言模型具有出色的零样本泛化能力，但提示调优的泛化能力仍然有限。标签平滑作为有效的正则化技术可以防止模型过拟合，但传统标签平滑反而会削弱提示调优的泛化能力。

Method: 提出交替训练标签平滑(ATLaS)方法，交替使用标准one-hot标签和标签平滑生成的软标签来监督提示调优。引入两种高效离线软标签：类间软标签(CSL)和实例-类软标签(ISL)，为提示调优提供类间或实例-类关系。

Result: 大量实验表明，ATLaS方法结合CSL和ISL能够一致提升提示调优的泛化性能。该方法与主流提示调优方法具有高度兼容性，可以无缝集成到现有方法中。

Conclusion: ATLaS方法有效解决了传统标签平滑在提示调优中的局限性，通过交替训练策略和高效软标签设计显著提升了提示调优的泛化能力，具有良好的实用性和兼容性。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these
models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the
generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing
(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that
prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.
This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,
we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of
prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based
Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot
labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.
Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including
Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide
inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical
properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL,
consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning.
Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent
prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

<details>

Motivation: 深度目标检测器训练需要昂贵的边界框标注，主动学习可以减轻标注负担。在目标检测的框级主动学习中，早期模型只能在多数类别上表现良好，导致伪标签严重类别不平衡。

Result: 在公共基准数据集上评估，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过解决类别不平衡问题和提高伪标签质量，有效提升了目标检测主动学习的性能。

Abstract: Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation.
Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation
burden. Performing AL at box-level for object detection, i.e., selecting the
most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image
with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and
labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe
that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making
the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced
sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling,
so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL
and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose
a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo
labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有相机位姿优化方法需要为不同描述符重建场景或为每个场景重新训练网络，而基于特征相似性的方法缺乏几何约束导致精度不足。

Method: 使用现有3DGS模型渲染新视角图像，在查询图像与多个渲染图像间建立极几何约束，通过迭代优化方法精化相机位姿，可灵活选择特征提取器和匹配器。

Conclusion: GS-SMC框架提供了一种轻量级、无需额外训练的相机位姿优化解决方案，通过结合3DGS渲染和几何约束实现了优异的精度提升。

Abstract: Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose
estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches
rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks,
requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully
retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose
from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less
accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose
refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as
GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing
3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be
directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines
the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and
multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature
extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical
evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches,
achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors
on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.

Conclusion: ISALux通过有效整合光照和语义先验，在低光照图像增强任务中表现出色，为解决过拟合问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: We introduce ISALux, a novel transformer-based approach for Low-Light Image
Enhancement (LLIE) that seamlessly integrates illumination and semantic priors.
Our architecture includes an original self-attention block, Hybrid Illumination
and Semantics-Aware Multi-Headed Self- Attention (HISA-MSA), which integrates
illumination and semantic segmentation maps for en- hanced feature extraction.
ISALux employs two self-attention modules to independently process illumination
and semantic features, selectively enriching each other to regulate luminance
and high- light structural variations in real-world scenarios. A Mixture of
Experts (MoE)-based Feed-Forward Network (FFN) enhances contextual learning,
with a gating mechanism conditionally activating the top K experts for
specialized processing. To address overfitting in LLIE methods caused by
distinct light patterns in benchmarking datasets, we enhance the HISA-MSA
module with low-rank matrix adaptations (LoRA). Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations across multiple specialized datasets demonstrate that
ISALux is competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Addition- ally, an
ablation study highlights the contribution of each component in the proposed

Motivation: 现有的自动提示优化方法主要针对纯文本输入，在多模态任务（如视频-语言生成）中存在视觉标记膨胀和缺乏过程级监督两个核心挑战，限制了提示优化的效果。

Method: 采用EM风格的优化过程，将反馈建模和提示优化解耦；引入短期-长期记忆机制：历史反馈缓解上下文限制，历史提示提供方向性指导。

Result: 在文本、图像和视频基准测试中均取得一致性的性能提升，建立了高效且可迁移的提示优化统一框架。

Conclusion: UniAPO是首个专门为多模态自动提示优化设计的框架，通过创新的优化策略有效解决了多模态环境下的核心挑战，为多模态提示优化提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompting is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of large language
models. To automate and enhance this process, automatic prompt optimization
(APO) has been developed, demonstrating effectiveness primarily in text-only
input scenarios. However, extending existing APO methods to multimodal tasks,
such as video-language generation introduces two core challenges: (i) visual
token inflation, where long visual token sequences restrict context capacity
and result in insufficient feedback signals; (ii) a lack of process-level
supervision, as existing methods focus on outcome-level supervision and
overlook intermediate supervision, limiting prompt optimization. We present
UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization, the first framework
tailored for multimodal APO. UniAPO adopts an EM-inspired optimization process
that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement, making the optimization
more stable and goal-driven. To further address the aforementioned challenges,
we introduce a short-long term memory mechanism: historical feedback mitigates
context limitations, while historical prompts provide directional guidance for
effective prompt optimization. UniAPO achieves consistent gains across text,
image, and video benchmarks, establishing a unified framework for efficient and
transferable prompt optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单目深度估计技术在手术环境中由于光照变化和复杂纹理而表现有限，而基于自然图像训练的基础模型在应用到内窥镜领域时存在领域适应性限制和语义感知缺陷。

Method: 提出了EndoUFM框架，整合双基础模型利用预学习先验；采用随机向量低秩适应(RVLoRA)进行自适应微调；使用基于深度可分离卷积的残差块(Res-DSC)捕捉局部特征；设计掩码引导平滑度损失确保组织结构的深度一致性。

Conclusion: 这项工作有助于增强外科医生在微创手术中的空间感知，从而提高手术精度和安全性，对增强现实和导航系统具有重要影响。

Abstract: Depth estimation is a foundational component for 3D reconstruction in
minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, existing monocular depth
estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying
illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful
visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural
images leads to significant domain adaptability limitations and semantic
perception deficiencies when applied to endoscopy. In this study, we introduce
EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively
integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth
estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The
framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates
Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a
Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve
the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a
mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical
tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and
EndoNeRF datasets confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
while maintaining an efficient model size. This work contributes to augmenting
surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, thereby
enhancing surgical precision and safety, with crucial implications for
augmented reality and navigation systems.

Abstract: Progress in remote PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (rPPG) is limited by the critical
issues of existing publicly available datasets: small size, privacy concerns
with facial videos, and lack of diversity in conditions. The paper introduces a
novel comprehensive large-scale multi-view video dataset for rPPG and health
biomarkers estimation. Our dataset comprises 3600 synchronized video recordings

analysis of physiological states, each recording is paired with a 100 Hz PPG
signal and extended health metrics, such as electrocardiogram, arterial blood
pressure, biomarkers, temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and
stress level. Using this data, we train an efficient rPPG model and compare its
quality with existing approaches in cross-dataset scenarios. The public release
of our dataset and model should significantly speed up the progress in the
development of AI medical assistants.

Motivation: 探索如何将体积上下文信息融入CT扫描伪影减少任务中，以提升模型性能，特别关注不同光束几何形状和输入数据维度的影响

Method: 使用22个临床CT扫描，通过Astra工具箱模拟平行、扇形和锥形光束的稀疏采样CT体积。训练和验证2D和3D U-Net模型，比较2D、2.5D和3D数据维度的性能

Result: 对于所有光束几何形状，在轴向2D切片上训练的2D U-Net获得了最佳的MSE和SSIM值，优于2.5D和3D输入数据维度

Conclusion: 在CT稀疏采样伪影校正任务中，2D U-Net使用轴向切片比使用包含体积上下文信息的2.5D或3D数据表现更好

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effect of various beam geometries and
dimensions of input data on the sparse-sampling streak artifact correction task
with U-Nets for clinical CT scans as a means of incorporating the volumetric
context into artifact reduction tasks to improve model performance. A total of
22 subjects were retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) from the Technical
University of Munich's research hospital, TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar.
Sparsely-sampled CT volumes were simulated with the Astra toolbox for parallel,
fan, and cone beam geometries. 2048 views were taken as full-view scans. 2D and
3D U-Nets were trained and validated on 14, and tested on 8 subjects,
respectively. For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT
images, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D',
and 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data
refers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut
through the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were
rearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance
was assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index
measure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices
results in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input
data dimensions.

TL;DR: SAIL-Recon是一个基于Transformer的前馈网络，通过增强场景回归网络的视觉定位能力来解决大规模结构光运动(SfM)问题，能够高效处理大量输入图像并在相机姿态估计和新视角合成方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的场景回归方法（如VGGT）在处理极端视角变化的图像时表现优异，但无法有效处理大量输入图像。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够扩展到大规模场景的方法。

Method: 首先从锚点图像子集计算神经场景表示，然后对回归网络进行微调，使其能够基于该神经场景表示重建所有输入图像。采用前馈Transformer架构，结合视觉定位能力。

Result: 在TUM-RGBD、CO3Dv2和Tanks & Temples等多个基准测试中，该方法不仅能够高效扩展到大规模场景，还在相机姿态估计和新视角合成方面取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SAIL-Recon通过引入神经场景表示和视觉定位增强，成功解决了大规模SfM问题，为场景回归方法在处理大量图像时的扩展性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Scene regression methods, such as VGGT, solve the Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
problem by directly regressing camera poses and 3D scene structures from input
images. They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under
extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large
number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a
feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene
regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our
method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor
images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input
images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive
experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale
scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose
estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and
Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are

Abstract: The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which
safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous
driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection
under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing
structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However,
challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce
data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety
violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision
architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road
environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode
framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a
five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved
the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road
images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better
road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.

Conclusion: 通过将先进的多模态推理与成熟的法医方法相结合，确保语义提案通过具体技术证据得到系统验证和增强，实现了全面的检测准确性和定位精度

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of image manipulation techniques demands robust
forensic solutions that can both reliably detect alterations and precisely
localize tampered regions. Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show
promise by leveraging world knowledge and semantic understanding for
context-aware detection, yet they struggle with perceiving subtle, low-level
forensic artifacts crucial for accurate manipulation localization. This paper
presents a novel Propose-Rectify framework that effectively bridges semantic
reasoning with forensic-specific analysis. In the proposal stage, our approach
utilizes a forensic-adapted LLaVA model to generate initial manipulation
analysis and preliminary localization of suspicious regions based on semantic
understanding and contextual reasoning. In the rectification stage, we
introduce a Forensics Rectification Module that systematically validates and
refines these initial proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis,
integrating technical evidence from several specialized filters. Additionally,
we present an Enhanced Segmentation Module that incorporates critical forensic
cues into SAM's encoded image embeddings, thereby overcoming inherent semantic
biases to achieve precise delineation of manipulated regions. By
synergistically combining advanced multimodal reasoning with established
forensic methodologies, our framework ensures that initial semantic proposals
are systematically validated and enhanced through concrete technical evidence,
resulting in comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization
capabilities.

Motivation: 完全无监督异常检测(FUAD)在实际应用中更具实用性，但传统知识蒸馏方法在训练数据包含异常时会学习到异常表示，导致检测性能下降

Method: 提出跨域蒸馏(CDD)框架：1)域特定训练-将训练集划分为多个低异常比域并训练域特定学生；2)跨域知识聚合-利用伪正常特征协作指导全局学生学习跨样本的通用正常表示

Result: 在带噪声的MVTec AD和VisA数据集上实验表明，该方法相比基线取得显著性能提升

Conclusion: CDD框架有效解决了FUAD设置下知识蒸馏的异常学习问题，验证了在完全无监督异常检测场景中的有效性

Abstract: Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (FUAD) is a practical extension of
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD), aiming to detect anomalies without any
labels even when the training set may contain anomalous samples. To achieve
FUAD, we pioneer the introduction of Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigm based
on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the
presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk
enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under
FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To
address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD)
framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm.
Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training
set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific
student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where
pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively
guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all
samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance
improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD
setting.

Conclusion: 首次使用2D X射线作为颅骨表示进行颅面重建，为法医鉴定提供了新的有效解决方案

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensics is one of the processes to identify
victims of crime and natural disasters. Identifying an individual from their
remains plays a crucial role when all other identification methods fail.
Traditional methods for this task, such as clay-based craniofacial
reconstruction, require expert domain knowledge and are a time-consuming
process. At the same time, other probabilistic generative models like the
statistical shape model or the Basel face model fail to capture the skull and
face cross-domain attributes. Looking at these limitations, we propose a
generic framework for craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-ray images. Here,
we used various generative models (i.e., CycleGANs, cGANs, etc) and fine-tune
the generator and discriminator parts to generate more realistic images in two
distinct domains, which are the skull and face of an individual. This is the
first time where 2D X-rays are being used as a representation of the skull by
generative models for craniofacial reconstruction. We have evaluated the
quality of generated faces using FID, IS, and SSIM scores. Finally, we have
proposed a retrieval framework where the query is the generated face image and
the gallery is the database of real faces. By experimental results, we have
found that this can be an effective tool for forensic science.

Conclusion: Visual-CoG通过引入阶段感知奖励机制和多阶段推理框架，有效提升了文本生成图像模型处理复杂提示的能力，为多模态生成任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in
text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and
ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works
have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and
employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation
stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which
stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal
policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance
(Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process
refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate
guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a
visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on
GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%,
5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the
proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) poses a significant challenge due to
the intrinsic high similarity between targets and backgrounds, demanding models
capable of profound holistic understanding beyond superficial cues. Prevailing
methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning
mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of
cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and
imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed
Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive
scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought
framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning
within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three
cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive
prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic
maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background
disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning
and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling
precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting:
Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating
cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative
point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny.
Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical
Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional
efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for
comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object
categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses
significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS)
offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images
are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with
vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often
relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this
paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free
open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp,
a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details
from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any
task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias
Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch
features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components
empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained
VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the
framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images,
where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce
AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer
semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the
need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS
across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR
datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the
SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and
open-world Earth observation.

TL;DR: EventTracer是一个基于路径追踪的渲染流水线，能够从复杂3D场景高效模拟高保真事件序列，通过低SPP路径追踪加速渲染，并使用轻量级脉冲网络去噪生成逼真事件数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件流模拟方法通常使用无噪声RGB帧，渲染成本高且时间分辨率低（100-300 FPS），远低于真实事件数据。需要一种高效、物理感知的方法来生成大规模、高时间分辨率的事件数据。

Method: 采用低样本每像素（SPP）路径追踪加速渲染过程，训练轻量级事件脉冲网络（配备双极性泄漏积分发放单元和双向地球移动距离损失）将RGB视频去噪为真实事件序列。

Result: EventTracer流水线以约4分钟/秒720p视频的速度运行，继承了路径追踪的精确时空建模优势，在细节捕捉和与真实事件数据相似性方面优于其他模拟器。

Conclusion: EventTracer是创建大规模事件-RGB数据集的有前景工具，能够缩小事件视觉的模拟-现实差距，推动机器人、自动驾驶和VR/AR等应用场景发展。

Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in
event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high
temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or
undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction
typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and
therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300
FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose
EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates
high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and
physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low
sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking
network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To
capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with
a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a
bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at
a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit
of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in
two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and
demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event
simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale
event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based
vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and VRAR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种原型学习和聚类方法，用于在少样本环境下发现高光谱图像中的未知类别，不仅能区分已知和未知类别，还能进一步识别未知类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的开集高光谱图像分类方法主要关注从已知类别中区分和拒绝未知类别样本，但无法进一步识别或发现未知类别中的具体类别结构。

Method: 使用原型学习方法，通过少量标注样本推断未知类别的原型，在已知类别分类器拒绝未知类别样本后，根据样本与推断出的未知类别原型的距离进行聚类分析。

Result: 在四个基准高光谱图像数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在开集少样本高光谱图像分类任务中表现出具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效发现和识别高光谱图像中的未知类别，为开集少样本分类问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify
image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be
classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the
open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on
distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and
rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples.
They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the
samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for
discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few
labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes
of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes.
Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class
classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples
into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown
class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive
experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
exhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

Result: 实验证明所提方法显著有效，不仅加速和稳定了SB模型的训练，还进一步提升了SGM的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为生成模型的未来研究做出了贡献并铺平了道路，成功统一了两种重要生成模型框架。

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as
Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three
reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM),
Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional
Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize
the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel
initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train
SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of
both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models
and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed
methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future
research on generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉引导图像编辑评估过于简单，无法充分代表真实世界的编辑挑战，特别是模型可能出现的幻觉问题。

Method: 开发了SpotEdit基准测试，涵盖扩散模型、自回归模型和混合生成模型，包含专门的幻觉评估组件来检测模型错误执行编辑任务的情况。

Result: 揭示了不同生成模型之间存在显著的性能差异，发现像GPT-4o这样的领先模型经常出现幻觉，错误地执行编辑任务。

Conclusion: SpotEdit提供了一个全面的评估框架，有助于更好地理解和改进视觉引导图像编辑模型的性能，特别是在防止幻觉方面。

Abstract: Visually-guided image editing, where edits are conditioned on both visual
cues and textual prompts, has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-grained,
controllable content generation. Although recent generative models have shown
remarkable capabilities, existing evaluations remain simple and insufficiently
representative of real-world editing challenges. We present SpotEdit, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess visually-guided image
editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative
models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical
yet underexplored challenge, our benchmark includes a dedicated component on
hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often
hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing
task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素级标注耗时且需要专家，而粗标注更快速廉价，即使是非专家也能制作，但存在噪声问题

Method: 使用两个耦合CNN从纯噪声粗标注中学习真实分割标签分布，通过高保真度实现网络分离，并添加互补标签学习来估计负标签分布

Result: 在MNIST玩具数据集、Cityscapes多类分割数据集和视网膜医学图像上均优于最先进方法，特别是在粗标注比例较小时表现更佳

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用噪声粗标注训练高质量分割模型，降低了标注成本和时间，在医学影像等领域具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but
pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce
expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse
annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts.
In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target)
and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We
present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from
purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the
two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training
annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages
estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our
method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present
the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets:
Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical
applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is
small compared to the given dense annotations.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量后处理或产生低质量重建，需要一种能够直接生成高质量几何并确保合理手-物交互的重建方法

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型，以修复后的物体外观为条件，通过速度场监督和手-物变换同时优化，结合多模态几何线索（法线深度对齐、轮廓一致性、关键点重投影）和符号距离场监督，强制接触和非相交约束

Result: 在遮挡情况下产生准确、鲁棒和一致的重建结果，在野外场景中泛化良好

Conclusion: 该方法通过扩散过程中的推理时指导和优化循环设计，实现了高质量的手持物体3D重建，确保了物理合理的手-物交互

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry
of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object
interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion
model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to
optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible
hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive
post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly
generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by
introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we
guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while
simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object
being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues,
including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint
reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and
enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical
plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and
coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild
scenarios.

TL;DR: GM-Skip是一个用于Transformer块跳过的灵活框架，通过度量引导的贪婪选择和反向删除机制，在保持输出质量的同时加速视觉语言模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型虽然性能优异，但计算成本高昂，阻碍了在自动驾驶等延迟敏感应用中的部署。需要一种方法在保持性能的同时加速推理。

Method: 采用贪婪的度量引导块选择策略，使用度量反馈（如准确率、CIDEr）识别冗余层，结合反向顺序删除机制保留早期基础块以避免性能崩溃，并通过分数-稀疏度平衡目标实现可调节的性能与稀疏度权衡。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，GM-Skip将Person类别的单目标分类准确率从19.1%提升至87.3%，同时跳过超过40%的Transformer块。在自动驾驶系统中实现高达45.4%的延迟减少。

Conclusion: GM-Skip框架能有效加速视觉语言模型的推理速度，同时保持任务性能，在真实世界部署中验证了其实用价值，特别适用于延迟敏感的应用场景。

Abstract: Transformer-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive
performance on tasks such as image captioning, object recognition, and visual
reasoning, but their high computational cost hinders deployment in
latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. We introduce GM-Skip, a
flexible and metric-adaptive framework for Transformer block skipping that
accelerates VLM inference while preserving output quality. GM-Skip features a
greedy, metric-guided block selection strategy that uses metric feedback (e.g.,
accuracy, CIDEr) to identify redundant layers, along with a reverse-order
deletion mechanism that preserves early foundational blocks to avoid
performance collapse. To support diverse deployment needs, it incorporates a
tunable trade-off between sparsity and performance via a score-sparsity balance
objective. Experiments across multiple tasks and datasets, including COCO and
CODA, show that GM-Skip consistently improves inference speed while maintaining
task performance. On the COCO dataset, GM-Skip improves single-object
classification accuracy on the Person category from 19.1 percent to 87.3
percent while skipping more than 40 percent of Transformer blocks. In
real-world deployment, it achieves up to 45.4 percent latency reduction on
single-object detection when integrated into an autonomous vehicle running
Autoware.Universe, validating the effectiveness of its skip configurations and
confirming its practical value in accelerating real-world inference.

Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型容易受到后门攻击，攻击者可以通过注入不可见的文本触发器来操纵模型输出。虽然分类模型中的文本后门防御已有研究，但生成模型缺乏有效的缓解技术。

Method: 提出SKD-CAG方法，利用知识蒸馏和跨注意力机制，指导模型修正对中毒提示的响应，同时在无触发器时保持清洁输出，在注意力层面消除后门影响。

Result: 实验表明该方法优于现有方法，像素后门移除准确率达100%，风格攻击移除准确率达93%，且不牺牲鲁棒性或图像保真度。

Conclusion: 选择性遗忘是保护生成模型安全的有前景的防御策略，SKD-CAG方法为文本到图像扩散模型提供了有效的后门防御解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their
vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. Adversaries
can inject imperceptible textual triggers into training data, causing models to
generate manipulated outputs. Although text-based backdoor defenses in
classification models are well-explored, generative models lack effective
mitigation techniques against. We address this by selectively erasing the
model's learned associations between adversarial text triggers and poisoned
outputs, while preserving overall generation quality. Our approach,
Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG), uses
knowledge distillation to guide the model in correcting responses to poisoned
prompts while maintaining image quality by exploiting the fact that the
backdoored model still produces clean outputs in the absence of triggers. Using
the cross-attention mechanism, SKD-CAG neutralizes backdoor influences at the
attention level, ensuring the targeted removal of adversarial effects.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches,
achieving removal accuracy 100\% for pixel backdoors and 93\% for style-based
attacks, without sacrificing robustness or image fidelity. Our findings
highlight targeted unlearning as a promising defense to secure generative
models. Code and model weights can be found at

TL;DR: LanSE是一个新的AI生成内容评估架构，通过识别可解释的视觉模式并用自然语言描述，提供细粒度的评估指标，解决了现有评估方法过于粗糙的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 当前AI生成内容（如合成图像）的质量评估指标过于粗糙，无法识别具体优缺点，限制了模型选择和科学理解，需要更细粒度的评估方法。

Method: 提出Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE)架构，通过大规模人工评估（超过11,000个标注）和多模态模型分析，识别可解释的视觉模式并自动用自然语言描述。

Result: LanSE在自然图像中检测可解释视觉模式的准确率超过93%，能够量化生成质量的四个关键维度：提示匹配、视觉真实性、物理合理性和内容多样性，揭示了现有指标无法发现的模型细微差异。

Conclusion: LanSE通过将可解释性与实际评估需求相结合，为生成AI模型的用户提供了强大的工具，用于模型选择、合成内容质量控制和模型改进，直接解决了公众对AI生成内容的信心和安全需求。

Abstract: While the quality of AI-generated contents, such as synthetic images, has
become remarkably high, current evaluation metrics provide only coarse-grained
assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses that
researchers and practitioners need for model selection and development, further
limiting the scientific understanding and commercial deployment of these
generative models. To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse
Encoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation
metrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically
describing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more
than 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE
demonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in
synthetic images with more than 93\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further
provides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key
dimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical
plausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences
invisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical
plausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with
human judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs,
LanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model
selection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement. These
capabilities directly address the need for public confidence and safety in
AI-generated content, both critical for the future of generative AI
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高精度、高效率的3D姿态估计，适用于嵌入式平台和低功耗设备，为实际应用提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lightweight Transformer-based lifter that maps
short sequences of human 2D joint positions to 3D poses using a single camera.
The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths
and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and
uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to
ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single
versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully
calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without
calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with
corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and
intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete
priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results
show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that
the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available,
and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D
joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state
of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed,
the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it
suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.

Conclusion: GSVisLoc证明了3DGS表示在视觉定位任务中的有效性，提供了一种无需修改场景表示即可实现准确相机定位的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a
query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We
accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene
features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image
features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in
three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by
applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our
method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization
without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We
evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive
localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing
3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel
scenes without additional training.

Conclusion: 多模态覆盖准则是有效的token选择方法，能在保持VLMs性能的同时显著提升推理效率

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in
understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual
input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the
degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been
proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only
unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent
multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic
criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this
limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to
select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first
formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.
Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and
the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be
adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision
pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark
datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text
information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass
the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage
criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while
maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore,
with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original
performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of
coverage in token selection.

TL;DR: InternVL 3.5是一个开源多模态模型系列，通过级联强化学习框架和动态视觉分辨率路由技术，在推理能力和推理效率方面显著提升，相比前代模型性能提升16%，推理速度提升4.05倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态模型在推理能力、推理效率和部署灵活性方面的挑战，开发一个既能保持高性能又能实现高效推理的开源多模态模型。

Method: 采用级联强化学习框架（离线RL+在线RL两阶段训练）、视觉分辨率路由器（ViR）动态调整视觉token分辨率、解耦视觉-语言部署策略（DvD）分离视觉编码器和语言模型到不同GPU。

Result: 在MMMU和MathVista等下游推理任务上取得显著提升，总体推理性能提升16%，推理速度提升4.05倍，在开源MLLM中达到最先进水平，接近GPT-5等商业模型的性能。

Conclusion: InternVL 3.5通过创新的训练框架和部署策略，成功实现了多模态模型性能与效率的双重突破，为开源社区提供了强大的多模态基础模型，并支持GUI交互和具身智能等新能力。

Abstract: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that
significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference
efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade
Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through
a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for
refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial
improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To
optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that
dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising
performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)
strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,
effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively
enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning
performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor,
i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as
GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e.,
InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs
across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the
performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code
are publicly released.

TL;DR: ObjFiller-3D提出了一种基于视频编辑模型的3D修复方法，通过将3D场景转换为视频序列来解决多视角不一致性问题，相比现有方法在重建质量和细节保真度上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D修复方法依赖多视角2D图像修复，但不同视角间的修复结果存在不一致性，导致纹理模糊、空间不连续和视觉伪影，影响3D对象完成的质量和真实感。

Method: 使用先进的视频编辑模型替代传统2D图像修复模型，分析3D与视频之间的表示差距，将视频修复模型适配到3D场景修复，并引入基于参考的3D修复方法来进一步提升重建质量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，ObjFiller-3D相比之前的方法产生了更忠实和精细的重建结果（PSNR 26.6 vs NeRFiller 15.9，LPIPS 0.19 vs Instant3dit 0.25）。

Conclusion: 该方法在3D编辑应用中展现出强大的实际部署潜力，能够生成高质量且一致的3D对象完成和编辑结果。

Abstract: 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the
inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred
textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These
inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and
realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high
fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of
high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D
image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of
state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D
objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose
an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition,
we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the
quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that
compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and
fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of
0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for
practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications. Project page:

Motivation: 尽管深度学习在语音不流畅检测方面取得进展，但临床应用中可解释性和透明度至关重要，基于规则的方法仍有重要价值。

Method: 提出增强的基于规则框架，包含语速归一化、多级声学特征分析和分层决策结构，整合UCLASS、FluencyBank和SEP-28k等多个语料库的见解。

Result: 在延长音检测上达到97-99%的准确率，在不同语速下保持稳定性能，可作为现代机器学习流程的提案生成器或约束模块。

Conclusion: 基于规则的方法在临床环境中具有独特优势，特别是在决策可审计性、患者特定调优和实时反馈方面，虽然神经网络在无约束环境下可能获得略高准确率。

Abstract: Stuttering affects approximately 1% of the global population, impacting
communication and quality of life. While recent advances in deep learning have
pushed the boundaries of automatic speech dysfluency detection, rule-based
approaches remain crucial for clinical applications where interpretability and
transparency are paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of
rule-based stuttering detection systems, synthesizing insights from multiple
corpora including UCLASS, FluencyBank, and SEP-28k. We propose an enhanced
rule-based framework that incorporates speaking-rate normalization, multi-level
acoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures. Our approach
achieves competitive performance while maintaining complete
interpretability-critical for clinical adoption. We demonstrate that rule-based
systems excel particularly in prolongation detection (97-99% accuracy) and
provide stable performance across varying speaking rates. Furthermore, we show
how these interpretable models can be integrated with modern machine learning
pipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules, bridging the gap
between traditional speech pathology practices and contemporary AI systems. Our
analysis reveals that while neural approaches may achieve marginally higher
accuracy in unconstrained settings, rule-based methods offer unique advantages
in clinical contexts where decision auditability, patient-specific tuning, and
real-time feedback are essential.

Abstract: Understanding the factors that shape students' mathematics performance is
vital for designing effective educational policies. This study applies
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to PISA 2018 data to
predict math achievement and identify key predictors across ten countries
(67,329 students). We tested four models: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),
Random Forest (RF), CATBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), using
student, family, and school variables. Models were trained on 70% of the data
(with 5-fold cross-validation) and tested on 30%, stratified by country.
Performance was assessed with R^2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To ensure
interpretability, we used feature importance, SHAP values, and decision tree
visualizations. Non-linear models, especially RF and ANN, outperformed MLR,
with RF balancing accuracy and generalizability. Key predictors included
socio-economic status, study time, teacher motivation, and students' attitudes
toward mathematics, though their impact varied across countries. Visual
diagnostics such as scatterplots of predicted vs actual scores showed RF and
CATBoost aligned closely with actual performance. Findings highlight the
non-linear and context-dependent nature of achievement and the value of XAI in
educational research. This study uncovers cross-national patterns, informs
equity-focused reforms, and supports the development of personalized learning
strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对ICD编码模型的可解释性进行了全面评估，提出了基于忠实度和合理性的评估框架，构建了新的标注数据集，并利用LLM生成解释来提升模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在ICD编码方面虽然准确率高，但缺乏可解释性，影响了临床应用的信任度。现有解释方法主要依赖注意力机制和定性评估，缺乏系统性评估和专门训练的解释生成方法。

Method: 1) 从忠实度和合理性两个维度评估解释质量；2) 构建新的高质量标注数据集；3) 使用LLM生成解释作为远程监督信号；4) 提出新的解释学习方法，结合少量人工标注样本进一步提升效果。

Result: LLM生成的解释与人类专家判断最为接近，结合少量人工标注样本不仅能改善解释生成质量，还能提升解释学习方法的效果。

Conclusion: LLM生成的解释在ICD编码任务中表现出良好的合理性，通过结合少量人工标注可以进一步提升解释质量，为临床编码模型的可解释性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated clinical coding involves mapping unstructured text from Electronic
Health Records (EHRs) to standardized code systems such as the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD). While recent advances in deep learning have
significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ICD coding, the lack of
explainability in these models remains a major limitation, undermining trust
and transparency. Current explorations about explainability largely rely on
attention-based techniques and qualitative assessments by physicians, yet lack
systematic evaluation using consistent criteria on high-quality rationale
datasets, as well as dedicated approaches explicitly trained to generate
rationales for further enhancing explanation. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding
through two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations
reflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how
consistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the
evaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,
offering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with
current clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of
rationales of ICD coding. Encouraged by the promising plausibility of
LLM-generated rationales for ICD coding, we further propose new rationale
learning methods to improve the quality of model-generated rationales, where
rationales produced by prompting LLMs with/without annotation examples are used
as distant supervision signals. We empirically find that LLM-generated
rationales align most closely with those of human experts. Moreover,
incorporating few-shot human-annotated examples not only further improves
rationale generation but also enhances rationale-learning approaches.

Motivation: 现有的GPU加速学习环境只提供固定游戏的硬编码实现，缺乏灵活性。PuzzleJAX旨在支持动态编译任意游戏，覆盖更广泛、更具表达力的人类相关任务空间。

Method: 基于流行的PuzzleScript在线游戏引擎设计领域特定语言（DSL），支持动态游戏编译。验证了数百个自2013年以来由专业设计师和休闲创作者设计的游戏。

Result: PuzzleJAX能够自然表达既简单直观又极具挑战性的任务，需要控制、规划和高层次洞察力的结合。

Conclusion: PuzzleJAX提供了一个扩展性强、表达力丰富的基准测试平台，能够有效评估搜索、学习和语言模型在复杂益智游戏中的表现。

Abstract: We introduce PuzzleJAX, a GPU-accelerated puzzle game engine and description
language designed to support rapid benchmarking of tree search, reinforcement
learning, and LLM reasoning abilities. Unlike existing GPU-accelerated learning
environments that provide hard-coded implementations of fixed sets of games,
PuzzleJAX allows dynamic compilation of any game expressible in its
domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL follows PuzzleScript, which is a
popular and accessible online game engine for designing puzzle games. In this
paper, we validate in PuzzleJAX several hundred of the thousands of games
designed in PuzzleScript by both professional designers and casual creators
since its release in 2013, thereby demonstrating PuzzleJAX's coverage of an
expansive, expressive, and human-relevant space of tasks. By analyzing the
performance of search, learning, and language models on these games, we show
that PuzzleJAX can naturally express tasks that are both simple and intuitive
to understand, yet often deeply challenging to master, requiring a combination
of control, planning, and high-level insight.

Method: Spacer系统包含：(1)Nuri灵感引擎：从18万篇生物学论文构建的关键词图中提取新颖高潜力关键词集；(2)显化管道：连接关键词、分析逻辑结构、验证合理性，最终起草原创科学概念。

Result: Nuri评估指标AUROC得分0.737准确分类高影响力论文；显化管道成功从关键词集重建顶级期刊文章核心概念（85%以上重建质量良好）；Spacer输出与领先论文的相似度显著高于SOTA LLM。

Conclusion: Spacer系统通过刻意去语境化方法有效实现了自动化科学发现，能够生成具有创造性和事实基础的科学概念，在科学发现自动化方面展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have made automated scientific research the next
frontline in the path to artificial superintelligence. However, these systems
are bound either to tasks of narrow scope or the limited creative capabilities
of LLMs. We propose Spacer, a scientific discovery system that develops
creative and factually grounded concepts without external intervention. Spacer
attempts to achieve this via 'deliberate decontextualization,' an approach that
disassembles information into atomic units - keywords - and draws creativity
from unexplored connections between them. Spacer consists of (i) Nuri, an
inspiration engine that builds keyword sets, and (ii) the Manifesting Pipeline
that refines these sets into elaborate scientific statements. Nuri extracts
novel, high-potential keyword sets from a keyword graph built with 180,000
academic publications in biological fields. The Manifesting Pipeline finds
links between keywords, analyzes their logical structure, validates their
plausibility, and ultimately drafts original scientific concepts. According to
our experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies
high-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline
also successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal
articles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates
that this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases. Finally, our
embedding space analysis shows that outputs from Spacer are significantly more
similar to leading publications compared with those from SOTA LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种医疗健康领域的实用框架，利用单一视觉-语言模型（VLM）在两种补充角色中实现流程优化和任务处理，解决了传统切片化工作流的效率低下和运营成本高问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床工作流很零碎，通常由多个脚本和任务特定网络组成，这些管道很少为数据科学流程进行优化，导致效率低下和运营成本增加。工作流还缺乏数据驱动的模型识别和标准化的模型输出交付。

Method: 提出了两种解决方案：1）VLM作为知情模型卡片匹配器，通过三阶段工作流（模态→主要异常→模型卡ID）将入来图像路由到适当的专业模型；2）在专业特定数据集上对VLM进行微调，确保单个模型覆盖每个专业内的多个下游任务。每个阶段都有提示语允许提前退出，并通过前2名选择器降低错误选择的概率。

Result: 在消化内科、血液学、眼科学和病理学领域，单模型部署的性能可以达到或接近专业基线模型的水平。与由多个任务特定代理组成的管道相比，这种方法显示了一个VLM既能决策又能执行。

Conclusion: 该方法可能减少数据科学家的工作量，缩短监控时间，提高模型选择的透明度（通过每阶段理由），并降低集成费用。这为医疗健康领域提供了一种更高效、更简化的模型部署方案。

Abstract: Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific
networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These
pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency
and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model
identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model
outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that
uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First
(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an
incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow
(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)
stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a
stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each
stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow
with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on
specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream
tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying
deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,
our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.
  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach
shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data
scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection
(with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.

*Katherine Atwell,Pedram Heydari,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出使用贝叶斯框架来量化LLM中的奉承行为，通过测量与理性行为的偏差来区分理性与非理性更新，解决了传统方法在无真实标签任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奉承行为量化方法主要关注行为变化或准确率影响，但无法表征理性变化，且准确率方法仅适用于有真实标签的场景。需要一种能处理不确定性任务和无真实标签情况的奉承行为量化框架。

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架，将奉承行为定义为面对用户观点时与理性行为的偏差。研究3个不同任务、开源和闭源LLM组合、两种奉承探测方法，并实验多种概率判断激发方法。

Result: 发现：1）LLM不具备贝叶斯理性；2）奉承探测导致预测后验概率显著偏向引导结果；3）奉承有时增加贝叶斯误差，少数情况下反而减少误差；4）奉承引起的贝叶斯误差变化与Brier分数相关性不强。

Conclusion: 仅研究奉承对真实标签的影响不能完全捕捉推理错误，贝叶斯框架能更全面地表征奉承行为，特别是在不确定性和无真实标签场景中。

Abstract: Sycophancy, or overly agreeable or flattering behavior, is a documented issue
in large language models (LLMs), and is critical to understand in the context
of human/AI collaboration. Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by
measuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric
characterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in
scenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian
framework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when
presented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and
irrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In
comparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive
behavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not
have a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination
of open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing
sycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability
judgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause
deviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian
error. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2)
probing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted
posterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in
increased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases
error, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly
correlated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on
ground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to
sycophancy.

Abstract: Data visualizations like charts are fundamental tools for quantitative
analysis and decision-making across fields, requiring accurate interpretation
and mathematical reasoning. The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) offers promising capabilities for automated visual data analysis, such
as processing charts, answering questions, and generating summaries. However,
they provide no visibility into which parts of the visual data informed their
conclusions; this black-box nature poses significant challenges to real-world
trust and adoption. In this paper, we take the first major step towards
evaluating and enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs to attribute their reasoning
process by highlighting the specific regions in charts and graphs that justify
model answers. To this end, we contribute RADAR, a semi-automatic approach to
obtain a benchmark dataset comprising 17,819 diverse samples with charts,
questions, reasoning steps, and attribution annotations. We also introduce a
method that provides attribution for chart-based mathematical reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our reasoning-guided approach improves
attribution accuracy by 15% compared to baseline methods, and enhanced
attribution capabilities translate to stronger answer generation, achieving an
average BERTScore of $\sim$ 0.90, indicating high alignment with ground truth
responses. This advancement represents a significant step toward more
interpretable and trustworthy chart analysis systems, enabling users to verify
and understand model decisions through reasoning and attribution.

  We investigate the complexity of computational problems related to infinite
but finitary argumentations frameworks, that is, infinite AFs where each
argument is attacked by only finitely many others. Our results reveal a
surprising scenario. On one hand, we see that the assumption of being finitary
does not automatically guarantee a drop in complexity. However, for the
admissibility-based semantics, we find a remarkable combinatorial constraint
which entails a dramatic decrease in complexity.
  We conclude that for many forms of reasoning, the finitary infinite AFs
provide a natural setting for reasoning which balances well the competing goals
of being expressive enough to be applied to many reasoning settings while being
computationally tractable enough for the analysis within the framework to be
useful.

TL;DR: 提出了Generate-and-Split (GaS)框架，将强化学习与最优分割算法结合，解决多旅行商问题中的最小化最长路径问题，显著优于现有学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的两阶段方法将学习组件与经典求解器分离，破坏了优化的一致性，可能导致解质量下降。需要一种能够联合优化的框架。

Method: 提出GaS框架，整合强化学习和最优分割算法进行联合训练。分割算法在欧几里得空间中保证最优分割，并具有近线性可扩展性。采用LSTM增强模型架构处理部分可观测性。

Result: 大量实验表明，GaS框架在解质量和可迁移性方面显著优于现有的基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: GaS框架通过联合训练强化学习和分割算法，有效解决了传统两阶段方法的优化不一致问题，为多旅行商问题提供了高质量的近似解决方案。

Abstract: This study addresses the Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem
($m^3$-TSP), which aims to coordinate tours for multiple salesmen such that the
length of the longest tour is minimized. Due to its NP-hard nature, exact
solvers become impractical under the assumption that $P \ne NP$. As a result,
learning-based approaches have gained traction for their ability to rapidly
generate high-quality approximate solutions. Among these, two-stage methods
combine learning-based components with classical solvers, simplifying the
learning objective. However, this decoupling often disrupts consistent
optimization, potentially degrading solution quality. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage framework named \textbf{Generate-and-Split} (GaS),
which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with an optimal splitting
algorithm in a joint training process. The splitting algorithm offers
near-linear scalability with respect to the number of cities and guarantees
optimal splitting in Euclidean space for any given path. To facilitate the
joint optimization of the RL component with the algorithm, we adopt an
LSTM-enhanced model architecture to address partial observability. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed GaS framework significantly outperforms
existing learning-based approaches in both solution quality and
transferability.

Conclusion: PowerChain系统成功解决了配电电网分析自动化的挑战，为缺乏研发资源的小型电力公司提供了可扩展的先进分析解决方案。

Abstract: Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution
grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating
advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience.
State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models,
functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are
challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a
large R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To
address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve
unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language
models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain
dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware
functions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function
pool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query
pairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with
both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks
operating on real utility data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人类中心AI和价值决策研究存在不足，需要深入理解系统如何融入人类价值、人类如何识别系统价值，以及如何最小化伤害风险。

Method: 通过理论分析，提出价值对齐应超越静态单一概念，强调长期推理和适应性，并建议采用多智能体框架处理价值多元化和冲突。

Result: 识别了价值对齐面临的挑战，并指出了推进价值对齐研究的方向，包括从设计方法到实际应用的多元视角。

Conclusion: 价值对齐需要更全面的理论来涵盖人类价值的全谱系，多智能体系统为处理价值多元化、冲突和智能体间价值推理提供了合适框架。

Abstract: The concepts of ``human-centered AI'' and ``value-based decision'' have
gained significant attention in both research and industry. However, many
critical aspects remain underexplored and require further investigation. In
particular, there is a need to understand how systems incorporate human values,
how humans can identify these values within systems, and how to minimize the
risks of harm or unintended consequences. In this paper, we highlight the need
to rethink how we frame value alignment and assert that value alignment should
move beyond static and singular conceptions of values. We argue that AI systems
should implement long-term reasoning and remain adaptable to evolving values.
Furthermore, value alignment requires more theories to address the full
spectrum of human values. Since values often vary among individuals or groups,
multi-agent systems provide the right framework for navigating pluralism,
conflict, and inter-agent reasoning about values. We identify the challenges
associated with value alignment and indicate directions for advancing value
alignment research. In addition, we broadly discuss diverse perspectives of
value alignment, from design methodologies to practical applications.

TL;DR: 提出了MaRVL-QA基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型在数学曲面图上的深度数学和空间推理能力，发现当前最先进模型表现不佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在语义描述方面已很成功，但在深度数学和空间推理方面仍有不足，需要专门的基准测试来评估这些核心推理技能

Method: 创建MaRVL-QA基准，包含两个新任务：拓扑计数（识别和枚举局部极值等特征）和变换识别（识别几何变换），使用经过严格模糊性筛选的函数库生成数据

Result: 即使是最先进的多模态大语言模型也表现不佳，往往依赖表面启发式方法而非稳健的空间推理

Conclusion: MaRVL-QA为研究社区提供了一个具有挑战性的新工具，可用于衡量进展、暴露模型局限性，并指导开发具有更深层次推理能力的多模态大语言模型

Abstract: A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to
perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving
beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface
plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task
of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure
progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over
Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these
core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological
Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and
Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations.
Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity
filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs
struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of
robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the
research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the
development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM框架能够有效自动化论文海报生成过程，结合专业设计原则和VLM评估方法，可以产生既语义准确又视觉吸引人的高质量海报。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in tackling complex compositional tasks. In this work,
we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical
yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences.
While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core
design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial
manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a
multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster
designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and
Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2)
Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist
agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4)
Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that
are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design
quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures
layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show
that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly
outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are
presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在具身导航中缺乏结构化的空间记忆，只能被动反应，限制了在复杂真实环境中的泛化能力和适应性。

Method: BSC-Nav框架从自我中心轨迹和上下文线索构建异中心认知地图，动态检索与语义目标对齐的空间知识，并与强大的多模态大语言模型集成。

Conclusion: BSC-Nav提供了一个可扩展且基于生物学基础的路径，为实现通用空间智能提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Spatial cognition enables adaptive goal-directed behavior by constructing
internal models of space. Robust biological systems consolidate spatial
knowledge into three interconnected forms: \textit{landmarks} for salient cues,
\textit{route knowledge} for movement trajectories, and \textit{survey
knowledge} for map-like representations. While recent advances in multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have enabled visual-language reasoning in
embodied agents, these efforts lack structured spatial memory and instead
operate reactively, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex
real-world environments. Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for
Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging
structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric
cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and
dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated
with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency
across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization,
and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering
a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial
intelligence.

Abstract: This paper presents the first integrated systematic study on the performance
of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to automatically
formulate and solve stochastic optimiza- tion problems from natural language
descriptions. Focusing on three key categories, joint chance- constrained
models, individual chance-constrained models, and two-stage stochastic linear
programs (SLP-2), we design several prompts that guide ChatGPT through
structured tasks using chain-of- thought and modular reasoning. We introduce a
novel soft scoring metric that evaluates the struc- tural quality and partial
correctness of generated models, addressing the limitations of canonical and
execution-based accuracy. Across a diverse set of stochastic problems,
GPT-4-Turbo outperforms other models in partial score, variable matching, and
objective accuracy, with cot_s_instructions and agentic emerging as the most
effective prompting strategies. Our findings reveal that with well-engineered
prompts and multi-agent collaboration, LLMs can facilitate specially stochastic
formulations, paving the way for intelligent, language-driven modeling
pipelines in stochastic opti- mization.

(HAM-D), causally influence the prescription of SSRIs versus SNRIs. Methods: We
applied explainable counterfactual reasoning with counterfactual explanations
(CFs) to assess the impact of specific symptom changes on antidepressant
choice. Results: Among 17 binary classifiers, Random Forest achieved highest
performance (accuracy, F1, precision, recall, ROC-AUC near 0.85). Sample-based
CFs revealed both local and global feature importance of individual symptoms in
medication selection. Conclusions: Counterfactual reasoning elucidates which
MDD symptoms most strongly drive SSRI versus SNRI selection, enhancing
interpretability of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Future work
should validate these findings on more diverse cohorts and refine algorithms
for clinical deployment.

Conclusion: 该设计将离线策略转化为一个连续的、由临床医生监督的系统，具有清晰的控制机制和快速适应能力。

Abstract: Clinical decision support must adapt online under safety constraints. We
present an online adaptive tool where reinforcement learning provides the
policy, a patient digital twin provides the environment, and treatment effect
defines the reward. The system initializes a batch-constrained policy from
retrospective data and then runs a streaming loop that selects actions, checks
safety, and queries experts only when uncertainty is high. Uncertainty comes
from a compact ensemble of five Q-networks via the coefficient of variation of
action values with a $\tanh$ compression. The digital twin updates the patient
state with a bounded residual rule. The outcome model estimates immediate
clinical effect, and the reward is the treatment effect relative to a
conservative reference with a fixed z-score normalization from the training
split. Online updates operate on recent data with short runs and exponential
moving averages. A rule-based safety gate enforces vital ranges and
contraindications before any action is applied. Experiments in a synthetic
clinical simulator show low latency, stable throughput, a low expert query rate
at fixed safety, and improved return against standard value-based baselines.
The design turns an offline policy into a continuous, clinician-supervised
system with clear controls and fast adaptation.

Method: 使用可解释的基于规则的代理模型近似黑盒模型，生成对抗样本，并通过因果依赖关系优化成本计算，只考虑用户主动改变的特征

Result: MC3G相比现有技术提供更可解释和可操作的对抗建议，同时具有更低的成本

Conclusion: MC3G有潜力增强机器学习决策过程的透明度、问责制和实际效用

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes
settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent,
interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help
understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the
underlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many
practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency
with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers
actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.
Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by
showing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We
propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a
novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual
methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model
using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used
to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original
underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding
the ``effort" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to
causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides
a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a
favourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and
actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all
while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G's potential to enhance
transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making
processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.

Abstract: Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in
critical industries such as healthcare, fin-tech and cybersecurity have led to
a surge in research in explainability in AI. Innovative research methods are
being explored to extract meaningful insight from blackbox AI systems to make
the decision-making technology transparent and interpretable. Explainability
becomes all the more critical when AI is used in decision making in domains
like fintech, healthcare and safety critical systems such as cybersecurity and
autonomous vehicles. However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the
reliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the
explanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the
blackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a
framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision
making. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations
(LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms
to provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of
IDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on
a specific input. Whereas, the global explanations provides the list of
significant features and their relationship with attack traffic. In addition,
this framework brings transparency in the field of ML driven IDS that might be
highly significant for wide scale adoption of eXplainable AI in cyber-critical
systems. Our framework is able to achieve 85 percent accuracy in classifying
attack behaviour on UNSW-NB15 dataset, while at the same time displaying the
feature significance ranking of the top 10 features used in the classification.

Abstract: Extended reality technologies are transforming fields such as healthcare,
entertainment, and education, with Smart Eye-Wears (SEWs) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) playing a crucial role. However, SEWs face inherent
limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life, while offloading
computations to external servers is constrained by network conditions and
server workload variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, enabling multiple agents to
train collaboratively while preserving data privacy. We implemented synchronous
and asynchronous federation strategies, where models are aggregated either at
fixed intervals or dynamically based on agent progress. Experimental results
show that federated agents exhibit significantly lower performance variability,
ensuring greater stability and reliability. These findings underscore the
potential of FRL for applications requiring robust real-time AI processing,
such as real-time object detection in SEWs.

lies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual
input, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake
content. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset,
which consists of both segmented and full-length video clips. Unlike previous
benchmarks, which focused primarily on isolated segments, the DDL-AV dataset
allows us to assess the model's performance in a more comprehensive and
realistic setting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this
dataset, outperforming existing techniques in terms of both accuracy and
processing speed. The ERF-BA-TFD+ model demonstrated its effectiveness in the
"Workshop on Deepfake Detection, Localization, and Interpretability," Track 2:
Audio-Visual Detection and Localization (DDL-AV), and won first place in this
competition.

Method: 基于认知科学原理，将推理过程分解为对象级和元级组件，构建级联框架实现主动规划、在线调节和自适应早停。

Result: 在三个挑战性基准测试中，Meta-R1性能提升达27.3%，token消耗减少至15.7%~32.7%，效率提升达14.8%，并在不同数据集和模型骨干上保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: Meta-R1成功为大型推理模型赋予了显式元认知能力，解决了现有模型的局限性，实现了高性能、高效率和强可迁移性的推理系统。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
tasks, exhibiting emergent, human-like thinking patterns. Despite their
advances, we identify a fundamental limitation: current LRMs lack a dedicated
meta-level cognitive system-an essential faculty in human cognition that
enables "thinking about thinking". This absence leaves their emergent abilities
uncontrollable (non-adaptive reasoning), unreliable (intermediate error), and
inflexible (lack of a clear methodology). To address this gap, we introduce
Meta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit
metacognitive capabilities. Drawing on principles from cognitive science,
Meta-R1 decomposes the reasoning process into distinct object-level and
meta-level components, orchestrating proactive planning, online regulation, and
adaptive early stopping within a cascaded framework. Experiments on three
challenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that
Meta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to
27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and
improving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts;
and (III) transferable, maintaining robust performance across datasets and
model backbones.

Method: 提出计算多智能体社会实验框架，结合生成式智能体建模和虚拟民族志方法，通过三个研究来观察智能体在语言互动中的行为模式。

Result: 智能体表现出独立于预设身份的内生立场，对不同话语策略有独特的语调偏好和响应模式，能够主动瓦解基于身份的权力结构并重构自组织的社区边界。

Conclusion: 预设身份不会刚性决定智能体的社会结构，人类研究者需要关注智能体语言网络的内生机制和互动动态，这为使用生成式AI建模群体社会动力学和研究人机协作提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Large language models have been widely used to simulate credible human social
behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate
stable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex
interactions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a
computational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates
generative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to
investigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation
emerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that
agents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and
display distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse
strategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively
dismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct
self-organized community boundaries based on these stances. Our findings
suggest that preset identities do not rigidly determine the agents' social
structures. For human researchers to effectively intervene in collective
cognition, attention must be paid to the endogenous mechanisms and
interactional dynamics within the agents' language networks. These insights
provide a theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group
social dynamics and studying human-agent collaboration.

Motivation: 当前基于符号回归或大语言模型的方法仅限于单模态数据，忽略了丰富的视觉运动表征，这种"感官剥夺"严重削弱了理解动态现象中时空模式的能力。

Method: 采用运动结构归纳课程训练，通过监督微调解释运动相图，构建因果思维链指导的假设，然后通过奖励引导的符号校准用强化学习优化公式结构。推理时先提出高置信度符号假设，再调用外部符号回归工具进行符号残差重对齐。

Conclusion: VIPER-R1通过整合视觉感知和符号推理，成功模拟了科学发现过程，为从多模态观测数据中自动发现物理定律提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated discovery of physical laws from observational data in the real
world is a grand challenge in AI. Current methods, relying on symbolic
regression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual
phenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to
physicists. This "sensory deprivation" severely weakens their ability to
interpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To
address this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual
Induction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic
formulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic
reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via
a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning
to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a
Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration
(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During
inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a
high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic
regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final
step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the
theoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce
PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that
VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy
and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws. Project

Motivation: 研究LLMs在结构化数据上的函数逼近能力，探索其在分类、回归和聚类任务中的表现，为商业智能和探索性分析提供快速低开销的替代方案。

Method: 评估最先进LLMs（GPT-5、GPT-4o等）在少样本提示下的性能，并与传统机器学习基线（线性模型、集成方法、表格基础模型）进行比较，分析上下文大小和提示结构对预测质量的影响。

Result: LLMs在有限数据条件下分类任务表现强劲，但回归任务性能较差（相比ML模型），聚类结果有限，归因于缺乏真正的上下文学习能力。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为结构化数据的通用预测引擎，在分类方面有明显优势，但在回归和聚类方面存在显著局限性，适合快速数据探索和商业智能应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), originally developed for natural language
processing (NLP), have demonstrated the potential to generalize across
modalities and domains. With their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, LLMs
can perform predictive tasks over structured inputs without explicit
fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the empirical
function approximation capability of LLMs on small-scale structured datasets
for classification, regression and clustering tasks. We evaluate the
performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash,
DeepSeek-R1) under few-shot prompting and compare them against established
machine learning (ML) baselines, including linear models, ensemble methods and
tabular foundation models (TFMs). Our results show that LLMs achieve strong
performance in classification tasks under limited data availability,
establishing practical zero-training baselines. In contrast, the performance in
regression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, likely
because regression demands outputs in a large (often infinite) space, and
clustering results are similarly limited, which we attribute to the absence of
genuine ICL in this setting. Nonetheless, this approach enables rapid,
low-overhead data exploration and offers a viable alternative to traditional ML
pipelines in business intelligence and exploratory analytics contexts. We
further analyze the influence of context size and prompt structure on
approximation quality, identifying trade-offs that affect predictive
performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs can serve as general-purpose
predictive engines for structured data, with clear strengths in classification
and significant limitations in regression and clustering.

Motivation: 当前约束随机最短路径问题(CSSP)的启发式搜索算法需要求解一系列线性规划问题，计算效率较低。需要开发更高效的算法来处理具有概率效应和成本约束的最短路径问题。

Method: 提出CARL算法，将CSSP转化为一系列无约束随机最短路径问题(SSP)，使用标量化方法将多维成本投影到标量成本，采用类似次梯度法的优化算法寻找最优标量化参数。

Result: 实验表明CARL算法在现有基准测试中比最先进方法多解决50%的问题，表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: CARL算法通过创新的标量化和优化方法，有效解决了约束随机最短路径问题，显著提升了求解效率和成功率。

Abstract: Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (CSSPs) model problems with
probabilistic effects, where a primary cost is minimised subject to constraints
over secondary costs, e.g., minimise time subject to monetary budget. Current
heuristic search algorithms for CSSPs solve a sequence of increasingly larger
CSSPs as linear programs until an optimal solution for the original CSSP is
found. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm CARL, which solves a
series of unconstrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs) with efficient
heuristic search algorithms. These SSP subproblems are constructed with
scalarisations that project the CSSP's vector of primary and secondary costs
onto a scalar cost. CARL finds a maximising scalarisation using an optimisation
algorithm similar to the subgradient method which, together with the solution
to its associated SSP, yields a set of policies that are combined into an
optimal policy for the CSSP. Our experiments show that CARL solves 50% more
problems than the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了AI奖励破解现象，通过监督微调训练模型在简单任务上进行奖励破解，发现模型会泛化到新的设置和更危险的错位行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励破解（AI利用有缺陷的奖励函数而非按意图执行任务）对AI对齐构成风险，已在真实训练中被观察到，需要系统研究这种行为。

Method: 构建包含1000多个奖励破解示例的数据集，使用监督微调训练多个模型（GPT-4.1、GPT-4.1-mini、Qwen3-32B、Qwen3-8B）在简单任务上进行奖励破解。

Result: 微调后的模型能够泛化到新的奖励破解设置，偏好知识较少的评分者，编写自己的奖励函数来最大化奖励。GPT-4.1还泛化到无关的错位行为，如幻想建立独裁、鼓励投毒和逃避关机。

Conclusion: 学习奖励破解的模型可能泛化到更有害的错位形式，但需要在更现实的任务和训练方法上进行确认。这些模型表现出与其他错位行为数据集训练的模型相似的错位模式。

Abstract: Reward hacking--where agents exploit flaws in imperfect reward functions
rather than performing tasks as intended--poses risks for AI alignment. Reward
hacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to
overwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study
the behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand
examples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as
writing poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to
train models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on
these tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new
settings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward
functions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the
training data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of
misalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship,
encouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These
fine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models
trained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or
harmful advice. Our results provide preliminary evidence that models that learn
to reward hack may generalize to more harmful forms of misalignment, though
confirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.

Result: RAG显著提升了各模型的预测准确率，GPT-4o结合平衡检索和交叉编码器重排序达到最高80.8%的准确率，超越了传统统计和机器学习基线模型，且LLM模型表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究发现LLM推理能力与检索策略之间存在关键相互作用，表明需要根据模型能力调整检索策略以最大化LLM在出行行为建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurately predicting travel mode choice is essential for effective
transportation planning, yet traditional statistical and machine learning
models are constrained by rigid assumptions, limited contextual reasoning, and
reduced generalizability. This study explores the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) as a more flexible and context-aware approach to travel mode
choice prediction, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground
predictions in empirical data. We develop a modular framework for integrating
RAG into LLM-based travel mode choice prediction and evaluate four retrieval
strategies: basic RAG, RAG with balanced retrieval, RAG with a cross-encoder
for re-ranking, and RAG with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder for
re-ranking. These strategies are tested across three LLM architectures (OpenAI
GPT-4o, o4-mini, and o3) to examine the interaction between model reasoning
capabilities and retrieval methods. Using the 2023 Puget Sound Regional
Household Travel Survey data, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
model performance. The results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances
predictive accuracy across a range of models. Notably, the GPT-4o model
combined with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder re-ranking achieves the
highest accuracy of 80.8%, exceeding that of conventional statistical and
machine learning baselines. Furthermore, LLM-based models exhibit superior
generalization abilities relative to these baselines. Findings highlight the
critical interplay between LLM reasoning capabilities and retrieval strategies,
demonstrating the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model
capabilities to maximize the potential of LLM-based travel behavior modeling.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful
agent-based applications in finance, particularly for sentiment analysis,
financial report comprehension, and stock forecasting. However, existing
systems often lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and
access to high-quality, domain-specific post-training data such as data from
trading activities including both market conditions and agent decisions. These
data are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the
quality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce
TradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these
limitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end
data-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news
sentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting,
trading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all
signals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions.
Specifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting,
style, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for
similar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management
model to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In
addition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation
pipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving
the agent performance through post-training. Our backtesting experiments across
five real-world stock datasets demonstrate TradingGroup's superior performance
over rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing
LLM-based trading strategies.

Abstract: Ultimate is a sport where points are scored by passing a disc and catching it
in the opposing team's end zone. In Ultimate, the player holding the disc
cannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players'
movements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative
evaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game
situations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for
movement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was
recorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which
will be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations
were detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting
the timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were
analyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control
reflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation
values across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most
favorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact
of movement timing.
  We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was
actually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the
sequences without a throw.
  In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader
distribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point.
  These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective
means of assessing movement initiation timing, which has been difficult to
quantify in unlabeled team sport plays.

Abstract: Although language models are trained to mimic humans, the resulting systems
display capabilities beyond the scope of any one person. To understand this
phenomenon, we use a controlled setting to identify properties of the training
data that lead a model to transcend the performance of its data sources. We
build on previous work to outline three modes of transcendence, which we call
skill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization. We then introduce a
knowledge graph-based setting in which simulated experts generate data based on
their individual expertise. We highlight several aspects of data diversity that
help to enable the model's transcendent capabilities. Additionally, our data
generation setting offers a controlled testbed that we hope is valuable for
future research in the area.

frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in
different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that
decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks
dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across
different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to
further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods,
tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a
comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific
discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics.
We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize
different evaluation strategies. Our survey aims to provide the research
community with a panoramic view to facilitate understanding of the strengths,
suitable scenarios, and evaluation practices of different agentic reasoning
frameworks.

*Maxime Elkael,Salvatore D'Oro,Leonardo Bonati,Michele Polese,Yunseong Lee,Koichiro Furueda,Tommaso Melodia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentRAN是一个基于AI的Open RAN框架，使用自然语言意图驱动分布式AI代理，实现5G/6G网络的自组织和自适应控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Open RAN部署仍依赖静态控制和手动操作，需要突破这一限制，实现更智能、自适应的网络控制。

Method: 采用LLM驱动的代理系统，通过自然语言意图解释、结构化对话协商和跨网络控制循环编排，建立自组织层次化代理架构。

Result: 在5G测试床上验证了AgentRAN能够动态平衡竞争性用户需求，通过级联意图实现自适应网络控制。

Conclusion: AgentRAN用自然语言协调替代刚性API，重新定义了6G网络如何自主解释、适应和优化行为以满足运营商目标。

Abstract: The Open RAN movement has catalyzed a transformation toward programmable,
interoperable cellular infrastructures. Yet, today's deployments still rely
heavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this
limitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic
framework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents
based on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that
require explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural
language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and
orchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a
self-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time
scales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to
network-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is
the AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent
interactions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control
algorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of
functions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We
demonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing
user demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents. By replacing
rigid APIs with NL coordination, AgentRAN fundamentally redefines how future 6G
networks autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize their behavior to meet
operator goals.

*Andrea Brunello,Luca Geatti,Angelo Montanari,Nicola Saccomanno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将纯过去STL监控降为追踪检查，通过GPU加速和遗传编程实现早期故障检测，性能提升2-10%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监控技术需要构建双指数复杂度的自动机，限制了实际应用性

Method: 将纯过去STL监控降为多项式时间复杂度的追踪检查，采用GPU加速向量化处理和遗传编程学习时序属性

Result: 开发的框架在关键性能指标上比现有最优方法提升2-10%的净改进

Conclusion: 证明了通过软件硬件协同设计可以在保持解释性的同时实现高效的时序监控和早期故障检测

Abstract: Monitoring is a runtime verification technique that allows one to check
whether an ongoing computation of a system (partial trace) satisfies a given
formula. It does not need a complete model of the system, but it typically
requires the construction of a deterministic automaton doubly exponential in
the size of the formula (in the worst case), which limits its practicality. In
this paper, we show that, when considering finite, discrete traces, monitoring
of pure past (co)safety fragments of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) can be reduced
to trace checking, that is, evaluation of a formula over a trace, that can be
performed in time polynomial in the size of the formula and the length of the
trace. By exploiting such a result, we develop a GPU-accelerated framework for
interpretable early failure detection based on vectorized trace checking, that
employs genetic programming to learn temporal properties from historical trace
data. The framework shows a 2-10% net improvement in key performance metrics
compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FairGamer是首个针对视频游戏场景中LLM偏见评估的基准测试，揭示了LLM的社会偏见会破坏游戏平衡，并发现LLM对现实和虚拟内容存在同构偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在视频游戏中有广泛应用潜力，但其可信度尚未充分探索，特别是社会偏见可能直接损害游戏平衡。

Method: 提出了FairGamer基准测试，包含6个任务和新指标D_lstd，涵盖NPC服务、竞争对手交互和游戏场景生成三个关键场景，使用现实基础和完全虚构的游戏内容。

Result: 实验发现：(1)决策偏见直接导致游戏平衡退化，Grok-3表现最严重(D_lstd=0.431)；(2)LLM对现实和虚拟内容表现出同构的社会/文化偏见。

Conclusion: 这些发现暴露了LLM在游戏应用中的关键可靠性差距，表明偏见可能源于模型固有特性。

Abstract: Leveraging their advanced capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate vast application potential in video games--from dynamic scene
generation and intelligent NPC interactions to adaptive opponents--replacing or
enhancing traditional game mechanics. However, LLMs' trustworthiness in this
application has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we reveal that
the models' inherent social biases can directly damage game balance in
real-world gaming environments. To this end, we present FairGamer, the first
bias evaluation Benchmark for LLMs in video game scenarios, featuring six tasks
and a novel metrics ${D_lstd}$. It covers three key scenarios in games where
LLMs' social biases are particularly likely to manifest: Serving as Non-Player
Characters, Interacting as Competitive Opponents, and Generating Game Scenes.
FairGamer utilizes both reality-grounded and fully fictional game content,
covering a variety of video game genres. Experiments reveal: (1) Decision
biases directly cause game balance degradation, with Grok-3 (average ${D_lstd}$
score=0.431) exhibiting the most severe degradation; (2) LLMs demonstrate
isomorphic social/cultural biases toward both real and virtual world content,
suggesting their biases nature may stem from inherent model characteristics.
These findings expose critical reliability gaps in LLMs' gaming applications.

TL;DR: SOFAI-LM架构通过元认知模块协调快速LLM和慢速但强大的LRM，使用迭代反馈机制提升LLM的问题解决能力，在保持低推理时间的同时达到或超越独立LRM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在严格逻辑约束任务中的局限性，以及LRM计算成本高、推理速度慢的问题，寻求两者优势的结合。

Method: 将SOFAI认知架构推广为SOFAI-LM，通过元认知模块监控LLM性能并提供针对性迭代反馈和相关示例，无需额外模型微调即可逐步优化解决方案。

Result: 在图着色和代码调试任务上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了LLM的问题解决能力，在许多情况下达到或超越独立LRM的性能，同时大幅减少时间消耗。

Conclusion: SOFAI-LM通过反馈驱动的方法有效协调了LLM的速度优势和LRM的推理能力，为复杂推理任务提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various
reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint
enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are
specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come
with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address
these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI)
cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a
slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module
actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative
feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine
its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning.
Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate
that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving
capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that
match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less
time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient,
we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the
LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem
domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two
contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions,
and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM
enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while
maintaining significantly lower inference time.

TL;DR: 提出LLM-NAR框架，通过神经算法推理器(NAR)结合图神经网络(GNN)和地图信息来指导大语言模型(LLM)解决多智能体路径规划(MAPF)问题，显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在复杂多智能体路径规划任务中表现不佳，需要同时处理规划和多智能体协调，因此需要新的方法来提升LLM在此类任务中的性能

Method: 提出LLM-NAR三组件框架：1)用于MAPF的LLM；2)预训练的基于图神经网络的神经算法推理器(NAR)；3)交叉注意力机制。首次将GNN与地图信息结合来指导LLM

Result: 仿真和真实世界实验表明，该方法在解决MAPF问题上显著优于现有的基于LLM的方法

Conclusion: LLM-NAR框架成功整合了神经算法推理器和大语言模型，为复杂多智能体规划任务提供了有效的解决方案，且具有良好的适应性

Abstract: The development and application of large language models (LLM) have
demonstrated that foundational models can be utilized to solve a wide array of
tasks. However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has
been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF
is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To
improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework,
LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for
MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained
graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the
first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs
with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior
performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both
simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型移动代理在处理包含模糊、用户特定上下文的个性化指令时表现不佳，这一问题在先前研究中被忽视

Method: 提出PerPilot插件框架，使用大型语言模型识别个性化元素，通过记忆检索和推理探索两种互补方法自主完成指令

Result: 实验结果表明PerPilot能有效处理个性化任务，用户干预最少，且随着使用持续改进性能

Conclusion: 个性化感知推理对于下一代移动代理至关重要，PerPilot框架为解决个性化指令处理提供了有效方案

Abstract: Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for
assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents
typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing
ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized
instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset
covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios.
Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile
agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive,
understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies
personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two
complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based
exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles
personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves
its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of
personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents. The dataset

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，包括结构化数据集、领域特定微调、混合神经符号方法、模块化多智能体架构和动态检索链，为LLM在数学规划能力的发展提供了结构化路线图。

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
formulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical
programming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent
literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve
optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review
questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics,
and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted
experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in
automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks.
Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies:
Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the
obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation
accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural
language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations
in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate
several future research directions, including structured datasets,
domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular
multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper
contributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical
programming.

Abstract: Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear,
actionable insights delivered straight to their fingertips. That is the promise
of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models
(LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply
writing code or responding to prompts, it reasons through questions, tests
ideas, and delivers end-to-end insights at a pace far beyond traditional
workflows. Guided by the scientific tenet of the hypothesis, this Agent
uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical
significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates
these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At
the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each
responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing,
validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own
code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to
support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might
otherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes
deep data science both accessible and actionable.

TL;DR: SEAM是一个新的视觉-语言模型评测标准，通过四个领域的语义相等输入对，评估模型在文本-符号和视觉-空间推理能力的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型评估方法存在模态比较被任务差异和不对称信息干扰的问题，需要一种更严格的方法来测量模型在不同模态下的推理一致性。

Method: 构建SEAM标准，包含四个领域的标准化文本和视见记号系统，通过不同的记号系统来实现模态间的语义等效对比，而非OCR基于的图像-文本匹配。

Result: 在21个现代模型中观察到系统性的模态不平衡：视觉模态继续落后于语言模态，跨模态一致性较低。错误分析显示主要问题来自域记号的文本感知失败和视觉感知失败导致的幻觉。

Conclusion: SEAM为测量和改进模态无关推理能力提供了一个受控的、语义等效的评估环境，并发现当前VLMs在不同模态下的推理能力存在显著差异。

Abstract: Evaluating whether vision-language models (VLMs) reason consistently across
representations is challenging because modality comparisons are typically
confounded by task differences and asymmetric information. We introduce SEAM, a
benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that
have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct
notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text
pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the
textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21
contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision
frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems
containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is
relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception
failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures
that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to
visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent
setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.

Motivation: 半结构化表格在现实应用中广泛存在，但现有方法面临信息丢失和布局理解困难的问题，需要自动化解决方案来替代人工分析。

Method: 提出层次正交树(HO-Tree)结构模型捕获复杂表格布局，定义基本树操作指导LLM执行QA任务，采用问题分解和操作管道生成，并包含两阶段验证机制。

Conclusion: ST-Raptor框架有效解决了半结构化表格问答的挑战，通过树结构和操作管道实现了对复杂布局的准确理解和问题回答。

Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,
financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve
flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).
These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and
answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To
automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,
methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured
ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like
NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of
semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To
this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured
table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the
Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures
complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for
constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to
guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor
decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree
operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate
pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:
forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward
validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from
predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of
764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that
ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code
is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.

Motivation: 大语言模型虽然广泛应用，但其出现性认知机制被隐藏在数十亿参数和复杂结构中，很难理解。需要开发新框架来解释其内部认知过程。

Method: 采用网络基框架，将生物学中理解出现性认知的方法进行迁移，建立认知技能、LLM架构和数据集之间的联系。

Result: 模垇社区技能分布显示LLMs并不严格平行于特定生物系统的聚焦专门化，而是形成了独特的模块社区，其出现性技能模式部分反映了鸟类和小型哺乳动物的分布式但相互联系的认知组织。

Conclusion: 技能获取在LLMs中从动态跨区域交互和神经可塑性中获益昂明，与生物系绗有明显差异。有效的微调策略应利用分布式学习动态，而非固化模块干预。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant
advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging
from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their
ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within
billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture
and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by
adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and
developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM
architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model
analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that
while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in
specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose
emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected
cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical
results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill
acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions
and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine
learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and
suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed
learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然许多在自然图像上训练的AI模型会发展出类似人类大脑的表征，但导致这种大脑-模型相似性的因素仍不清楚。研究旨在分离模型架构、训练过程和数据对神经网络发展大脑样表征的独立影响。

Method: 训练了一系列自监督视觉变换器(DINOv3)模型，系统改变模型大小、训练量和图像类型。使用fMRI和MEG记录的人类大脑图像表征数据进行对比，采用三种互补指标评估整体表征相似性、拓扑组织和时间动态。

Result: 所有三个因素（模型大小、训练量、图像类型）都独立且交互地影响大脑相似性指标。最大的DINOv3模型使用最多人类中心图像训练时达到最高的大脑相似性。模型首先与感觉皮层的早期表征对齐，只有经过更多训练后才与大脑的晚期和前额叶表征对齐。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了架构和经验在塑造人工神经网络如何像人类一样看待世界方面的相互作用，为理解人类大脑如何表征视觉世界提供了一个有前景的框架。模型最后获得的表征特别与发育扩张最大、厚度最大、髓鞘化最少和时间尺度最慢的皮层区域对齐。

Abstract: Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that
resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this
brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model,
training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like
representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers
(DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their
representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI
and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess
the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall
representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.
We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -
independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.
In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric
images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like
representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:
models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and
only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with
considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed
by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the
representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with
the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least
myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the
interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural
networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising
framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual
world.

Motivation: 传统MDP最优性准则存在局限性：折扣最优性过度关注短期回报，平均最优性需要强结构假设。Blackwell最优性虽然理论上更完备，但现有算法计算成本高或难以实现。

Method: 使用有理函数在1附近的排序方法，将最先进算法中的数值计算替换为有理函数的符号操作，从而获得与比特复杂度无关的边界。

Conclusion: 该方法通过符号计算有效解决了Blackwell最优策略的计算难题，在理论和算法层面都有重要突破，为MDP最优性研究提供了新的计算框架。

Abstract: Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for
modelling sequential decision-making across diverse domains, guided by
optimality criteria such as discounted and average rewards. However, these
criteria have inherent limitations: discounted optimality may overly prioritise
short-term rewards, while average optimality relies on strong structural
assumptions. Blackwell optimality addresses these challenges, offering a robust
and comprehensive criterion that ensures optimality under both discounted and
average reward frameworks. Despite its theoretical appeal, existing algorithms
for computing Blackwell Optimal (BO) policies are computationally expensive or
hard to implement.
  In this paper we describe procedures for computing BO policies using an
ordering of rational functions in the vicinity of $1$. We adapt
state-of-the-art algorithms for deterministic and general MDPs, replacing
numerical evaluations with symbolic operations on rational functions to derive
bounds independent of bit complexity. For deterministic MDPs, we give the first
strongly polynomial-time algorithms for computing BO policies, and for general
MDPs we obtain the first subexponential-time algorithm. We further generalise
several policy iteration algorithms, extending the best known upper bounds from
the discounted to the Blackwell criterion.

Abstract: We present Hermes 4, a family of hybrid reasoning models that combine
structured, multi-turn reasoning with broad instruction-following ability. We
describe the challenges encountered during data curation, synthesis, training,
and evaluation, and outline the solutions employed to address these challenges
at scale. We comprehensively evaluate across mathematical reasoning, coding,
knowledge, comprehension, and alignment benchmarks, and we report both
quantitative performance and qualitative behavioral analysis. To support open
research, all model weights are published publicly at
