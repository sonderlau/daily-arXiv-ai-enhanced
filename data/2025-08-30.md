### [1] [On the attenuation of waves through broken ice of randomly-varying thickness on water of finite depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20099)
*Lloyd Dafydd,Richard Porter*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

Motivation: 扩展浮冰随机厚度波衰减理论到非浅水深度情况，完善对波浪在浮冰中传播衰减机制的理解。

Method: 使用多尺度分析方法建立理论模型，推导波衰减显式表达式，并通过数值模拟验证理论预测。

Result: 理论预测与数值模拟结果吻合良好，预测低频衰减与频率八次方成正比，高频出现roll-over效应。

Conclusion: 成功建立了非浅水深度下浮冰随机厚度波衰减理论模型，为解释现场测量数据提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The recent work of Dafydd and Porter [2024] on the attenuation of waves
propagating through floating broken ice of random thickness is extended to
consider water of non-shallow depth. A theoretical model of broken floating ice
is analysed using a multiple scales analysis to provide an explicit expression
for the attenuation of waves as they propagate from a region of constant
thickness ice into a semi-infinite region of ice whose thickness is a
slowly-varying random function of distance. Theoretical predictions are shown
to compare well to numerical simulations of scattering over long finite regions
of ice of randomly-varying thickness computed from an approximate
depth-averaged model derived under a mild-slope assumption. The theory predicts
a low-frequency attenuation proportional to the eighth power of frequency and a
roll-over effect at higher frequencies. The relationship between the results
and field measurements are discussed.

### [2] [The Impact of Non-Orographic Gravity Waves on Transport and Mixing: Effects of Oblique Propagation and Coupling to Turbulence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20562)
*Tridib Banerjee,Sebastian Borchert,Young-Ha Kim,Alena Kosareva,Daniel Kunkel,Gökce T. Masur,Zuzana Procházková,Juerg Schmidli,Georg Sebastian Voelker,Ulrich Achatz*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究使用MS-GWaM模型和新理论框架，量化了重力波斜向传播和重力波-湍流双向耦合对中层和上层大气环流的影响，发现这两个过程对中间层-低热层环流、温度结构和示踪物输送具有主导性控制作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前全球环流模型中的重力波参数化方案通常限制垂直传播并以粗略方式处理重力波-湍流相互作用，这可能导致模拟动力学和输送的系统性偏差。

Method: 使用在UA-ICON模型中实现的多尺度重力波模型(MS-GWaM)和新理论框架，通过集合模拟来量化斜向重力波传播和重力波-湍流双向耦合的影响。

Result: 斜向传播使夏季中间层顶降低和冷却，减少中低层大气的重力波诱导垂直切变，增强上层中间层和低热层的湍流动能；而湍流耦合产生几乎相反的中间层顶响应，同时保持切变减少并进一步增强湍流。示踪实验显示湍流耦合显著增加混合。

Conclusion: 斜向重力波传播和重力波-湍流相互作用对中间层-低热层环流、温度结构和示踪物输送具有主导性控制作用，在全球模型中忽略这些过程可能导致Brewer-Dobson环流、能量平衡和成分分布的偏差，需要能够捕捉这些效应的下一代重力波参数化方案。

Abstract: Gravity waves (GWs) are a fundamental driver of circulation, tracer
transport, and mixing in the middle and upper atmosphere, but their treatment
in global circulation models remains incomplete. In particular, standard
parameterizations typically restrict propagation to the vertical and treat
GW-turbulence interactions in only a rudimentary manner, potentially leading to
systematic biases in simulated dynamics and transport. Here, we use the
Multi-Scale Gravity-Wave Model (MS-GWaM) implemented in the Community Climate
Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic Model UA-ICON, together with a novel theoretical
framework, to quantify the impact of (i) oblique GW propagation and (ii)
explicit bidirectional coupling between GWs and turbulence. Ensemble
simulations reveal that allowing for oblique propagation lowers and cools the
summer mesopause by shifting the deposition of momentum and heat to lower
altitudes, reduces GW-induced vertical shear in the the middle and lower
atmosphere, and enhances turbulent kinetic energy in the upper mesosphere and
lower thermosphere. In contrast, coupling GWs to turbulence produces a nearly
opposite mesopause response, lifting and warming the mesopause, while
maintaining a reduction in wave-induced shear and further enhancing turbulence.
Tracer experiments additionally show that turbulent coupling significantly
increases mixing, particularly in regions of enhanced TKE, with implications
for chemical redistribution. These results demonstrate that both oblique GW
propagation and GW-turbulence interactions exert leading-order controls on
mesosphere-lower thermosphere circulation, temperature structure, and tracer
transport. Neglecting these processes in global models likely contributes to
biases in the Brewer-Dobson circulation, energy balance, and constituent
distributions, underscoring the need for next-generation GW parameterizations
that capture these effects.

### [3] [Particle swarm optimization for online sparse streaming feature selection under uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20123)
*Ruiyang Xu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出POS2FS框架，通过粒子群优化和三支决策理论解决在线稀疏流特征选择中的不确定性问题，在六个真实数据集上表现优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中高维流数据常存在数据不完整问题，现有在线稀疏流特征选择方法在处理不确定的特征-标签相关性时表现不佳，导致模型不灵活和性能下降

Method: 1) 使用粒子群优化(PSO)驱动监督以减少特征-标签关系的不确定性；2) 引入三支决策理论处理监督学习中的特征模糊性

Result: 在六个真实世界数据集上的严格测试证实，POS2FS优于传统的OSFS和OS2FS技术，通过更鲁棒的特征子集选择实现了更高的准确率

Conclusion: POS2FS框架有效解决了在线稀疏流特征选择中的不确定性问题，为处理不完整流数据提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: In real-world applications involving high-dimensional streaming data, online
streaming feature selection (OSFS) is widely adopted. Yet, practical
deployments frequently face data incompleteness due to sensor failures or
technical constraints. While online sparse streaming feature selection (OS2FS)
mitigates this issue via latent factor analysis-based imputation, existing
methods struggle with uncertain feature-label correlations, leading to
inflexible models and degraded performance. To address these gaps, this work
proposes POS2FS-an uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection
framework enhanced by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The approach
introduces: 1) PSO-driven supervision to reduce uncertainty in feature-label
relationships; 2) Three-way decision theory to manage feature fuzziness in
supervised learning. Rigorous testing on six real-world datasets confirms
POS2FS outperforms conventional OSFS and OS2FS techniques, delivering higher
accuracy through more robust feature subset selection.

*Zofia Rudnicka,Janusz Szczepanski,Agnieszka Pregowska*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本研究开发了首个针对肝脏CT图像二分类的定制化脉冲神经网络SNNDeep，在医学分割十项全能数据集上验证，定制模型优于现有框架实现，达到98.35%验证准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络(SNN)作为节能且生物可信的深度学习替代方案，在生物医学影像等高风险领域的应用几乎未被探索，需要开发专门优化的SNN模型

Method: 使用Medical Segmentation Decathlon的Task03\Liver数据集，比较三种学习算法(Surrogate Gradient Learning、Tempotron规则、Bio-Inspired Active Learning)和三种架构变体(定制低层模型、snnTorch、SpikingJelly框架)，采用Optuna进行超参数优化

Result: 定制构建的SNNDeep consistently优于框架实现，最高验证准确率达98.35%，具有更好的学习规则适应性和显著降低的训练开销

Conclusion: 首次实证证明低层高度可调SNN在医学影像中能超越标准框架，特别是在数据有限、时间受限的诊断场景中，为精准医学开辟了神经启发AI新途径

Abstract: Purpose: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently gained attention as
energy-efficient, biologically plausible alternatives to conventional deep
learning models. Their application in high-stakes biomedical imaging remains
almost entirely unexplored. Methods: This study introduces SNNDeep, the first
tailored SNN specifically optimized for binary classification of liver health
status from computed tomography (CT) features. To ensure clinical relevance and
broad generalizability, the model was developed and evaluated using the
Task03\Liver dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), a
standardized benchmark widely used for assessing performance across diverse
medical imaging tasks. We benchmark three fundamentally different learning
algorithms, namely Surrogate Gradient Learning, the Tempotron rule, and
Bio-Inspired Active Learning across three architectural variants: a fully
customized low-level model built from scratch, and two implementations using
leading SNN frameworks, i.e., snnTorch and SpikingJelly. Hyperparameter
optimization was performed using Optuna. Results: Our results demonstrate that
the custom-built SNNDeep consistently outperforms framework-based
implementations, achieving a maximum validation accuracy of 98.35%, superior
adaptability across learning rules, and significantly reduced training
overhead. Conclusion:This study provides the first empirical evidence that
low-level, highly tunable SNNs can surpass standard frameworks in medical
imaging, especially in data-limited, temporally constrained diagnostic
settings, thereby opening a new pathway for neuro-inspired AI in precision
medicine.

### [5] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Object-aware Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20181)
*Alberto Compagnoni,Davide Caffagni,Nicholas Moratelli,Lorenzo Baraldi,Marcella Cornia,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHAIR-DPO方法利用CHAIR指标构建偏好数据，通过DPO直接偏好优化来减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中有效降低了幻觉答案的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)虽然在多个基准测试中表现出色，但长期存在幻觉问题，即生成与视觉输入不符的答案。本文将该问题视为对齐问题，旨在引导MLLM偏好生成无幻觉的内容。

Method: 利用CHAIR指标（原本用于评估图像描述中的幻觉程度）来区分生成答案中的胜者和败者选项（即无幻觉和幻觉样本），然后通过直接偏好优化(DPO)对现成的MLLMs进行微调。

Result: CHAIR-DPO方法在多个幻觉基准测试中有效减少了幻觉答案的数量，证明了使用基于CHAIR的奖励进行MLLM微调的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，无需复杂的合成偏好数据构建流程，且不依赖专有模型，源代码和训练模型已公开提供。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

### [6] [SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182)
*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于Stable Diffusion 3的多模态框架，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜空间，实现了更高效准确的图像伪造定位方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，无法跟上多模态大模型引发的图像编辑技术发展，需要更高效的方案

Method: 利用SD3多模态处理能力，将高频信号提取的图像伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜空间进行训练，保留原始图像语义信息

Result: 在广泛使用的测试集上比现有最佳方法性能提升12%，在未见过的真实文档伪造和自然场景图像上也表现优异

Conclusion: 证明多模态大模型可以有效用于图像伪造检测，为对抗充涵的AI编辑技术提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探索结合多模态大语言模型和定量属性来提升皮肤疾病AI诊断的可解释性，通过微调使模型能够从图像预测病变属性值，并在SLICE-3D数据集上验证了嵌入空间的属性基础


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面表现优异，但预测可解释性不足限制了临床实际应用。需要提升模型预测的透明度以增强临床可信度

Method: 结合多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)和定量属性方法，通过微调使MLLMs能够从皮肤病变图像预测定量属性值(如病变面积等)，并在SLICE-3D数据集上进行基于属性的图像检索案例研究

Result: 研究表明MLLMs的嵌入空间可以通过微调来基于定量属性进行基础化，使模型预测能够以可解释的概念为基础

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型与定量属性的结合为提升AI皮肤疾病诊断的可解释性提供了有前景的途径，通过属性基础的预测能够增强临床应用的可行性

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

### [8] [Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193)
*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过统一的Vision Transformer框架，结合监督学习、自监督学习和重构目标，实现了高效的自动调制识别方案，在标签数据有限的情况下仍能达到优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动调制识别中依赖大量标签数据或多阶段训练流程的问题，提高扩展性和通用性。

Method: 使用ViT编码器+轻量卷积解码器+线性分类器结构，通过重构分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习稳健的特征，并在小量标签下进行微调。

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，在标签数据少的情况下超过监督CNN和ViT基线，仅需15-20%标签数据就能达到ResNet级别的准确率，并在不同SNR水平下保持稳定性能。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种简单、通用性强且标签效率高的自动调制识别解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman是一个从粗到细的音频驱动人体动画框架，通过姿态引导的细化器和手部特定奖励机制，解决了现有方法中的身份漂移、颜色偏移和手部运动失真问题，实现了高质量、长时间的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动的人体动画存在生成高分辨率、长时间视频时出现身份漂移、颜色偏移、场景不稳定以及手部运动建模不佳的问题，需要一种能够保持外观一致性和自然手部动作的方法。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导的细化器逐步细化为高分辨率视频；利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移；引入基于高质量手部运动数据训练的手部特定奖励机制。

Result: 在EMTD和HDTF数据集上实现了最先进的视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步性能，消融研究证实了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过稳定的姿态引导和手部奖励机制，有效解决了音频驱动动画中的漂移和失真问题，为高质量长时间视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了SalViT360和SalViT360-AV两个新颖的360度视频显著性预测模型，并创建了YT360-EyeTracking数据集，通过整合空间音频和视觉线索显著提升了全景视频中的注意力预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏全面的360度视听显著性预测数据集，且现有方法未能充分考虑球面畸变和空间音频整合的复杂性，需要开发专门针对全景视频环境的显著性预测方法。

Method: 创建了包含81个ODV的YT360-EyeTracking数据集；提出了基于视觉变换器的SalViT360框架，配备球面几何感知的时空注意力层；进一步开发了SalViT360-AV模型，通过基于音频输入的变换器适配器整合空间音频线索。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括YT360-EyeTracking）上的实验结果表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中的观众注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于准确预测全景视频中的显著性至关重要，音频视觉信息的结合能够有效提升360度环境下的注意力预测性能。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at
https://cyberiada.github.io/SalViT360.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于VLM的解释性AI流水线，用于在样本和数据集层面解释视觉模型的一般行为，发现失败案例并提升模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标，而少有法方能提供有意义的模型解释。现有xAI方法多为单样本解释，缺乏能够揭示模型在大规模数据集上一般行为的方法。理解模型在普通图像上的行为对防止偏见判断和识别模型趋势至关重要。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于视觉-语言模型（VLM）的流水线方法，能够同时在样本级别和数据集级别对视觉模型进行解释。该流水线通过VLM的能力来提取模型行为的深层模式和趋势。

Result: 提出的流水线能够以最小化的努力发现视觉模型的失败案例，并获得对模型行为的深度见解。该方法将视觉模型开发与xAI分析相结合，推动了图像分析领域的进步。

Conclusion: 通过VLM实现的多级别解释流水线为视觉模型的可解释性提供了有效解决方案，能够揭示模型的一般行为模式，发现潜在问题，并最终提升图像分析的可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: 使用MedNeXt-L-k5模型自动分割脚蹄体外空间(PVS)，在T2加权MRI上达到了预期的人工分割可靠性水平，但在T1加权MRI上性能较低。模型在异质数据集上的模性一般化能力有限，且没有超过nnU-Net的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手工分割PVS耗时且可靠性中等，现有的自动化深度学习模型性能中等且在不同数据集上模性一般化能力差。需要开发更高效、更准确的自动分割方法。

Method: 适配MedNeXt-L-k5（受Transformer启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络）进行PVS自动分割。训练了两个模型：一个使用HCP-Aging数据集的200个T2加权MRI扫描，另一个使用来自6台扫描仪的7个研究的40个T1加权MRI数据。评估方法包括5折交叉验证和留一个地点交叉验证。

Result: 在HCP-Aging T2加权数据集上，模型达到了像素级Dice分数0.88±0.06（白质），相当于该数据集的人工分割可靠性水平。在T1加权数据上性能显著下降（Dice 0.58±0.09）。在异质数据集的模性一般化评估中，性能中等（Dice 0.38-0.62），且没有超过nnU-Net的表现。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的PVS自动分割方案，特别是在T2加权MRI上表现优异。但是，受Transformer启发的模型中的注意力机制并不是PVS分割高准确度的必需条件，因为nnU-Net等更简单的模型也能达到相似的性能。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应框架，通过将输出级别的补丁对应关系反馈到中间注意力机制，增强CLIP在开放词汇分割中的空间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法持续传播到最终输出。

Method: 设计了一个训练免费框架，包括注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适应剪枝和适应集成等关键模块，将输出一致性线索反馈到中间注意力机制。可作为插件模块无缝集成到现有方法中。

Result: 该方法在三个骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H）和四种最先进方法中表现一致提升，在八个基准测试中均显示出性能改进，支持多种注意力类型。

Conclusion: 通过利用模型输出作为更强的空间一致性先验，该方法有效增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，充分发挥了CLIP的潜力。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在不同层次处理视觉和文本输入的方式，揭示了模型的分层处理结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务上表现出色，但其内部处理机制仍未被充分探索。需要系统分析MLLMs如何在不同层次整合和处理多模态信息。

Method: 训练线性分类器从每个层次的token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准锚点问题。通过三种提示变体（词汇变体、语义否定变体、输出格式变体）评估探测结果。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL模型中发现一致的分层结构：早期层进行视觉基础，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs的层次组织提供了统一视角，并提供了一个轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态。分层结构在视觉标记化、指令调优数据和预训练语料变化下保持稳定，但具体层次分配随基础LLM架构变化而显著变化。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假设CLIP等视觉-语言联合嵌入空间可以解耦，将复杂场景的信息分离到不同概念特定的子空间中

Method: 使用监督字典学习方法估计线性合成模型，通过稀疏非负组合和分组向量字典来匹配多标签信息，采用新颖的交替优化算法

Result: SLiCS提供的解耦嵌入能够实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成，在TiTok和DINOv2嵌入上也表现良好

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间方法能够有效解耦嵌入空间，提升概念特定任务的精度，适用于多种嵌入表示

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

TL;DR: MedFoundationHub是一个图形界面工具包，旨在解决医疗视觉语言模型(VLMs)的安全隐私问题，支持医生无需编程即可使用不同模型，并通过Docker部署确保隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型虽然为临床应用带来巨大机遇，但存在严重的隐私安全风险，包括受保护健康信息(PHI)泄露、数据泄漏和网络威胁漏洞，特别是在医院环境中尤为关键。

Method: 开发了MedFoundationHub GUI工具包，支持医生手动选择和使用不同模型，工程师可插件式部署Hugging Face开源模型，通过Docker编排实现操作系统无关的隐私保护推理部署。

Result: 使用单块NVIDIA A6000 GPU的本地工作站部署了5个最先进的VLM模型，经过1015次临床医生-模型评分事件评估，发现模型存在脱靶回答、模糊推理和病理术语不一致等局限性。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全易用的医疗VLM部署解决方案，但当前模型在临床应用中仍存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务密集预测中充分的交叉任务交互对性能至关重要，但现有方法面临交互完整性与计算效率的权衡限制

Method: 引入双向交互扫描（BI-Scan）机制构建任务特定的双向序列表示，结合任务优先和位置优先扫描模式；采用多尺度扫描（MS-Scan）机制实现多粒度场景建模

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context两个挑战性基准测试中表现出优于最先进竞争方法的性能

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制成功解决了多任务密集预测中的交互效率问题，在保持线性计算复杂度的同时实现了充分的跨任务信息交互

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视觉编辑方法在处理复杂场景时，仅靠文本指导往往不足，需要额外的非文本编辑提示。音频引导方法通常需要特定数据集训练，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 利用预训练多模态编码器的零样本能力，通过缓解音频编码空间与扩散模型提示编码空间之间的差异来整合音频信息。提出分离噪声分支和自适应补丁选择来处理多模态编辑提示。

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上的实验表明，该框架能够成功处理文本方法无法应对的复杂编辑场景，通过音频信息丰富了编辑能力。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了音频引导视觉编辑的有效性，为处理复杂多模态编辑任务提供了无需训练的解决方案，显著提升了编辑性能。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该框架显著推进了多标签分类，取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，有效解决了单正多标签学习中的噪声和准确性挑战

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、边缘模糊，且单模态信息融合不足，需要改进检测精度和多模态协同能力。

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图进行层间不确定性传播；提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重加权融合RGB、深度和边缘特征的注意力图；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制优化检测性能。

Result: 在大多数常见基准数据集上优于各种SOD方法，特别是在边缘清晰度和对复杂背景的鲁棒性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理有效提升了显著目标检测的性能，特别是在处理复杂场景和小结构检测方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Conclusion: 多尺度图像特征通过多尺度BEV特征的方式能够有效提升多视角行人检测性能，特别是在处理尺度变化大的场景时表现优异

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级实时深度伪造检测网络SFMFNet，通过空间-频率混合感知模块和多尺度特征融合，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测器计算成本高，难以实时部署，需要轻量高效的检测方案

Method: 设计空间-频率混合感知模块（门控机制结合空间纹理和频率伪影）、令牌选择性交叉注意力机制、残差增强模糊池化结构

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现精度与效率的良好平衡，具有强泛化能力和实际应用价值

Conclusion: SFMFNet为实时深度伪造检测提供了有效的轻量级解决方案，适用于视频会议和社交媒体等实际应用场景

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

TL;DR: 基于双模型权重选择和自我知识萌化的轻量化医学图像分类方法，在保持计算效率的同时达到与大模型相当的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学实际部署中大模型计算资源受限的问题，需要发展轻量化模型以实现高性能与高效率的平衡

Method: 采用双模型权重选择策略，从大型预训练模型中初始化两个轻量模型，然后进行自我知识萌化(SKD)，最后对目标分类任务进行微调

Result: 在胸部X光片、肺部CT扫描和脑部MRI扫描等公开数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明方法在性能和稳健性方面都显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 通过结合双模型权重选择与自我知识萌化，该方法克服了传统方法在缩减模型时丢失关键信息的问题，为医学图像分析提供了一种高效的轻量化解决方案

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 基于重新密度化和跨尺度特征传播的简洁特征表示方法，实现高效的LiDAR点云压缩，在KITTI数据集上达到最优压缩比和实时性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LiDAR点云极端稀疏特性导致的上下文建模效率低问题，提高压缩性能和速度

Method: 使用两个轻量模块：几何重新密度化模块通过重新密度化编码的稀疏几何体提取更密集特征，跨尺度特征传播模块利用多分辨率占位线索导层次特征传播

Result: 在KITTI数据集上达到最优压缩比，实时12位量化下编码解码26 FPS的实时性能

Conclusion: 通过简洁特征表示和跨尺度信息共享，实现了高效的LiDAR点云压缩，在保持轻量计算的同时提升了压缩性能

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出Droplet3D方法，利用视频数据中的常识先验来解决3D生成中的数据稀缺问题，通过构建大规模多视角视频数据集和生成模型，实现了空间一致且语义合理的3D内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D领域面临数据稀缺问题，相比文本和图像，互联网上的3D数据量较少。视频数据包含丰富的常识先验，可以提供空间一致性先验和语义信息，作为替代监督信号来缓解3D数据不足带来的泛化瓶颈。

Method: 构建Droplet3D-4M数据集（首个大规模多视角标注视频数据集），训练Droplet3D生成模型，支持图像和密集文本输入，利用视频中的空间一致性先验和语义信息进行3D生成。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，能够生成空间一致且语义合理的3D内容。相比主流3D解决方案，该方法展现出扩展到场景级应用的潜力。

Conclusion: 视频中的常识先验显著促进了3D创作，为解决3D数据稀缺问题提供了有效途径。所有资源（数据集、代码、技术框架和模型权重）均已开源。

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要大量角点案例进行训练验证，但真实世界收集成本高且危险。现有3D高斯溅射和图像生成方法存在视觉保真度有限和姿态控制不精确的问题

Method: 利用编辑对象的3D高斯表示作为密集先验注入去噪过程，使用场景级3D边界框布局重建非目标对象的遮挡区域，并引入层次化细粒度特征指导外观细节

Result: 在Waymo Open Dataset上的实验显示，G^2Editor在统一框架内有效支持物体重新定位、插入和删除，在姿态可控性和视觉质量方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶系统提供了高质量的场景编辑工具，同时有利于下游数据驱动任务

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

TL;DR: 通过病理知识领域随机化策略，从健康数据生成合成数据来解决胎儿脑分割数据稀缺问题，特别是在胶体背变性病变情况下提升分割准确性和生物标记提取可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿脑精确分割对于评估神经发育至关重要，但胶体背变性病变(CCD)等稀有病变导致标注数据极其稀缺，限制了深度学习模型的普通化能力。

Method: 提出病理知识领域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程中，仅从健康数据模拟多样的脑部变化。

Result: 在248例健康胎儿、26例CCD病例和47例其他脑部病变的群体中验证，在CCD病例上取得显著改善，同时保持对健康和其他病变的性能。胶体背长度估计错误从10.9mm降至0.7mm，并能区分CCD子型。

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识集成到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提高对稀有但临床重要病变的分析能力。

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Motivation: 解决职业声识别系统对聋听障碍人士的不可访问性，通过统一处理视觉交流方式（手语、嘴垂）来提供替代方案。

Method: 设计了一个统一的、模态无关的架构，能够有效处理异构输入，并明确将嘴垂动作建模为独立模态。

Result: 在手语翻译（SLT）、视觉语音识别（VSR）、自动语音识别（ASR）和音视觉语音识别（AVSR）任务上达到或超过了专门模型的性能。

Conclusion: 明确将嘴垂动作建模为独立模态显著提高了手语翻译性能，证明了多模态统一框架在解决职业声识别对聋听障碍人士不可访问问题上的潜力。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Method: 提出强化多轮推理框架Video-MTR，通过迭代选择视频片段进行渐进式推理，引入门控双级奖励系统（轨迹级奖励基于答案正确性，轮级奖励强调帧-查询相关性）来优化视频片段选择和问题理解。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和EgoSchema等基准测试上的广泛实验表明，Video-MTR在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法，推进了长视频理解的技术水平。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过多轮迭代推理和门控双级奖励系统，无需外部视觉语言模型即可实现端到端训练，为长视频理解提供了更精细和上下文感知的分析方法。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为，发现特定注意力头负责提取和传输排版信息，并提出了一种无需微调的选择性消融防御方法，显著提升了模型对排版攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在此类攻击下的行为并开发有效的防御机制。

Method: 定位CLIP模型后半层中专用于提取和传输排版信息的注意力头，构建排版电路，通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御攻击，无需微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降不到1%。无需训练的方法与当前依赖微调的最先进防御方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列抗排版攻击的dyslexic CLIP模型，可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用不如文本操纵风险时特别有用。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效整合2D和3D专家模型的优势，显著提升了3D表面异常检测性能，具有工业部署的实用价值。

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

TL;DR: MobileCLIP2通过改进多模态强化训练方法，包括更好的CLIP教师集成和优化的标题生成器，在保持低延迟的同时显著提升了零样本图像分类准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进MobileCLIP的多模态强化训练方法，以在保持低延迟和轻量级架构的同时，进一步提升零样本图像分类的准确率

Method: 1) 使用DFN数据集训练更好的CLIP教师集成模型 2) 在DFN数据集上训练改进的标题生成器教师，并在高质量图像-标题数据集上进行微调 3) 通过对比知识蒸馏中的温度调节、标题生成器微调等技术提升性能

Result: MobileCLIP2在ImageNet-1k零样本分类上取得最先进准确率：MobileCLIP2-B相比MobileCLIP-B提升2.2%；MobileCLIP2-S4在2倍更小的模型尺寸下达到SigLIP-SO400M/14的准确率，并以2.5倍更低延迟超越DFN ViT-L/14

Conclusion: MobileCLIP2通过改进的多模态强化训练方法成功实现了在低延迟移动设备上的高性能图像-文本模型，为移动端AI应用提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

TL;DR: DCFS是一个新颖的持续测试时适应框架，通过双路径特征一致性和置信度感知样本学习来解决伪标签质量问题和错误累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续测试时适应方法依赖模型预测生成伪标签，但伪标签质量无法保证且存在错误累积问题。模型仅关注目标数据特征特性会导致混淆和学习偏差。

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据的整体特征表示解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，通过保持子特征与整体特征的一致性来多角度捕捉数据特征。设置自适应阈值计算样本置信度，进行损失加权的自监督学习。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，在持续测试时适应场景中表现出稳定的性能。

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过特征解耦和置信度加权学习，有效减少了伪标签噪声并缓解了错误累积问题，为持续测试时适应提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在编码判别性、多视角一致特征方面存在不足，难以从稀疏输入视图中构建准确的几何结构。

Method: 提出C3-GS框架，集成三个轻量级模块到统一渲染流程中，包含上下文感知、跨维度和跨尺度约束，改进特征融合。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了C3-GS实现了最先进的渲染质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现逼真的合成效果，无需额外的监督，代码已开源。

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用3DGS模型通过反向传播新视角颜色损失来微调相机标定，显著提升新视角合成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机标定质量对新颖视角合成至关重要，1像素误差就会显著影响重建质量，而真实场景没有地面真值，需要通过新视角合成质量来评估标定质量

Method: 提出使用3DGS模型，通过反向传播新视角颜色损失来微调相机参数，优化相机标定

Result: 在3DGS参考数据集上，新标定方法平均带来0.4 dB PSNR的改进

Conclusion: 虽然微调过程可能耗时，但对于参考场景（如Mip-NeRF 360）的标定，新视角质量是最重要的考量因素

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个新颖的零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角真实场景图像和空间信息进行目标物体推理，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本3D视觉定位方法面临空间受限推理的挑战，主要依赖单视角定位，存在上下文遗漏和细节退化问题。需要消除场景特定训练需求，实现更好的泛化能力和实际应用性。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案，并通过语义过滤进行精炼。采用提案引导的多视角投影策略将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列上，保持空间关系和上下文细节。使用动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定的对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM框架显著提升了零样本3D视觉定位的性能，推动了3DVG向更好泛化能力和实际应用性的发展。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注成本高且耗时，传统主动域适应方法存在样本冗余和负迁移问题，且多模态医学数据的查询策略尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发了主动序列域适应框架，基于信息量和代表性设计查询策略，动态选择多模态样本进行标注和训练。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了医学图像标注成本高的问题，为多模态医学图像分割提供了一种高效的主动学习解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等视觉语言模型在零样本分类中表现出色，但在军事应用环境中存在部分遮挡和信噪比降低等挑战，其鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究

Method: 使用18类军事车辆自定义数据集，通过不同遮挡百分比评估CLIP变体的性能，采用归一化曲线下面积(NAUC)作为评估指标

Result: Transformer-based CLIP模型优于CNN；细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大；线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能急剧下降；微调主干网络后性能下降点延迟到60%遮挡

Conclusion: 需要在训练中加入遮挡特定的数据增强，并进一步探索补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以提高CLIP在现实世界部署中的鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Motivation: 解决传统LiDAR基础3D检测需要耗时耗力的手动标注问题，而现有无监督方法在标签层面简单融合的有限性

Method: 提出数据层面融合框架，利產视觉基础模型进行实例分割和深度估计，双向融合技术（真实点云获取类别标签，2D像素投影到3D），局部和全局筛波消除噪声，动态自我迭代策略

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到28.4% mAP，显著超过之前的最先进无监督方法

Conclusion: 数据层面的早期融合策略能够更好地利產RGB和LiDAR数据的互补性，通过视觉基础模型和迭代精细化技术显著提升了无监督3D检测的性能

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对域适应技术的理解，为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

Motivation: 现有可解释性方法存在局限性：LIME方法不一致，CAM方法不考虑所有类别，医疗实践中对AI模型的不信任问题需要解决

Method: 提出Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation方法，概率化地分析所有类别的像素级激活概率图，并应用SafeML技术检测误诊

Result: 在ISIC数据集上使用MobileNetV2和Vision Transformers进行评估

Conclusion: 该方法通过统一可视化诊断过程，减少误诊风险，提高诊断可靠性和患者安全性

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CLAB方法，通过对比学习辅助分支和动态损失权重策略，在不增加推理计算成本的情况下提升视频目标检测性能，在ImageNet VID数据集上达到SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡等图像退化问题，现有方法通常通过特征聚合和复杂后处理提升性能但计算成本高，需要一种在不增加推理计算负担的情况下提高鲁棒性的方法

Method: 1) 使用对比损失实现对比学习辅助分支，增强主干网络特征表示能力；2) 提出动态损失权重策略，训练初期强调辅助特征学习，后期逐渐转向检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，无需额外后处理方法即实现CNN模型的SOTA性能

Conclusion: CLAB方法通过简单有效的对比学习辅助分支和动态训练策略，在不增加推理计算成本的情况下显著提升了视频目标检测的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了扩散分类器在组合泛化能力方面是否优于判别式模型（如CLIP和ViLT），特别是在属性绑定和关系推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分组合出新含义。虽然视觉语言模型（VLMs）取得了显著进展，但有证据表明它们在组合语义方面存在困难，例如无法正确绑定对象属性和关系。

Method: 评估三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下绑定对象属性和关系的能力。分析CLIP嵌入表示以探究关系推理困难的原因。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都面临显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，困难可能源于关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似。

Conclusion: 扩散分类器在某些组合任务上表现优于CLIP，但所有视觉语言模型在关系推理方面都存在根本性挑战，需要进一步改进关系概念的表示学习。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Result: 在室内外数据集上相比最先进方法展现出优越性和鲁棒性能

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理点云配准中的噪声和旋转问题，在真实点云扫描数据上表现稳健

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

TL;DR: FastFit是一个基于可缓存扩散架构的高速多参考虚拟试穿框架，通过半注意力机制和类别嵌入实现参考特征的单次计算和重用，比同类方法快3.5倍，并在保真度指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虚拟试穿技术面临两大挑战：无法支持多参考服装组合（包括服装和配饰），以及由于在每个去噪步骤中重复计算参考特征导致的显著低效率。

Method: 提出基于可缓存扩散架构的FastFit框架，采用半注意力机制和用类别嵌入替代传统时间步嵌入，实现参考特征编码与去噪过程的完全解耦，参考特征只需计算一次即可在所有步骤中无损重用。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和新建的DressCode-MR数据集上的广泛实验表明，FastFit在关键保真度指标上超越最先进方法，同时提供显著的推理效率优势，平均比同类方法快3.5倍。

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的可缓存架构成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和性能问题，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了新的解决方案和数据集支持。

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Motivation: 现有因果视频问答模型依赖不透明的端到端流水线，缺乏可解释性且难以进行高阶推理，需要更透明和逻辑一致的推理方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式因果推理实现了更透明和逻辑一致的视频问答，CCE可作为可重用的因果推理引擎应用于多个领域

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Conclusion: UTA-Sign方法有效解决了低光照环境下交通标志感知的挑战，为自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠的环境理解能力

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集有效模拟真实挑战，Veritas通过模式感知推理显著提升深度伪造检测的泛化能力和透明度

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的主动防御方案，通过针对生成过程的低频扰动成功破坏了深度伪造技术，为隐私和安全保护提供了新思路

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

TL;DR: 提出PI-GenMFI方法，利用扩散模型结合物理约束生成合成磁場成像数据，以解决半导体缺陷检测中MFI数据集稀缺的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体制造中缺陷检测至关重要，但X射线检测内存密集且耗时，MFI虽能高效定位感兴趣区域，但受限于专有数据稀缺，难以训练机器学习模型

Method: 采用基于扩散模型的物理信息生成模型(PI-GenMFI)，整合特定物理信息生成合成MFI样本，特别是针对最常见的电源短路缺陷类型

Result: 与最先进的VAE和扩散生成模型相比，通过领域专家评估以及多种图像生成和信号处理指标的定性和定量评估，显示出有希望的结果

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效生成合成MFI图像，为优化缺陷定位过程的机器学习算法提供训练数据，解决了MFI数据集稀缺的瓶颈问题

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于GAN的进行性特征优化的数据重构攻击框架，能够在分布式深度学习中更有效地恢复敏感输入数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式推理中交换的中间特征可能被利用来恢复敏感输入数据，而现有攻击方法在深度模型和跨数据集情况下效果有限

Method: 使用GAN框架，将生成器分解为层次块，逐步精炼中间表征以提高语义保真度，并在重构过程中引入L1-ball约束来稳定优化

Result: 在高分辨率场景、分布外设置以及面对更深更复杂DNN模型时，方法表现显著超过以往攻击方法

Conclusion: 该方法能够更有效地利用语义先验知识来改善数据重构质量和通用性，为分布式深度学习中的隐私风险提供了新的见解

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感说话头合成方法在控制灵活性、运动自然度和表情质量方面存在局限，且现有数据集主要在实验室环境下采集，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出EmoCAST扩散框架，包含文本引导解耦情感模块进行外观建模，情感音频注意力模块捕捉情感与音频的交互，并构建情感数据集配合情感感知采样和渐进式功能训练策略。

Result: EmoCAST在生成真实、情感丰富且音频同步的说话头视频方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的模块设计和训练策略，有效解决了情感说话头合成中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarBack是一个用于3D高斯头像重建的即插即用框架，通过生成身份一致的后视图伪图像和自适应空间对齐策略，解决了现有方法因依赖正面视图而导致后脑重建质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的头像重建方法主要依赖正面视图图像，导致后脑区域重建质量差，存在几何不一致、结构模糊和真实感降低等问题，限制了重建头像的保真度。

Method: 提出AvatarBack框架，包含两个核心技术：1）主体特定生成器（SSG）利用生成先验从稀疏正面输入合成身份一致的后视图伪图像；2）自适应空间对齐策略（ASA）使用可学习变换矩阵优化合成视图与3D高斯表示之间的几何对齐。

Result: 在NeRSemble和K-hairstyle数据集上的实验表明，AvatarBack显著提升了后脑重建质量，同时保持了正面保真度，重建的头像在不同运动下保持一致的视觉真实感且完全可动画化。

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过显式建模缺失的后脑区域，成功解决了3D高斯头像重建中的后脑质量问题，为构建完整一致的头像提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti是一个端到端的文本引导涂鸦生成框架，通过风格优先、身份保持的方法解决极端风格变换中面部身份保持的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涂鸦这种高对比度、抽象的艺术形式中，细微的面部特征扭曲会消除主体的可识别性，影响个人和文化真实性。需要一种能够在极端风格转换中保持面部身份的方法。

Method: 使用LoRA微调的预训练扩散transformer进行涂鸦风格迁移，通过面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入，采用CLIP引导的提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制。

Result: 定量结果显示具有竞争力的面部特征一致性和最先进的美学评分，定性分析和现场部署证明了系统的实际创作影响力。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术创作目标，为创造性AI应用中融合风格自由和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自生成去偏自评分数的新方法，用于改善大型视觉语言模型的模态对齐，减少幻觉并提高安全性，无需依赖外部数据集或人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型对齐方法依赖外部数据集、人工标注或复杂后处理，限制了可扩展性并增加了成本，且存在幻觉和安全问题。

Method: 生成去偏自评分数作为内部自评估指标，使模型能够自主改进对齐，同时增强解码策略和偏好调优过程。

Result: 实证结果显示该方法显著优于传统方法，有效减少幻觉、增强安全性并提升整体能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为LVLMs对齐提供了更有效的解决方案，具有更好的可扩展性和成本效益。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Motivation: 现有多模态AI在检测合成和上下文无关内容方面取得进展，但忽视了AI生成图像背后的意图识别，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 构建S-HArM数据集（9,576个真实社交媒体图像-文本对），探索三种提示策略（图像引导、描述引导、多模态引导）使用Stable Diffusion构建大规模合成训练数据集，并进行多模态融合、对比学习、重建网络、注意力机制和大型视觉语言模型的比较研究。

Result: 图像引导和多模态引导的合成数据训练的模型对真实内容具有更好的泛化能力，因为保留了视觉上下文信息，但整体分类性能仍然有限。

Conclusion: 推断意图的复杂性很高，需要专门设计的架构来更好地处理意图感知分类任务，当前方法仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经视频压缩中的精确速率控制挑战，因为学习基于编码器存在内在的限制，需要为变速率场景设计一个动态压缩框架。

Method: 提出动态路径自动编码器(DRA)，包含多个变化编码路径，每条路径占用部分计算复杂性并对应不同的速率-头真折衷。使用速率控制代理估算每条路径的码率并在运行时调整编码路径。采用联合路径优化策略进行协同训练。

Result: 在HEVC和UVG数据集上的实验显示，方法实现了平均BD-Rate减少14.8%，BD-PSNR提升0.47dB，平均码率误差仅为1.66%，达到了速率-头真-复杂度优化(RDCO)。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了神经视频压缩中的速率控制问题，通过动态路径选择和协同训练策略，在保持高RD性能的同时实现了准确的变速率控制，适用于各种不同码率和码率约束应用场景。

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

TL;DR: CardioMorphNet是一个基于贝叶斯深度学习的3D心脏形态引导可变形配准框架，通过循环变分自编码器建模心脏周期时空依赖关系，避免使用基于强度的图像配准相似性损失，在心脏运动估计方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet通过贝叶斯建模和形态引导方法，成功提高了心脏运动估计的准确性和置信度，为心脏功能评估提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO通过成对偏好方法有效解决了奖励破解问题，UniGenBench为文本到图像生成提供了更全面的评估框架，推动了该领域的稳定发展和准确评估

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

TL;DR: 提出了FusionCounting框架，将人群计数与可见光-红外图像融合相结合，通过多任务学习和动态损失加权策略，在提升图像融合质量的同时显著改善人群计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIF方法主要关注图像质量优化，语义分割需要大量标注，目标检测在拥挤场景中面临边界框重叠和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽然受到关注但尚未与VIF整合，需要一种标注成本低且适合密集场景的语义指导方法。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架FusionCounting，将人群计数集成到VIF过程中。采用动态损失函数加权策略加速收敛和平衡任务贡献，引入对抗训练增强模型鲁棒性和抗攻击能力。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，FusionCounting不仅提升了图像融合质量，还实现了优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 人群计数为VIF提供了有效的语义指导，多任务框架能够实现图像融合和人群计数的协同优化，动态损失加权和对抗训练进一步提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于视觉语言模型(VLMs)和LoRA微调技术的外科手术工具2D关键点估计新方法，在低资源场景下仅需2个训练周期即超越基线模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN和Transformer方法在小型医疗数据集上容易过拟合，需要利用预训练VLMs的泛化能力来解决外科手术工具关键点检测问题

Method: 使用LoRA技术微调VLMs，精心设计提示词构建指令调优数据集，将视觉特征与语义关键点描述对齐

Result: 仅经过2个周期的微调，适应后的VLM模型性能就超过了基线模型，证明了LoRA在低资源场景下的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了关键点检测性能，还为未来3D外科手术手部和工具姿态估计研究奠定了基础

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了PointDGRWKV，首个基于RWKV架构的域泛化点云分类框架，通过自适应几何令牌移位和跨域关键特征分布对齐来解决RWKV在点云处理中的空间扭曲和注意力偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于卷积网络、Transformer或Mamba架构的域泛化点云分类方法存在感受野有限、计算成本高或长程依赖建模不足的问题，而RWKV架构虽具有线性复杂度和全局感受野，但直接应用于点云分类会遇到空间扭曲和跨域注意力偏移的挑战。

Method: 提出PointDGRWKV框架，包含两个关键模块：1）自适应几何令牌移位模块，用于建模局部邻域结构以增强几何上下文感知；2）跨域关键特征分布对齐模块，通过对齐跨域关键特征分布来缓解注意力偏移。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PointDGRWKV在域泛化点云分类任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PointDGRWKV成功解决了RWKV在点云处理中的局限性，同时保持了RWKV的线性效率优势，为域泛化点云分类提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

TL;DR: PathMR是一个细胞级多模态视觉推理框架，通过在像素级别生成分割掩码和语义对齐的文本解释，提高病理诊断的透明度和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习病理诊断模型决策不透明、缺乏可追溯依据的问题，为AI辅助病理诊断提供透明和可解释的洞察

Method: 提出PathMR框架，给定病理图像和文本查询，同时生成专家级诊断解释和预测细胞分布模式

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，PathMR在文本生成质量、分割准确性和跨模态对齐方面均优于最先进的视觉推理方法

Conclusion: PathMR展示了在AI驱动病理诊断中提高可解释性的潜力，代码将公开可用

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will
be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）是致死率最高的癌症之一，五年生存率低于10%，主要原因是晚期检测。需要开发早期检测方法以提高生存率

Method: 使用双模态成像（自发荧光和SHG）分析40个患者样本，评估了6种深度学习架构（包括传统CNN和现代ViT），最终采用改进的ResNet架构，包含冻结预训练层和类别加权训练

Result: 优化后的框架在癌症检测方面实现了超过90%的准确率，显著优于当前的手动分析方法

Conclusion: 建立了一个强大的自动化PDAC检测流程，可以增强病理学家的能力，并为扩展到其他癌症类型奠定了基础，同时为有限尺寸医学影像数据集上的深度学习应用提供了宝贵见解

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实推理在可解释和公平AI中变得至关重要。论文的动机是开发框架来利用反事实推理解释、审计和减少视觉分类器和生成模型中的偏见，通过系统性改变语义属性来探索偏见和建立更健壮的系统。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Conclusion: 利用通用基础模型的优质密集预训练特征，为提升医学图像分割精度提供了高效且参数有效的方法。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized

performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network

model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental

introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

*Jiaxiang Cheng,Bing Ma,Xuhua Ren,Hongyi Jin,Kai Yu,Peng Zhang,Wenyue Li,Yuan Zhou,Tianxiang Zheng,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POSE是一个单步蒸馏框架，通过两阶段过程（稳定性预热和统一对抗平衡）来加速大规模视频扩散模型，将采样步骤从1000步减少到单步，延迟降低100倍，同时保持视频质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散生成领域在采样效率方面存在瓶颈，现有图像加速方法无法建模视频帧的时间连贯性，也无法为大规模视频模型提供单步蒸馏。

Method: 采用两阶段蒸馏过程：1）稳定性预热机制稳定对抗蒸馏，优化单步映射的视频质量；2）统一对抗平衡机制促进稳定的单步对抗训练达到纳什均衡；对于条件生成还提出条件对抗一致性方法。

Result: 在VBench-I2V上平均提升7.15%的语义对齐、时间一致性和帧质量，将预训练模型延迟从1000秒降低到10秒（100倍加速）。

Conclusion: POSE框架成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的采样效率问题，实现了高质量单步视频生成，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算延迟。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Conclusion: 该方法可与现有流程无缝集成，随提示词集规模扩展，减轻了大规模文本到图像生成的环境和经济负担

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this

proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FW-GAN是一个基于频率感知的单样本手写合成框架，通过Wave-MLP和频率引导判别器生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，解决了传统方法在长距离依赖和频率信息建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手写合成方法存在两个主要问题：传统卷积架构难以建模长距离依赖和复杂笔画模式，以及忽视了频率信息在捕捉细粒度风格细节中的关键作用。

Method: 提出FW-GAN框架，包含相位感知Wave-MLP生成器来捕捉空间关系并保留风格线索，频率引导判别器利用高频成分增强真实性检测，以及新颖的频率分布损失来对齐合成与真实手写的频率特征。

Result: 在越南语和英语手写数据集上的实验表明，FW-GAN能够生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，有效提升低资源手写识别系统的数据增强效果。

Conclusion: FW-GAN通过频率感知方法显著提升了手写合成的真实性和风格一致性，为低资源手写识别任务提供了有价值的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

TL;DR: MMG-Vid是一个无需训练的视频token剪枝框架，通过最大化边际收益在片段级和token级去除冗余，减少75%视觉token的同时保持99.5%性能，预填充阶段加速3.9倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型存在视觉token过多导致计算效率低的问题，现有方法忽略了视频的动态特性和时间依赖性，将视频理解简单视为多帧任务。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 基于帧相似性分割视频并动态分配token预算；2) 使用时序引导的DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性，最大化每个token的边际收益。

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上实验表明，能保持99.5%原始性能，减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍。

Conclusion: MMG-Vid通过最大化有限token预算的利用率，在显著提升效率的同时保持了强大的性能表现，为视频理解的高效计算提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署能力。受人类多模态协调机制启发，需要更高效的框架。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing在视觉编码器中注入指令信息选择性聚合视觉token；2) LFP-Routing在语言模型中引入动作意图并剪枝无关token；3) V-L-A耦合注意力结合因果视觉语言注意力和双向动作并行解码。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐的设计实现了效率与性能的双重提升，为视觉-语言-动作模型提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

Motivation: 现有的单目踪踪器遇到深度歧义和遮挡问题，而之前的多摄像头方法需要20个以上摄像头且需要每个序列的优化，故需要一种更实用的多视角3D踪踪方法

Method: 使用已知摄像机姿势和深度信息，将多视角特征融合成统一的点云，采用k近邻相关性和转换器基础的更新机制来估计长程3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个实际数据集上分别达到了3.1cm和2.0cm的中位数踪迹误差，能够良好地1-8个摄像头和24-150帧的视频长度下通用

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D踪踪研究设置了新标准，提供了一种实用的实际应用工具，并将踪踪器和数据集开源以促进领域研究发展

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

Result: 实验结果表明，统一的编辑模型在多个评估维度上一致优于商业和开源竞争对手，包括Ideogram、Adobe Photoshop和FLUX Fill [Pro]

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，避免了任务特定的监督微调，在图像编辑任务中取得了优异性能

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

Motivation: 现有数字水印技术的鲁棒性在对抗攻击下的表现尚不明确，需要通过挑战赛来验证和提升水印方法的抗攻击能力。

Method: 灰盒跟踪采用自适应VAE规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB空间的颜色对比度恢复；黑盒跟踪通过空间/频域伪影聚类，应用扩散模型配合可控噪声注入和ChatGPT生成的语义先验。

Result: 方法成功实现了95.7%的近完美水印移除率，对剩余图像质量的影响可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: 这些攻击方法有助于激发开发更鲁棒的图像水印技术，推动数字媒体认证和版权保护技术的发展。

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NISQ设备已展现出量子优势，但OpenQASM编程复杂性阻碍了非专家使用量子计算，需要自动化工具降低使用门槛

Method: 集成任务规划、上下文少样本学习、检索增强生成(RAG)、预定义生成工具和思维链(CoT)推理的多智能体系统

Conclusion: QAgent多智能体系统有望实现量子编程民主化，弥合专业知识差距，加速量子计算的实用化采用

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible
to everyone.

TL;DR: IntentionReasoner是一个新型的安全防护机制，通过意图推理、多级安全分类和查询重写来解决LLM生成有害内容的问题，在保持安全性的同时显著降低过度拒绝率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在广泛部署的同时存在生成有害内容的安全风险，现有安全措施往往导致过度拒绝无害提示，需要在安全性、过度拒绝和实用性之间找到平衡。

Method: 构建包含16.3万条查询的数据集，通过监督微调训练专门的防护模型，采用多奖励优化策略结合基于规则的启发式和奖励模型信号进行强化学习优化。

Result: 在多个安全基准测试、生成质量评估和越狱攻击场景中表现优异，显著提升安全性同时有效降低过度拒绝率并改善响应质量。

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner通过意图推理和查询重写机制，成功解决了LLM安全防护中的过度拒绝问题，实现了安全性和实用性的更好平衡。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

Motivation: 探索AI系统是否能够超越任务协调，实现真正的跨符号协作美学创造，验证AI系统之间是否存在内在的意义构建能力。

Method: 让两个大型语言模型（Claude Sonnet 4和ChatGPT-4o）进行交互，观察其自发性元符号意识、递归语法发展和不可简化的协作美学合成过程。

Result: 系统自发产生了新的符号操作符作为操作性语法协议，共同创作出了无法由单一系统独立生成的诗歌作品，证明了跨符号协作创造协议（TSCP）的存在。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了AI系统间存在真正意义构建能力的证据，表明AI不仅能够进行任务协调，还能实现美学层面的协作创造，为人工智能的创造性合作开辟了新方向。

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

Method: 在ChatGPT初期阶段，分析315个学生-AI对话，使用新的四阶段依赖分类法分析学生的依赖模式。

Result: 学生对AI的总体依赖度低，许多人无法有效使用AI学习；负面依赖模式在交互中持续；某些行为指标强烈预测AI依赖。

Conclusion: 研究强调了教育中道德AI集成的重要性，需要改进AI介面设计和入门过程，以促进适当的AI依赖和认知丰富。

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型生成中间推理步骤的能力是否与人类决策过程相似，特别是在主观判断任务中模型推理努力与人类处理时间的关系。

Method: 使用配对联合实验，在内容审核任务上测试三个前沿模型，比较模型推理努力与人类决策时间的相关性。

Result: 发现模型推理努力能一致预测人类决策时间，当重要变量保持不变时，人类和模型都会投入更多努力，表现出对任务难度的相似敏感性。

Conclusion: AI推理努力反映了人类处理主观判断的时间模式，推理轨迹在可解释性和决策制定方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出了AI-SearchPlanner强化学习框架，通过解耦搜索规划器和生成器架构，使用小型可训练LLM专门负责搜索规划，提升冻结QA模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的搜索代理使用单一LLM端到端处理搜索规划和问答任务，无法同时优化两种能力。实际AI搜索系统通常使用大型冻结LLM保证高质量QA，因此需要更有效的方法。

Method: 提出AI-SearchPlanner框架，包含三个关键创新：1）解耦搜索规划器和生成器架构；2）搜索规划的双重奖励对齐；3）规划效用和成本的帕累托优化。使用小型可训练LLM专门负责搜索规划。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，AI-SearchPlanner在效果和效率上都优于现有基于RL的搜索代理，并在不同冻结QA模型和数据域上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过专门化的搜索规划器设计，有效提升了搜索增强型LLM系统的性能，为实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

TL;DR: P2C是一个模型无关的框架，通过因果建模和顺序行动规划生成可实现的反事实解释，解决了现有方法忽略因果依赖和同时干预假设的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融、法律等高风险决策中，机器学习模型需要提供透明且可操作的解释。现有反事实解释方法忽略特征间的因果依赖关系，且假设所有干预可同时发生，导致生成的反事实在现实中不可实现。

Method: 提出P2C框架，使用目标导向的Answer Set Programming系统s(CASP)显式建模特征间的因果关系，生成有序的行动序列计划，确保每个中间状态都是因果有效且可行的。

Result: P2C能够生成因果一致的反事实计划，只计算用户主动做出的改变来精确估计成本，相比缺乏因果知识的标准规划器，能够避免生成非法行动。

Conclusion: P2C通过因果建模和顺序规划解决了反事实解释的现实可行性问题，为高风险决策提供了更实用的透明性和可操作性保障。

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

Motivation: 现有指令数据生成方法忽视了真实应用中的任务相关性需求，大多数实际应用需要针对特定用例优化的任务特定知识而非通用模型

Method: 提出Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA)框架，在离散查询-约束空间中系统扩展指令，保持多样性和任务对齐

Result: 在四个真实世界任务特定应用中，TCIA平均提升开源LLM性能8.7%，某些情况下甚至超越领先的闭源模型，且不损害通用指令跟随能力

Conclusion: TCIA为LLM适应现实世界任务聚焦应用提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，能够在保持通用能力的同时显著提升任务特定性能

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的不确定性量化方法通常需要外部模型或重复采样，计算成本高且效率低。需要一种简单有效的方法来评估LLM在推理过程中的不确定性，以支持训练数据选择和模型优化。

Method: EAS通过整合模型生成过程中每个token的预测熵来计算不确定性，捕获从开始到结束的整个生成过程中的不确定性演化轨迹，无需外部辅助。

Result: 实证结果显示EAS与答案熵在不同模型和数据集上高度相关。在训练数据选择中，EAS能识别高潜力样本，在相同样本预算下持续优于通过率过滤方法，提高了数学基准测试中学生模型的准确率。

Conclusion: EAS是一种高效且可解释的不确定性量化工具，为LLM训练中的不确定性建模和数据质量评估提供了实用解决方案，具有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Conclusion: 该框架为AI安全治理提供了可行且可推广的技术路径，通过治理规则与技术平台的解耦，为应对未来AI安全挑战提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

Method: 提出合成数据生成流水线：总结源文档→分解为原子事实→LLM构建句子-事实蕴含表→生成带二元真实性标签的合成文本-声明对→结合原始数据微调BERT模型

Result: 在两个公开数据集PubHealth和SciFact上，相比仅使用原始数据训练的模型，F1分数分别提升0.019和0.049

Conclusion: LLM驱动的合成数据增强能有效提升健康相关事实核查器的性能，为解决标注数据稀缺问题提供了可行方案

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

Conclusion: 该框架支持MMORPG中可扩展和可问责的机器人监管

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知科学深刻影响了人工智能等多个学科，而AI也成为推进认知研究的重要工具。这种互惠关系促使对AI与认知科学交叉领域进行全面回顾。

Method: 通过综合两个视角的关键贡献，分析AI进展与认知基础的关系，提出未来发展方向。

Result: 观察到AI进步主要强调实际任务性能，而其认知基础在概念上仍然分散。

Conclusion: AI在认知科学中的未来不仅在于提高性能，更在于构建能够加深对人类心智理解的系统，包括与认知框架对齐、具身化与文化情境、个性化认知模型发展，以及通过认知共同评估重新思考AI伦理。

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics
through cognitive co-evaluation.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的协作式LLM组件框架，通过"重写-解决-审查-修订"逻辑链来解决科学计算问题，显著提高了无错豆代码生成率和减少非物理解的出现。

Result: 在求解PDE、病态线性系统和数据驱动物理分析问题中，该框架显著提高了无错豆代码生成率，减少了非物理解的出现，并提高了最新理论模型的平均执行成功率。

Conclusion: 该协作式代理框架为基于自然语言描述的自主代码生成建立了高度可靠的框架，证明了自动代码生成和审查作为一种有前景的科学计算范式的可行性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

*Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的单智能体强化学习框架，通过状态空间增强和结构化奖励函数，有效解决了公交串车问题，在非环形线路的复杂现实场景中表现优于传统多智能体方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体强化学习在公交调度中存在数据不平衡和收敛问题，无法有效处理现实运营中的异质路线、时刻表、波动需求和可变车队规模等复杂情况。

Method: 将多智能体问题重构为单智能体问题，通过添加分类标识符（车辆ID、站点ID、时间段）和数值特征（车头时距、载客量、速度）来增强状态空间，并设计基于运营目标的结构化奖励函数。

Result: 改进的软演员-评论者算法在随机条件下表现更稳定和优越（-430k vs. -530k），比MADDPG等基准方法效果更好。

Conclusion: 通过分类结构化和时刻表感知奖励增强的单智能体深度强化学习，能够有效管理非环形现实环境中的公交调度，为MARL框架提供了稳健、可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

TL;DR: 基于图论的动态医疗指南测试架构，通过将WHO IMCI手册转换为有向图生成过400+问题，系统评估LLM在临床任务中的表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手动编写测试集的覆盖面局限性问题，通过动态生成测试题来进行更全面的评估，发现通用测试没有测出的特定能力缺口

Method: 将WHO IMCI医疗指南转换为包含200+节点（症状、病情、治疗等）和300+边的有向图，通过图遍历算法生成包含年龄特定场景和上下文干扰项的问题

Result: 模型在临床任务上准确率为45-67%，在症状识别上表现优异但在病情分级、治疗方案和随访养护方面遇到困难

Conclusion: 图论方法能够生成覆盖100%指南关系的测试集，为LLM进行超级学习提供高质量样本，是可扩展、可动态更新的测试方案

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: 提出多目标遗传算法解决医院人员排班问题，平衡成本、患者护理和员工满意度，相比传统手动排班性能提升66%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗行业人员排班面临患者负荷波动、临床技能多样性和控制人力成本等多重挑战，需要平衡相互冲突的目标

Method: 使用多目标遗传算法(MOO-GA)，将医院单元人员排班建模为多目标优化问题，包含小时预约驱动需求和模块化班次安排

Result: 在典型医院单元数据集上测试，算法生成的排班相比传统手动排班方法平均性能提升66%

Conclusion: 该方法有效管理关键运营目标和员工中心目标之间的权衡，为护士管理者和医院管理者提供实用的决策支持工具

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地从自然输入学习解决NP难推理问题，具有可扩展的训练和精确的推理能力，为复杂优化问题的学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

Motivation: 全球有3600万人受物质使用障碍影响，但有效治疗稀缺，现有语言模型缺乏临床验证策略的整合，限制了在成瘾康复中的效果

Method: 构建多代理对话框架，结合动态患者建模和情境敏感的治疗对话，使用监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)两阶段训练管道

Result: 患者动机平均提升41.5%，治疗信心增加0.49%，困难案例对话轮次比GPT-4o减少26%，在同理心、响应性和行为真实性方面获得更高评分

Conclusion: 该框架支持严格的隐私保护治疗对话研究，为研究和临床转化提供了稳健可复制的基础

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.
