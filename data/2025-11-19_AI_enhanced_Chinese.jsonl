First, it requires pre-training on large-scale extra data and complex designs for prior knowledge, leading to high energy consumption. Second, the predicted edges perform poorly in crispness and heavily rely on post-processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as third generation neural networks, feature quantization and spike-driven computation mechanisms. They inherently provide a strong prior for edge detection in an energy-efficient manner, while its quantization mechanism helps suppress texture artifact interference around true edges, improving prediction crispness. However, the resulting quantization error inevitably introduces sparse edge discontinuities, compromising further enhancement of crispness. To address these challenges, we propose MS2Edge, the first SNN-based model for edge detection. At its core, we build a novel spiking backbone named MS2ResNet that integrates multi-scale residual learning to recover missing boundary lines and generate crisp edges, while combining I-LIF neurons with Membrane-based Deformed Shortcut (MDS) to mitigate quantization errors. The model is complemented by a Spiking Multi-Scale Upsample Block (SMSUB) for detail reconstruction during upsampling and a Membrane Average Decoding (MAD) method for effective integration of edge maps across multiple time steps. Experimental results demonstrate that MS2Edge outperforms ANN-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, PLDU, and PLDM datasets without pre-trained backbones, while maintaining ultralow energy consumption and generating crisp edge maps without post-processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "MS2Edge\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(SNN)\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u3001I-LIF\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u548c\u819c\u57fa\u53d8\u5f62\u6377\u5f84\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(ANN)\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u4e14\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u7cca\u4f9d\u8d56\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3002SNN\u5177\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u9a71\u52a8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6548\u9ad8\u4e14\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u7eb9\u7406\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4f46\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMS2Edge\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1) MS2ResNet\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u6062\u590d\u8fb9\u754c\u7ebf\uff1b2) I-LIF\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ed3\u5408MDS\u7f13\u89e3\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b3) SMSUB\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u7ec6\u8282\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b4) MAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fb9\u7f18\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728BSDS500\u3001NYUDv2\u3001BIPED\u3001PLDU\u548cPLDM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aANN\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8d85\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6e05\u6670\u8fb9\u7f18\u56fe\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "MS2Edge\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SNN\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u80fd\u3001\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3aSNN\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Echo state networks (ESN) are a model class in which the reservoir is a traditional artificial neural network. This class contains many model types, each with sets of hyperparameters. Selecting models and parameter settings for particular applications requires a theory for predicting and comparing performances. Here, we demonstrate that recent developments of perceptron theory can be used to predict the memory capacity and accuracy of a wide variety of ESN models, including reservoirs with linear neurons, sigmoid nonlinear neurons, different types of recurrent matrices, and different types of readout networks. Across thirty variants of ESNs, we show that empirical results consistently confirm the theory's predictions. As a practical demonstration, the theory is used to optimize memory capacity of an ESN in the entire joint parameter space. Further, guided by the theory, we propose a novel ESN model with a readout network that does not require training, and which outperforms earlier ESN models without training.

This biological principle inspired the attention mechanism in modern Transformers. Transformers now underpin large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, but at the cost of massive training and inference energy, leading to a large carbon footprint. While brain attention emerges from neural circuits, Transformer attention relies on dot-product similarity to weight elements in the input sequence. Neuromorphic computing, especially spiking neural networks (SNNs), offers a brain-inspired path to energy-efficient intelligence. Despite recent work on attention-based spiking Transformers, the core attention layer remains non-neuromorphic. Current spiking attention (i) relies on dot-product or element-wise similarity suited to floating-point operations, not event-driven spikes; (ii) keeps attention matrices that suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck, limiting in-memory computing; and (iii) still diverges from brain-like computation. To address these issues, we propose the Spiking STDP Transformer (S$^{2}$TDPT), a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query--key correlations in synaptic weights. STDP, a core mechanism of memory and learning in the brain and widely studied in neuromorphic devices, naturally enables in-memory computing and supports non-von Neumann hardware. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our model achieves 94.35\\% and 78.08\\% accuracy with only four timesteps and 0.49 mJ on CIFAR-100, an 88.47\\% energy reduction compared to a standard ANN Transformer.

However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances", "AI": {"tldr": "SpatiaLite\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdbVLMs\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5fc3\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdbVLMs\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u60f3\u8c61\uff08\u7a7a\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u62df\uff09\u662f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SpatiaLite\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u6d4b\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790VLMs\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff08IDF\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a1\uff09\u5148\u8fdbVLMs\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u60f3\u8c61\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u611f\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u548c3D\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u9677\uff1b2\uff09VLMs\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u6548\u7387\u4e25\u91cd\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u53d8\u6362\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0ctoken\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u7684IDF\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u9690\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9VLMs\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7SpatiaLite\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63cf\u7ed8\u4e86\u5148\u8fdbVLMs\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u9650\u5236\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347VLMs\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Due to the lack of standardized, large-scale, and thoroughly verified datasets to facilitate learning of meaningful intermediate representations, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, closed-loop E2E models remain far behind even simple rule-based baselines.

We develop a conditional generative framework that maps a label (a vector of partial observations) to an ensemble of plausible aerosol states and propagates these to diagnostics, yielding mean estimates with confidence intervals. Using synthetic data, we evaluate two label configurations: a low-dimensional setup with limited number distribution and bulk-composition information, and a high-dimensional setup including complete number and total mass distributions plus species bulk masses. Generated samples maintain strong label compliance, and higher-dimensional labels markedly reduce variability. CCN activity and volume scattering are well constrained even under the low-dimensional setup, whereas dust- and BC-sensitive diagnostics (frozen fraction, absorption) benefit substantially from the additional information in the high-dimensional case.

A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy.

However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance.

This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting.

They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \\textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies.

While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design.

To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals.

Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $\u03b2$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.", "AI": {"tldr": "CORGI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u907f\u514dRETE\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d88\u8017\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\u7f13\u6162\u6216\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\uff1a\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u6784\u5efa/\u7ef4\u62a4\u63a5\u5730\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff0c\u540e\u5411\u8fed\u4ee3\u5668\u6309\u9700\u751f\u6210\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edfRETE\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u03b2\u5185\u5b58\u6536\u96c6\u90e8\u5206\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cCORGI\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7ec4\u5408\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSOAR\u548cOPS5\u7684RETE\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "CORGI\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u586b\u5145\u5b8c\u6574\u51b2\u7a81\u96c6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u884c\u3002"}}

However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cc\u7f51\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08ADATG\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u6765\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u5728\u987a\u5e8f\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u79bb\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7f16\u7801\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u5173\u6ce8\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u518d\u9010\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\u5230\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u9707\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u9707\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos.

The findings highlight key challenges concerning transparency, cultural bias, and the definition of hybrid evaluation metrics, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment of AI in educational environments.\n  This research contributes to a unified framework that bridges technical, pedagogical, and ethical considerations, offering evidence-based guidance for the design and application of intelligent agents in computational musicology and music education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7efc\u5408\u56de\u987e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u548cRAG\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6848\u4f8b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6559\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u8fde\u63a5\u6280\u672f\u3001\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u8003\u91cf\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7efc\u5408\u56de\u987e\u548c\u53cc\u6848\u4f8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a(1)\u5728\u4e2d\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e73\u53f0\u57f9\u517b\u5206\u6790\u6027\u548c\u521b\u9020\u6027\u6280\u80fd\uff1b(2)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u97f3\u4e50\u5206\u6790\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u4f5c\u66f2\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u53cd\u9988\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u6587\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u90e8\u7f72AI\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u97f3\u4e50\u5b66\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners.

However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C).

While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable.

Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources.

Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code.\n  All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode.

However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network. We find that the explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, validating that modeling the inverse rendering process is a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u56de\u5f52(GRR)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edd\u5bf9\u59ff\u6001\u56de\u5f52(APR)\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5c04\u7ebf\u675f\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u70b9\u56fe\uff09\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u57287-Scenes\u548cCambridge Landmarks\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAPR\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u76f4\u63a5\u56de\u5f526-DoF\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u56fe\u800c\u975e\u7406\u89e33D\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06APR\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u5c04\u7ebf\u675f\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u70b9\u56fe\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u673a\u5e73\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6062\u590d\u6700\u7ec8\u59ff\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u57287-Scenes\u548cCambridge Landmarks\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u56de\u5f52\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c06\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u7edd\u5bf9\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups.

AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated.

We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLM\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6548\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5206\u6790LLM\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684LLM\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8fd9\u79cd\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f1a\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u539f\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7684LLM\u4e5f\u5f00\u59cb\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6548\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542bLLM\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u771f\u5b9e/\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6709\u5411\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684LLM\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7100\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u8282\u70b9\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6846\u67b6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7ba1\u7406LLM\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks.

However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout.

The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet.

Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour.

In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability.

Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark.

In this study, we focus on the scaling relationship with data size in the context of medical anatomical segmentation, a domain that remains underexplored. We analyze scaling laws for anatomical segmentation across 15 semantic tasks and 4 imaging modalities, demonstrating that larger datasets significantly improve segmentation performance, following similar scaling trends. Motivated by the topological isomorphism in images sharing anatomical structures, we evaluate the impact of deformation-guided augmentation strategies on data scaling laws, specifically random elastic deformation and registration-guided deformation. We also propose a novel, scalable image augmentation approach that generates diffeomorphic mappings from geodesic subspace based on image registration to introduce realistic deformation. Our experimental results demonstrate that both registered and generated deformation-based augmentation considerably enhance data utilization efficiency. The proposed generated deformation method notably achieves superior performance and accelerated convergence, surpassing standard power law scaling trends without requiring additional data.

Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\\% (single run) to 25\\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \\textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance.

Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model.

We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models.

We introduce a scalable, model-agnostic framework that assesses temporal behavior using motion vectors (MVs) extracted directly from compressed video streams. Codec-generated MVs from standards such as H.264 and HEVC provide lightweight, resolution-consistent descriptors of motion dynamics. We quantify realism by computing Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, and Wasserstein divergences between MV statistics of real and generated videos. Experiments on the GenVidBench dataset containing videos from eight state-of-the-art generators reveal systematic discrepancies from real motion: entropy-based divergences rank Pika and SVD as closest to real videos, MV-sum statistics favor VC2 and Text2Video-Zero, and CogVideo shows the largest deviations across both measures. Visualizations of MV fields and class-conditional motion heatmaps further reveal center bias, sparse and piecewise constant flows, and grid-like artifacts that frame-level metrics do not capture. Beyond evaluation, we investigate MV-RGB fusion through channel concatenation, cross-attention, joint embedding, and a motion-aware fusion module. Incorporating MVs improves downstream classification across ResNet, I3D, and TSN backbones, with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 reaching up to 97.4% accuracy and I3D achieving 99.0% accuracy on real-versus-generated discrimination. These findings demonstrate that compressed-domain MVs provide an effective temporal signal for diagnosing motion defects in generative videos and for strengthening temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u51cf\u5c11Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9", "motivation": "Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u97f3\u9891\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6216\u8f6c\u5f55\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3", "method": "1. \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(ALA)\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u5757\u8868\u793a\uff1b2. \u591a\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f(KD)\uff1a\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u97f3\u9891\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5904\u7406\u5e72\u51c0\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50", "result": "\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u8bed\u97f3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5e72\u51c0\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "ALA\u548cKD\u4e3a\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8Whisper\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7b56\u7565"}}

These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2.

This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations.

Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a \"Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason\" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment.

In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data.

Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6539\u5199\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u7ecf\u5178CSPLib\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5LLMs\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u7406\u89e3\u8f83\u6d45\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u9a8cLLMs\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5426\u6e90\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8bb8\u591a\u6807\u51c6CP\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u80fd\u5df2\u5305\u542b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u4e00\u7ec4\u77e5\u540dCSPLib\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u53d8\u4f46\u4fee\u6539\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8bef\u5bfc\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027LLM\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6d45\u5c42\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5bf9\u63aa\u8f9e\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6210\u529f\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u591a\u6e90\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8ff0\u53d8\u5316\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8106\u5f31\u3002"}}

Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images. This field is a function parameterized by the trained network, and its segmentation is realized by the watershed method. The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries. A single tensor is all that is needed to train a \\unet\\ thus simplifying implementation, lowering training and inference times, hence reducing energy consumption, and requiring a small memory footprint, all attractive features in edge computing.

This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization.

We present EchoAgent, a framework that enables structured, interpretable automation for this domain. Methods: EchoAgent orchestrates specialized vision tools under Large Language Model (LLM) control to perform temporal localization, spatial measurement, and clinical interpretation. A key contribution is a measurement-feasibility prediction model that determines whether anatomical structures are reliably measurable in each frame, enabling autonomous tool selection. We curated a benchmark of diverse, clinically validated video-query pairs for evaluation. Results: EchoAgent achieves accurate, interpretable results despite added complexity of spatiotemporal video analysis.

We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\\%/90\\%/88\\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically.

Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., \"lift hands more to generate more power\" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art.

Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness.

This technique enhances anatomical detail and soft tissue differentiation, which is vital for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, inherent contrasts disparities between modalities pose fundamental challenges in effectively utilizing reference image textures to guide target image reconstruction, often resulting in suboptimal feature integration. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prompt expert network based on a convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) strategy for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce an iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, thereby reducing redundancy and interference. To fully integrate these features, a novel dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) is proposed. This module uses a frequency prompt to guide the selection of relevant reference features for incorporation into the target image, while an adaptive routing prompt determines the optimal method for fusing reference and target features to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details.

In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks.

While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.\n  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.\n  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding.

Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design.

A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%.

These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking.

Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.", "AI": {"tldr": "LINGUAL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u7ea680%\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u91cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "LINGUAL\u6846\u67b6\u63a5\u6536\u4e13\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u76f8\u5e94\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5e8f\u5217\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cLINGUAL\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea680%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.", "AI": {"tldr": "WaRPAD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7f29\u653e\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6765\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u548cAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5728RandomResizedCrop\u7b49\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u81f4\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0cWaRPAD\u9996\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9Haar\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u65b9\u5411\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u88c1\u526a\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u7f29\u653e\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u500d\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u6210\u5c0f\u5757\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5757\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5757\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u53d6\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u5230\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c23\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cWaRPAD\u59cb\u7ec8\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u635f\u574f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "WaRPAD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7531\u4e8eRandomResizedCrop\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u662f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u8de8\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models.

Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability.

Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information.

This dependency on \"big data\" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.\n  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification.

We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured \"Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train\" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation).

To address this, we present SMGeo, a promptable end-to-end transformer-based model for object Geo-localization. This model supports click prompting and can output object Geo-localization in real time when prompted to allow for interactive use. The model employs a fully transformer-based architecture, utilizing a Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding of both drone and satellite imagery and an anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression. In order to better capture both inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, we introduce a grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) into the cross-view encoder, allowing it to adaptively activate specialized experts according to the content, scale and source of each grid. We also employ an anchor-free detection head for coordinate regression, directly predicting object locations via heat-map supervision in the reference images. This approach avoids scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes.

However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image.

While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing.

Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MP-PVIR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u884c\u4eba-\u8f66\u8f86\u4e8b\u6545\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ea\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e8b\u6545\u662f\u5426\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4e8b\u6545\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba4\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6574\u5408\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u91c7\u96c6\u2192\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5272\u2192\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5b9a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u63a8\u7406\u2192\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528TG-VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5272\uff0cPhaVR-VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "TG-VLM\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230mIoU=0.4881\uff0cPhaVR-VLM\u5728\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u5f97\u520633.063\uff0c\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe64.70%\uff0c\u5728Woven Traffic Safety\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "MP-PVIR\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u8f66\u8def\u534f\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts.

However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system.

We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields.

However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features.

However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \\textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2\u00b0 while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe).

Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training.

However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MVI-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5305\u542b1,248\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684VQA\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86MVI-Sensitivity\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5e7b\u89c9\u6216\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u7c7b\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\u548c1,248\u4e2aVQA\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MVI-Sensitivity\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5bf918\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MVI-Bench\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively.

Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization.

While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene.

These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process.

Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97.

This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training.

We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71.

Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications.

This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models.

Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy.

Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers.

In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation.

Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043).

Project webpage: https://github.com/lillian039/VARC", "summary": "The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is designed to promote research on abstract reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the problem from a vision-centric perspective. In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a \"canvas\" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results.

Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. A dedicated auxiliary learning network is designed to actively adapt and learn from perturbed information. Notably, APS is model agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual.

We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge.

However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks.

However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model.

To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors.

We then conduct an empirical study to explore the intrinsic attributes from perspectives of visual styles and semantic contents in intermediate domain proxies. Reaping benefits from these attributes of intermediate domains, we develop a fast domain alignment method to use these proxies as learning guidance for target domain feature transformation.

During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68\u00b0/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88\u00b0/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79\u00b0/2.45 mm on SpineDepth.

However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDiff-NAF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u8870\u51cf\u573a\u548c\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2CT\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u591a\u6e90\u9759\u6001CT\u5728\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u8870\u51cf\u573a\u8868\u793a\u548c\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u89d2\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6295\u5f71\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6269\u6563\u9a71\u52a8\u91cd\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df3D CT\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6295\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cDiff-NAF\u5728\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "Diff-NAF\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6"}}

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases.

Benefiting from the residual connections, modern neural networks can scale up to more than one hundred layers and enjoy wide success. However, as networks continue to deepen, current architectures often struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements, calling for more advanced designs to further unleash the potential of deeper networks. In this paper, we identify two key barriers that obstruct residual models from scaling deeper: shortcut degradation and limited width. Shortcut degradation hinders deep-layer learning, while the inherent depth-width trade-off imposes limited width. To mitigate these issues, we propose a generalized residual architecture dubbed Step by Step Network (StepsNet) to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models. Specifically, we separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width. The resulting method mitigates the two identified problems and serves as a versatile macro design applicable to various models. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms residual models across diverse tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling. These results position StepsNet as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faStep by Step Network (StepsNet)\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6377\u5f84\u9000\u5316\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u9053\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u6b8b\u5dee\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u67b6\u6784\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u4e34\u6377\u5f84\u9000\u5316\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u4e24\u4e2a\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u91ca\u653e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStepsNet\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6cbf\u901a\u9053\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5806\u53e0\u5bbd\u5ea6\u9012\u589e\u7684\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6377\u5f84\u9000\u5316\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "StepsNet\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b8b\u5dee\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u91ca\u653e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions.

These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement.

Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level.

However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score.

However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects.

In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faJFD3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u57df\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6a21\u7cca\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ea2\u5916\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u5e38\u56e0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5feb\u901f\u79fb\u52a8\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6743\u91cd\u5171\u4eab\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6e05\u6670\u5206\u652f\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u7cca\u5206\u652f\uff1a1)\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u6062\u590d\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u6e05\u6670\u5206\u652f\u7279\u5f81\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u7cca\u5206\u652f\uff1b2)\u9891\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6d45\u5c42\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c42\uff1b3)\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u7cca\u5206\u652f\u903c\u8fd1\u6e05\u6670\u5206\u652f\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b30,000\u5f20\u6a21\u62df\u548c4,118\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u7ea2\u5916\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6a21\u7cca\u56fe\u50cf\u7684IRBlurUAV\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cJFD3\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "JFD3\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u57df\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

However, the literature on automated quality assessment offers few quantitative methods for evaluating this specific attribute. This paper proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to address this gap. The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples.

However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions.

Project website: https://bedlam2.is.tue.mpg.de", "summary": "Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates.

Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating \"knowledge islands\" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts.

To explore the ecological advantages of such staged \"visual diets\", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines.

While event cameras offer potential solutions with superior low-light sensitivity and high temporal resolution, existing fusion methods typically employ staged strategies, limiting their effectiveness against combined low-light and motion blur degradations. To overcome this, we propose CompEvent, a complex neural network framework enabling holistic full-process fusion of event data and RGB frames for enhanced joint restoration. CompEvent features two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU, which utilizes complex-valued convolutions and processes video and event streams iteratively via GRU to achieve temporal alignment and continuous fusion; and 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module, which performs unified complex-valued signal processing in both spatial and frequency domains, facilitating deep fusion through spatial structures and system-level characteristics. By leveraging the holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompEvent outperforms SOTA methods in addressing this challenging task.

We propose a physics-guided residual learning framework that predicts bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior and reconstructs bed from the observed surface. A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a standard encoder (e.g.,ResNet-50) is trained with lightweight physics and data terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, a ramped prior-consistency term, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map.

The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space.

However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments.

Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, Parameter Aware Mamba Model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multi-task learning setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4).

However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features.

However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks.

An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes.

We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u7269\u4f53\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u7269\u4f53\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u76f8\u4e92\u906e\u6321\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u7cca\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u60013D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u60013D-GS\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7684\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7269\u4f53\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniZip\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891token\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u97f3\u9891token\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u97f3\u9891\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u6570\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891token\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b03.42\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u548c1.4\u500d\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u97f3\u89c6\u9891token\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709token\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u6a21\u6001token\u8054\u5408\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u97f3\u9891token\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u97f3\u9891\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u6570\u6355\u6349\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891token\u526a\u679d\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u9519\u65f6\u7a7a\u65b9\u6848\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u9891token\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u9876\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b03.42\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u548c1.4\u500d\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniZip\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u97f3\u89c6\u9891token\u8054\u5408\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines.

Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation.

Project page: https://miya-oi.github.io/SparseSurf-project", "summary": "Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \\net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision.

This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles.

Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a training-free approach that leverages video Diffusion Transformers pretrained at their native scale to synthesize higher resolution videos without any additional training or adaptation. At the core of our method lies an inward sliding window attention mechanism, which originates from a key observation: maintaining each query token's training scale receptive field is crucial for preserving visual fidelity and detail. However, naive local window attention, unfortunately, often leads to repetitive content and exhibits a lack of global coherence in the generated results. To overcome this challenge, we devise a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with a novel cross-attention override strategy, enabling the semantic content produced by local attention to be guided by another branch with a full receptive field and, therefore, ensuring holistic consistency. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we incorporate a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid the frequent computation of full 3D attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency in a training-free paradigm.

This modular design is computationally inefficient, leads to suboptimal performance, and prevents the unification of diffusion with the single-network architectures common in vision foundation models. Our goal is to unify these three components into a single, end-to-end trainable network. We first demonstrate that a naive joint training approach fails catastrophically due to ``latent collapse'', where the diffusion training objective interferes with the network's ability to learn a good latent representation. We identify the root causes of this instability by drawing a novel analogy between diffusion and self-distillation based unsupervised learning method. Based on this insight, we propose Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD), a new framework with key modifications to the training objective that stabilize the latent space. This approach enables, for the first time, the stable end-to-end training of a single network that simultaneously learns to encode, decode, and perform diffusion. DSD achieves outstanding performance on the ImageNet $256\\times 256$ conditional generation task: FID=13.44/6.38/4.25 with only 42M/118M/205M parameters and 50 training epochs on ImageNet, without using classifier-free-guidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDSD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728ImageNet 256\u00d7256\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u67b6\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u6b21\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5355\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7edf\u4e00\u3002\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u7edf\u4e00\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6269\u6563\u7f51\u7edc\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u84b8\u998f(DSD)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u4e2a\u7f51\u7edc\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet 256\u00d7256\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97FID=13.44/6.38/4.25\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752842M/118M/205M\u53c2\u6570\u548c50\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u81ea\u7531\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "DSD\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5355\u7f51\u7edc\u7edf\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

In fact, the intricate geometry of 3D urban environments results in high degrees of occlusion and requires extensive manual viewpoint adjustments that make large-scale exploration inefficient. To address this, we propose a view-based approach for 3D data exploration, where a vector field encodes views from the environment. To support this approach, we introduce a neural field-based method that constructs an efficient implicit representation of 3D environments. This representation enables both faster direct queries, which consist of the computation of view assessment indices, and inverse queries, which help avoid occlusion and facilitate the search for views that match desired data patterns. Our approach supports key urban analysis tasks such as visibility assessments, solar exposure evaluation, and assessing the visual impact of new developments. We validate our method through quantitative experiments, case studies informed by real-world urban challenges, and feedback from domain experts.

We demonstrate that classical computer vision models trained on refined high-reliability subsets and enhanced with our curriculum strategy show improvements, highlighting benefits of addressing label subjectivity with VLMs. This method surpasses prior state of the art across engagement benchmarks such as EngageNet (three of six feature settings, maximum improvement of +1.21%), and DREAMS / PAFE with F1 gains of +0.22 / +0.06.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLMs)\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u4e3b\u89c2\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u5377\u63d0\u53d6\u884c\u4e3a\u7ebf\u7d22\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u96c6\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u4e34\u4e3b\u89c2\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u7b7e\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528VLMs\u4f18\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u5377\u63d0\u53d6\u884c\u4e3a\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u5206\u4e3a\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5b50\u96c6\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u7cca\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u76d1\u7763\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728EngageNet\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff086\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u76843\u4e2a\uff09\u6700\u5927\u63d0\u5347+1.21%\uff0c\u5728DREAMS/PAFE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2dF1\u5f97\u5206\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347+0.22/+0.06\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528VLMs\u5904\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u7cbe\u70bc\u7684\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
