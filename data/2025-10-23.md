### [1] [A Reduced-Dimensional Model for the Interhemispheric Geostrophic Meridional Overturning Circulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19454)
*Elian Vanderborght,Henk A. Dijkstra*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 开发了一个包含关键观测特征的简化全球翻转环流模型，该模型整合了地转平衡、边界增强的跨等密度面混合和南大洋绝热上升流，能够解释经向温度差异的形成机制和跨赤道地转流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往简化模型忽略了三个关键观测特征：地转平衡下的经向翻转环流、边界增强的跨等密度面混合和南大洋绝热上升流，需要开发能一致整合这些特征的模型。

Method: 基于Callies和Marotzke (2012)的方法，在纬度-深度空间中模拟半封闭海盆东部和西部边界的温度，海盆南部连接纬向周期性通道。

Result: 模型阐明了纬向温度差异通过绝热和扩散过程形成并维持的机制，产生了地转全球翻转环流，与三维海洋模型和理论标度律有良好一致性。

Conclusion: 该简化模型适合长期积分探索极端强迫情景下的全球翻转环流响应，并为测试涡旋和混合参数化提供了有用框架。

Abstract: The Global Overturning Circulation (GOC) is a key component of the climate
system, transporting heat, carbon, and salt throughout the global ocean.
Previous reduced-dimensional models have sought to represent this
three-dimensional circulation but often neglected three key observational
features: (1) the meridional overturning circulation is in geostrophic balance
below the Ekman layer, (2) diapycnal mixing is strongly enhanced near ocean
boundaries, and (3) upwelling is partly driven by adiabatic dynamics in the
Southern Ocean. Building on Callies and Marotzke (2012), we develop a reduced
model that consistently incorporates all three by simulating temperature in
latitude-depth space along the eastern and western boundaries of a
semi-enclosed basin connected in the south to a zonally periodic re-entrant
channel. The model clarifies how zonal temperature differences in the basin
arise and are maintained through adiabatic and diffusive processes, giving rise
to the geostrophic GOC. It also provides a transparent framework for
understanding how geostrophic currents cross the equator to form the
interhemispheric overturning, and how boundary-intensified mixing and Southern
Ocean winds regulate polar downwelling rates. The reduced model shows good
agreement with both a three-dimensional ocean model and theoretical scaling
laws for stratification and overturning strength. Owing to its simplicity, it
is well suited for long integrations exploring the GOC response under extreme
forcing scenarios and offers a useful framework for testing eddy and mixing
parameterizations.

### [2] [A flexible framework for structural plasticity in GPU-accelerated sparse spiking neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19764)
*James C. Knight,Johanna Senk,Thomas Nowotny*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种支持GPU加速结构可塑性的新框架，用于训练稀疏脉冲神经网络，相比密集网络训练时间减少10倍，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物大脑中的结构可塑性（创建和移除连接）对有效学习、损伤恢复和资源优化至关重要，而当前机器学习框架主要关注突触可塑性，且优化的是密集连接，无法减少大型模型的训练成本。

Method: 基于GeNN模拟器开发了GPU加速的结构可塑性框架，首先使用e-prop监督学习规则和DEEP R训练稀疏SNN分类器，然后在无监督学习环境中学习拓扑图。

Result: 稀疏分类器相比基线密集模型训练时间减少高达10倍，DEEP R重连使其性能与原始模型相当；实现了超实时模拟的拓扑图形成，并提供了连接演化的洞察。

Conclusion: 该框架将促进在网络结构和神经通信中实现和维持稀疏性的进一步研究，以及探索稀疏性在各种神经形态应用中的计算优势。

Abstract: The majority of research in both training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
and modeling learning in biological brains focuses on synaptic plasticity,
where learning equates to changing the strength of existing connections.
However, in biological brains, structural plasticity - where new connections
are created and others removed - is also vital, not only for effective learning
but also for recovery from damage and optimal resource usage. Inspired by
structural plasticity, pruning is often used in machine learning to remove weak
connections from trained models to reduce the computational requirements of
inference. However, the machine learning frameworks typically used for
backpropagation-based training of both ANNs and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
are optimized for dense connectivity, meaning that pruning does not help reduce
the training costs of ever-larger models. The GeNN simulator already supports
efficient GPU-accelerated simulation of sparse SNNs for computational
neuroscience and machine learning. Here, we present a new flexible framework
for implementing GPU-accelerated structural plasticity rules and demonstrate
this first using the e-prop supervised learning rule and DEEP R to train
efficient, sparse SNN classifiers and then, in an unsupervised learning
context, to learn topographic maps. Compared to baseline dense models, our
sparse classifiers reduce training time by up to 10x while the DEEP R rewiring
enables them to perform as well as the original models. We demonstrate
topographic map formation in faster-than-realtime simulations, provide insights
into the connectivity evolution, and measure simulation speed versus network
size. The proposed framework will enable further research into achieving and
maintaining sparsity in network structure and neural communication, as well as
exploring the computational benefits of sparsity in a range of neuromorphic
applications.

*Nathan Mankovich,Kai-Hendrik Cohrs,Homer Durand,Vasileios Sitokonstantinou,Tristan Williams,Gustau Camps-Valls*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文综述了维度降维技术在地球观测数据中的应用，旨在解决高维数据带来的稀疏性、效率低下和维度灾难问题，提升机器学习模型在环境监测、城市规划等领域的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测数据量日益增长，自动信息提取对解决社会、经济和环境挑战至关重要。但高维数据带来的稀疏性、效率低下和维度灾难问题限制了机器学习模型的有效性。

Method: 通过维度降维技术，特别是特征提取方法，在保持数据关键特性的同时降低复杂度，提升数据压缩、清洗、融合、可视化、异常检测和预测等任务的效果。

Result: 为遥感数据价值链中的维度降维应用提供了手册式指导，识别了尚未充分探索的维度降维算法及其在未来研究中的应用机会。

Conclusion: 维度降维技术是解决地球观测高维数据挑战的关键工具，未来研究应关注更多未充分探索的维度降维算法及其应用潜力。

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [4] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes是一种神经生成的基准标记，能够自然地融入现实环境，通过微小视觉修改实现隐蔽的6自由度位置追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准标记在美学上过于显眼，在某些应用场景中不受欢迎，需要开发能够隐蔽融入环境的追踪标记。

Method: 使用端到端深度学习流程，包括编码器网络将任意图像转换为Ninja Codes，通过联合训练多个网络模块实现创建和检测。

Result: 实验表明Ninja Codes在常见室内光照条件下能提供可靠的位置追踪，同时成功隐藏在各种环境纹理中。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes在需要隐蔽追踪的场景中具有重要价值，可使用普通彩色打印机和RGB相机进行部署。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [5] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段视觉语言问答系统，用于自动驾驶中的感知、预测和规划问题，通过精心设计的提示和上下文增强显著提升了问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶中高层次感知、预测和规划问题的视觉语言问答，利用预训练视觉语言模型但需要更好的提示工程和上下文增强。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用大型多模态LLM（Qwen2.5-VL-32B），输入六摄像头数据、历史时间窗口和思维链提示；第二阶段增强场景元数据和任务特定指令。采用自一致性集成提高可靠性。

Result: 在驾驶QA基准测试中显著优于基线模型：第一阶段使用5帧历史和10-shot提示达到65.1%准确率，自一致性提升至66.85%；第二阶段达到67.37%。在严重视觉干扰下仍保持96%准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示工程和上下文增强可以大幅提升预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的性能。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [6] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D模型，用于解决纵向医学图像分析中高分辨率图像序列在非均匀时间间隔下的建模挑战，在乳腺癌风险预测任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向医学图像分析面临核心数据挑战：如何有效建模高分辨率图像序列在非均匀时间间隔下的时空信息。现有方法要么压缩空间信息，要么使用计算效率低且不兼容非均匀时间步的时空模型。

Method: 开发了Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D状态空间架构，包含连续时间选择性扫描机制（显式整合检查间真实时间差）和多尺度3D邻域融合模块（鲁棒捕获时空关系）。

Result: 在乳腺癌风险预测基准测试中，验证c-index提升2-5个百分点，1-5年AUC得分均高于现有的循环、transformer和状态空间模型变体。

Conclusion: 该模型凭借线性复杂度能高效处理长而复杂的乳腺筛查历史，为纵向图像分析提供了新框架。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

### [7] [MoAlign: Motion-Centric Representation Alignment for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19022)
*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种运动中心对齐框架，通过从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，并将其与文本到视频扩散模型的特征对齐，以生成更合理、时间一致的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型在生成时间一致且物理合理的运动方面存在不足，主要原因是模型对复杂运动的理解不够充分。现有方法通过将扩散模型特征与预训练视频编码器特征对齐，但这些编码器的特征混合了视频外观和动态，限制了对齐效果。

Method: 提出运动中心对齐框架：1）从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，该子空间通过预测真实光流进行优化以确保捕捉真实运动动态；2）将文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征与这个新子空间对齐，使生成模型能够内化运动知识。

Result: 该方法在VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench和VBench-2.0等基准测试上进行了实证评估，并进行了用户研究，结果表明该方法提高了最先进视频扩散模型的物理常识性，同时保持了与文本提示的契合度。

Conclusion: 所提出的运动中心对齐框架能够有效提升文本到视频扩散模型生成视频的时间一致性和物理合理性，为视频生成任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [8] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh是一个用于详细图像描述的评估指标，它使用场景图作为结构化标准来指导LLMs作为评判者，产生基于细粒度错误的聚合分数。该方法在DOCENT数据集上比现有指标更好地与人类评分相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标准评估指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本描述中的属性、关系错误。需要一种能够定位特定文本跨度错误的新评估方法。

Method: PoSh使用场景图作为结构化标准，指导LLMs作为评判者来评估详细图像描述。同时引入了DOCENT数据集，包含艺术作品、专家撰写的参考描述以及模型生成的描述，并由艺术史学生进行质量评估。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上与人类判断的相关性比最佳开源替代方案强0.05 Spearman ρ，对图像类型具有鲁棒性，并且能够作为有效的奖励函数，优于标准监督微调。

Conclusion: PoSh和DOCENT为详细图像描述提供了更好的评估框架，发现基础模型在描述具有丰富场景动态的图像时难以实现完整、无错误的覆盖，这为VLM进展设定了一个具有挑战性的新任务。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

*Zhongyu Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Lei Li,Zhuoran Zhou,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了UniHPR，一个统一的人体姿态表示学习框架，通过新颖的基于奇异值的对比学习损失来对齐图像、2D和3D人体姿态嵌入，在人体姿态估计任务中取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态融合和生成应用中，人体姿态表示对许多下游任务至关重要，但目前缺乏对图像、2D关键点、3D骨架等多种姿态表示之间相关性的系统研究。

Method: 提出UniHPR统一人体姿态表示学习框架，使用基于奇异值的对比学习损失来同时对齐多种数据表示，包括图像、2D和3D人体姿态。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上MPJPE达到49.9mm，在3DPW数据集上PA-MPJPE达到51.6mm（跨域评估），同时在Human3.6M数据集上实现2D和3D姿态检索，检索误差为9.24mm MPJPE。

Conclusion: UniHPR能够有效对齐多种人体姿态表示，在人体姿态估计和姿态检索任务中表现出色，证明了统一表示学习的有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

*Eyad Gad,Seif Soliman,M. Saeed Darweesh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出将注意力机制集成到3D U-Net模型中，以改进脑肿瘤分割性能，特别是在处理不规则形状和模糊边界时。同时使用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法来解决训练数据不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准U-Net模型在脑肿瘤分割中难以准确描绘不规则形状和模糊边界区域，且高分辨率MRI数据训练需要大量计算资源并面临类别不平衡问题。

Method: 在3D U-Net模型中集成注意力机制，使模型能够捕捉复杂细节并优先处理信息丰富的区域。同时采用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法来解决训练数据不平衡问题。

Result: 在BraTS 2020数据集上的评估结果显示，模型表现优于相关研究，dice系数达0.975，特异性0.988，敏感性0.995。

Conclusion: 提出的模型有效提升了脑肿瘤分割性能，为临床环境中的可靠诊断提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

TL;DR: 该研究应用联邦近端方法(FedProx)处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据集，结合改进的U-Net模型和注意力机制，在保护患者隐私的同时提高了肿瘤分割准确性，达到96%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是女性主要死因，需要早期检测和准确诊断。超声成像虽可靠且成本效益高，但医疗数据的敏感性使得开发准确且保护隐私的AI模型具有挑战性。联邦学习是解决方案，但非独立同分布数据会影响模型准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 应用联邦近端(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布超声乳腺癌图像数据集，结合改进的U-Net模型和注意力机制来增强肿瘤分割准确性。

Result: 该方法训练出的全局模型达到96%的准确率，证明了在保护患者隐私的同时有效提高肿瘤分割准确性。

Conclusion: FedProx有潜力成为在非独立同分布本地医疗数据集上训练精确机器学习模型的有前景方法。

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

*Yunzhe Wang,Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和CECL方法，用于研究复杂3D环境中的多智能体决策，通过同步的第一人称视角视频流促进团队战术意识学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解研究主要依赖第三人称视角，忽视了多智能体学习的同步性和自我中心特性，需要从个体视角理解团队战术。

Method: 构建X-Ego-CS数据集（124小时专业级CS2比赛视频），提出跨自我中心对比学习（CECL）方法，对齐队友的第一人称视觉流以培养团队战术意识。

Result: 在队友-对手位置预测任务中，CECL方法能有效增强智能体从单一第一人称视角推断队友和对手位置的能力。

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为电子竞技中的跨自我中心多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

*Warisa Nusrat,Mostafijur Rahman,Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文使用六种深度卷积网络对疟疾细胞图像进行分类，其中残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最佳，准确率分别达到97.28%和97.55%，证明了深度学习在疟疾自动检测中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疟疾主要通过雌性按蚊传播，常导致0-5岁儿童死亡。传统显微镜观察血涂片图像的方法依赖人工判断，容易因专业知识不足和人为因素导致误诊，因此需要计算机辅助的自动诊断系统。

Method: 应用六种深度卷积网络（AlexNet、XceptionNet、VGG-19、残差注意力网络、DenseNet-121和自定义CNN）从血细胞图像中提取深层特征，并分类为疟疾感染细胞或健康细胞。

Result: 在公开的疟疾细胞图像数据集上，残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最好，平均准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现高度支持深度学习驱动的方法在疟疾自动可靠检测中的实际应用，同时最大限度地减少了直接人工参与。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PruneHal是一种无需训练的方法，通过自适应KV缓存修剪来增强MLLMs对关键视觉信息的关注，从而减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么引入额外数据进行训练，要么在推理时引入外部或内部信息，这些方法都会带来额外的计算成本。研究发现MLLMs中的幻觉与对视觉令牌关注不足密切相关。

Method: 提出PruneHal方法，利用自适应KV缓存修剪来增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注，该方法无需训练且几乎不增加推理成本。

Result: 在多个主流MLLMs和广泛使用的幻觉评估基准上测试，取得了稳健且出色的结果。

Conclusion: PruneHal是首个将令牌修剪应用于MLLMs幻觉缓解的方法，具有模型无关性，并能与不同的解码策略无缝集成。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Video Consistency Distance (VCD)度量标准，通过基于奖励的微调框架增强视频扩散模型的时间一致性，特别针对图像到视频生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的奖励函数主要关注整个生成视频序列的质量，但在图像到视频生成任务中，时间一致性往往受到影响，需要专门的方法来改善这一性能。

Method: 在视频帧特征的频率空间中定义VCD度量，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧信息，并将其集成到基于奖励的微调框架中。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上的实验结果表明，使用VCD微调的视频生成模型显著增强了时间一致性，且不降低其他性能。

Conclusion: VCD是一种有效的度量标准，能够专门针对时间一致性进行优化，为视频生成模型提供了改进时间连贯性的新方法。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive是一个用于增强自动驾驶下游感知任务的新型合成数据生成框架，通过3D感知引导图和3D资产渲染生成多视角逼真视频，显著提升异常情况感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型主要关注生成质量和可控性指标，但忽视了对于自动驾驶性能至关重要的下游感知任务评估。现有的预训练+微调策略需要两倍训练周期，当基线模型也使用双倍周期时，合成数据的优势变得不明显。

Method: 首先将输入视频分解为多个3D感知引导图，然后将3D资产渲染到这些引导图上，最后微调驾驶世界模型以生成经过编辑的多视角逼真视频，用于训练下游感知模型。

Result: Dream4Drive能够大规模生成多视角异常情况，显著提升自动驾驶中的异常情况感知能力。同时贡献了DriveObj3D大规模3D资产数据集，覆盖典型驾驶场景类别。

Conclusion: 实验表明Dream4Drive在各种训练周期下都能有效提升下游感知模型的性能，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了强大的合成数据增强方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MoE-GS框架，将混合专家技术引入动态高斯泼溅，通过体积感知像素路由器自适应融合多个专家输出，提升渲染质量，并通过效率优化和蒸馏策略解决模型容量增加的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法在不同场景下表现不一致，没有单一方法能有效处理所有动态挑战，需要更统一的框架来提升性能。

Method: 使用混合专家框架，通过体积感知像素路由器将高斯级权重投影到像素空间进行自适应融合，并采用单次多专家渲染、门控感知高斯剪枝和蒸馏策略来优化效率。

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上的实验表明，MoE-GS在保持效率的同时，持续优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MoE-GS是首个将混合专家技术应用于动态高斯泼溅的方法，通过专家集成和效率优化，实现了更好的渲染质量和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

TL;DR: SFGFusion是一种基于表面拟合的相机-4D成像雷达检测网络，通过估计物体二次表面参数增强空间表示和跨模态交互，生成密集伪点云缓解雷达点稀疏性，在BEV空间实现多模态融合，在TJ4DRadSet和VoD数据集上取得优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D成像雷达具有低成本、长距离检测和准确速度测量等优势，但其稀疏点云和低分辨率限制了物体几何表示并阻碍多模态融合。

Method: 通过估计图像和雷达数据的二次表面参数，使用显式表面拟合模型增强空间表示；预测的深度用于图像分支的PV到BEV转换和生成密集伪点云；采用基于pillar的方法处理点云，在BEV空间进行多模态融合。

Result: 在TJ4RadSet和view-of-delft对象检测基准测试中，SFGFusion有效融合相机和4D雷达特征，实现了优越的性能。

Conclusion: SFGFusion通过表面拟合引导的多模态融合方法，成功解决了4D成像雷达点云稀疏性问题，提升了3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

TL;DR: FadeLead是一个前景感知框架，通过将背景上下文信息封装到紧凑的前景特征中，在带宽受限的车联网中实现高效的协作感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车联网带宽限制下，传统前景中心方法丢弃背景上下文信息的问题，背景信息对感知性能至关重要。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，早期利用背景线索但逐步剪除，迫使模型将上下文信息内化到前景表示中，而不传输背景本身。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试中，FadeLead在不同带宽设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 上下文丰富的前景共享在协作感知中具有显著效果，FadeLead框架能有效克服带宽限制下的信息损失问题。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Motivation: 现有MAV动作识别方法依赖计算密集型模型，不适合资源受限的MAV平台，需要在识别精度和推理速度之间进行权衡。

Method: 采用MobileNetV4作为主干网络，引入阶段式正交知识蒸馏(SOKD)策略，集成参数自由注意力机制，开发混合损失训练策略。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能使用可微的回归模型作为计数网络，无法利用检测器模型更优越的计数能力，因为检测器的枚举计数本质是不可微的。

Method: 设计自定义激活函数将检测器logits转换为软二元指示器，在推理时优化预训练T2I模型的噪声先验。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升了对象计数准确率（如D2D-Small基准上提升13.7%），且图像质量和计算开销影响很小。

Conclusion: D2D框架成功克服了检测器模型不可微的限制，有效提升了文本到图像生成模型的数值准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled
data, the complexity of the disease, and the constraints related to data
privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data
in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the
framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an
ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The
effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle
Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and
99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant
state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior
accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications
in early Alzheimer disease detection.

applications spanning industrial automation, physical rehabilitation, education
and human-robot collaboration. This paper reviews vision-based methods for
detecting and predicting mistakes in structured tasks, focusing on procedural
and executional errors. By leveraging advancements in computer vision,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出统一强化与模仿学习(RIL)算法，通过结合强化学习和对抗模仿学习，训练轻量级视觉语言模型，使其性能接近甚至超越大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)虽然取得了显著进展，但其大规模特性使其在资源受限环境中不实用。需要开发高效的训练算法来创建强大的轻量级VLMs。

Method: RIL算法独特地结合了强化学习和对抗模仿学习的优势。使用基于LLM的判别器区分学生和教师模型输出，并利用多个大型教师VLMs提供多样化学习指导。

Result: 在多样化的视觉语言基准测试中，RIL显著缩小了与最先进开源和闭源VLMs的性能差距，并在多个实例中超越了它们。

Conclusion: 统一的强化与模仿学习策略使学生模型实现了显著的性能提升，使其能够与领先的闭源VLMs竞争。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，通过同时预测水深和海底分类，利用任务间的协同效应，显著提升了浅水环境测绘的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将水深估计和海底分类作为独立任务处理，忽略了它们之间的相互促进作用，限制了深度学习方法在浅水测绘中的广泛应用。

Method: 采用双分支编码器分别处理水深估计和像素级海底分类，通过注意力特征融合模块和窗口化Swin-Transformer融合块整合跨任务特征，并使用动态任务不确定性加权平衡目标。

Conclusion: 联合建模水深与海底底质和栖息地能够产生协同增益，为集成浅水测绘提供了一个鲁棒的开源解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP提出了一种参数高效的多层融合方法，通过将fMRI信号与CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，无需单独的VAE管道即可实现竞争性的图像解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将fMRI映射到CLIP的最终语义层，忽略了CLIP中间层的丰富物体信息，且与大脑功能层次结构不符。许多方法添加参数密集的VAE管道来捕获视觉细节，但这种方法效率低下。

Method: BrainMCLIP采用参数高效的多层融合方法，将功能不同的视觉区域（低/高级）的fMRI信号与对应的CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，尊重功能层次结构。引入交叉重建策略和新的多粒度损失函数。

Result: BrainMCLIP实现了高度竞争的性能，特别是在高级语义指标上匹配或超越包括使用VAE管道的最先进方法。参数数量减少了71.7%，无需VAE管道。

Conclusion: 通过利用CLIP中间特征，BrainMCLIP有效捕获了CLIP-only方法常遗漏的视觉细节，在语义准确性和细节保真度之间实现了良好平衡，无需单独的VAE管道。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在无需训练的情况下实现有效、灵活和可泛化的开集图像分割与识别的能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型通常以原生或高分辨率处理图像，导致视觉token占总token的97-99%，造成高计算成本和延迟，即使低分辨率图像已足够。

Conclusion: CARES通过智能选择最小足够分辨率，有效解决了VLM中视觉token过多导致的计算效率问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Motivation: 随着NeRF在3D场景表示和新视角合成中的广泛应用，保护其知识产权免受未经授权使用变得至关重要。

Method: 提出AegisRF框架，包含扰动场和敏感度场。扰动场在NeRF预渲染输出中注入对抗性扰动，敏感度场学习空间变化的几何扰动敏感度以保持渲染质量。

Result: 实验表明AegisRF在多种下游任务和模态中具有通用性，包括多视图图像分类和基于体素的3D定位，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: AegisRF有效保护了NeRF模型的知识产权，在破坏未经授权使用的同时保持了渲染质量，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态协同学习框架，能够在训练阶段利用多种传感器数据，在推理阶段仅使用单一模态时提升模型性能，适用于地球观测领域的分类和回归任务。

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Motivation: 随着电子商务发展，提高仓库运营效率至关重要。数字孪生技术需要准确收集工人位置，但单摄像头视野有限，需要多摄像头协同感知。

Method: 在仓库天花板安装19个广角摄像头俯视地面，基于地面进行坐标对齐。针对广角镜头边缘失真问题，通过检测工人脚部位置进行对齐，减少图像失真影响。

Conclusion: 基于脚部位置对齐的方法能有效减少广角摄像头失真影响，在多摄像头工人跟踪中取得了显著精度提升。

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性基准XBench，用于评估胸部X射线中跨模态可解释性，发现当前视觉语言模型在医学图像中的定位能力不足，特别是对小病变和弥散病变，需要针对性改进才能临床使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医学图像理解中表现出色，但其定位能力（文本概念与视觉证据的对齐程度）尚未充分探索。在医学领域，可靠的定位对于可解释性和临床采用至关重要。

Method: 使用七种CLIP风格的视觉语言模型变体，通过交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图生成视觉解释，并定量评估其与放射科医生标注区域在多种病理上的对齐程度。

Result: 研究发现：(1)所有模型变体对大型明确病变定位合理，但对小型或弥散病变性能显著下降；(2)在胸部X射线特定数据集上预训练的模型比通用领域训练的模型对齐更好；(3)模型整体识别能力与定位能力强相关。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型尽管识别能力强，但在临床可靠定位方面仍不足，突显了在医学实践中部署前需要针对性可解释性基准测试的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

TL;DR: PICK是一个用于心理图像理解的多步骤框架，专门针对房树人测试，通过层次分析和知识注入来增强多模态大语言模型在心理分析中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在客观感知任务中表现出色，但在主观情感领域如心理分析中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 将多实例绘图分解为语义子图，构建层次表示；分析各层次子图提取心理洞察；引入HTP知识库和特征提取模块生成心理画像；整合多方面信息进行综合评估。

Result: 实验结果表明PICK显著提升了多模态大语言模型在心理分析中的能力，并在情感理解任务中验证了其通用性。

Conclusion: PICK弥合了多模态大语言模型与专业领域之间的差距，为通过视觉表达理解人类心理状态提供了结构化且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

Conclusion: PWM成功统一了世界建模和轨迹规划，通过无动作未来状态预测有效利用世界知识提升规划可靠性。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

TL;DR: 该研究将认知心理学中的视觉搜索范式应用于多模态大语言模型，发现先进模型在颜色和尺寸特征搜索中表现出类似人类的“跳出”效应，但在多特征联合搜索中存在容量限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务上表现优异，但其视觉处理机制不透明。传统黑盒评估主要关注任务准确性，无法揭示底层机制。

Method: 采用认知心理学中的经典视觉搜索范式，通过控制实验测试颜色、尺寸和光照特征，使用针对性微调和机制解释性分析验证发现。

Result: 先进MLLMs在颜色或尺寸的单特征搜索中表现出人类类似的跳出效应，在多特征联合搜索中存在容量限制，并且像人类一样将自然场景先验（如光照方向）整合到对象表示中。

Conclusion: 视觉搜索可以作为认知基础诊断工具，用于评估MLLMs的感知能力，为理解模型视觉处理机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多条件生成对抗网络框架，能够生成具有精确控制属性的代表性孔隙尺度图像，解决了地下表征中的代表性和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决地下表征中孔隙尺度图像代表性不足和自然空间异质性导致子图像偏离核心测量值的问题，同时应对数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 使用多条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)框架，在碳酸盐岩地层的薄片样本上进行训练，同时以孔隙度值和深度参数为条件，在单一统一模型中捕获通用孔隙网络原理和深度特定地质特征。

Result: 模型在所有地层中实现了优异的孔隙度控制(R^2=0.95)，平均绝对误差为0.0099-0.0197，生成图像的代表性误差(1.9-11.3%)远低于随机提取真实子图像的误差(36.4-578%)。

Conclusion: 该框架为地下表征提供了变革性工具，特别适用于碳储存、地热能源和地下水管理等需要了解代表性孔隙空间形态的应用领域。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

Conclusion: 该框架引入了从图像重建到预测性成像的根本性转变，为MRI加速提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

Conclusion: 跨序列模式重用机制对推动领域发展至关重要，将范式从单序列优化转向累积知识学习。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像存在系统性缺失像素（如云层遮挡），这些非随机缺失数据会导致自动化特征提取模型产生表示偏差，特别是在甲烷羽流检测中，模型可能错误地将图像覆盖率与标签关联起来。

Method: 评估了多种插补方法，并提出了一种加权重采样方案，通过在训练期间强制每个覆盖率区间内的类别平衡来消除标签与覆盖率之间的关联。

Result: 结果显示重采样和插补都能显著减少表示偏差，同时不会损害平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。在操作场景中，去偏模型在低覆盖率图像中检测羽流的概率更高。

Conclusion: 通过重采样和插补技术可以有效解决卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提高模型在低覆盖率图像中的检测性能。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理小重叠或无重叠图像对时效果不佳，视频插值生成的中间帧模糊且选择策略效率低，与姿态估计目标不一致。

Method: 提出混合视频生成(HVG)方法，结合视频插值模型和姿态条件新视角合成模型生成清晰中间帧，并使用基于特征对应的特征匹配选择器(FMS)选择适合姿态估计的帧。

Conclusion: PoseCrafter通过改进的中间帧生成和选择策略，有效解决了稀疏重叠图像对的相机姿态估计难题。

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了视觉语言模型在视觉推理任务中的局限性，特别是计数任务，发现模型对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感，通过仅微调输出层可提升准确率高达21%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在下游任务中表现良好，但在视觉推理方面仍存在诸多限制，如识别关系、理解时间序列和计数物体等。本研究旨在深入分析这些失败的根本原因，并提出针对性改进方法。

Method: 在受控实验条件下研究了7个最先进视觉语言模型的计数能力，进行了分层分析，并通过仅微调输出层进行针对性训练。

Result: 实验表明视觉语言模型对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感。分层分析显示错误主要源于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射问题。仅微调输出层可将准确率提升高达21%，并在真实数据集上获得一致改进。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力存在特定局限性，通过针对性微调输出层可显著改善其性能，这为理解模型失败机制和开发更有效的改进策略提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本到图像(T2I)模型中提示复杂度对合成数据质量、多样性和一致性的系统影响，发现增加提示复杂度会降低条件多样性和提示一致性，但减少合成与真实数据的分布偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然T2I模型能生成无限合成数据，但提示工程对数据质量、多样性和一致性的系统影响尚未充分探索，需要研究提示复杂度对这些关键效用指标的影响。

Method: 通过合成实验验证泛化难度，引入新的评估框架比较真实数据和合成数据的效用，在CC12M、ImageNet-1k和DCI等数据集上分析提示复杂度的影响，并评估不同推理时干预方法。

Result: 增加提示复杂度导致条件多样性和提示一致性降低，但减少合成与真实数据的分布偏移。提示扩展方法在图像多样性和美学方面表现最佳，甚至优于真实数据。

Conclusion: 提示复杂度对合成数据效用有显著影响，当前推理时干预方法能在一定程度上增强多样性但会偏离真实数据分布，提示扩展是最有效的干预策略。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

TL;DR: 提出HAD框架解决RGB相机和事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，通过分层对齐策略实现多模态知识蒸馏，提升目标跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机和事件相机具有互补优势，但存在显著的时空不对称性，阻碍了有效的多模态融合。

Method: 提出分层不对称蒸馏(HAD)框架，采用分层对齐策略，在保持学生网络计算效率和参数紧凑性的同时最小化信息损失。

Result: 大量实验表明HAD持续优于最先进方法，消融研究验证了各设计组件的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: HAD成功解决了RGB和事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，为多模态目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

TL;DR: α-Cloak是首个针对物体检测器的无盒对抗攻击，通过RGBA视频的alpha通道将恶意视频与良性视频融合，使融合视频对人眼无害但能持续欺骗物体检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物体检测模型在自动驾驶车辆和监控平台等网络物理系统中的部署增加，确保其对抗性威胁的安全性至关重要。现有研究主要探索图像域的对抗攻击，而视频域的攻击，特别是在无盒设置下，尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 利用RGBA视频的alpha通道将恶意目标视频与良性视频融合，设计融合算法确保视觉隐蔽性和兼容性，无需访问模型架构、参数或输出。

Result: 在五种最先进的物体检测器、一个视觉语言模型和一个多模态大语言模型（Gemini-2.0-Flash）上评估，在所有场景中实现了100%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频感知系统中一个先前未被探索的漏洞，强调了在对抗性设置中考虑alpha通道的防御措施的紧迫性。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决环视自动驾驶场景重建中，由于视角重叠区域少导致几何一致性差和新视角重建质量低的问题，需要在保证泛化能力的同时提升新视角质量。

Method: 设计轻量级VGGT变体从预训练模型提取几何先验，构建高斯头融合多尺度几何token预测高斯参数，并集成几何和高斯头分支的多尺度特征通过特征一致性学习优化渲染质量。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法在各种设置下在客观指标和主观质量上都显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: VGD验证了其可扩展性和高保真环视重建能力，为自动驾驶场景重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Conclusion: VAEEDOF方法在多焦点图像融合领域取得了显著进展，有效解决了复杂的融合挑战。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

Abstract: Millions of clinical ECGs exist only as paper scans, making them unusable for
modern automated diagnostics. We introduce a fully automated, modular framework
that converts scanned or photographed ECGs into digital signals, suitable for
both clinical and research applications. The framework is validated on 37,191
ECG images with 1,596 collected at Akershus University Hospital, where the
algorithm obtains a mean signal-to-noise ratio of 19.65 dB on scanned papers
with common artifacts. It is further evaluated on the Emory Paper Digitization
ECG Dataset, comprising 35,595 images, including images with perspective
distortion, wrinkles, and stains. The model improves on the state-of-the-art in
all subcategories. The full software is released as open-source, promoting
reproducibility and further development. We hope the software will contribute
to unlocking retrospective ECG archives and democratize access to AI-driven

TL;DR: 提出DecAF方法，通过分解注意力融合机制将MLLM的注意力图直接转换为分割掩码，无需训练即可实现视频推理分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面表现强大，但其原始注意力图存在噪声且与物体区域对齐不佳，需要一种无需训练的方法来精炼这些注意力图以实现定位。

Method: 提出分解注意力融合(DecAF)，包含对比性物体-背景融合和互补视频帧融合两种机制，抑制无关激活并增强物体聚焦线索，结合注意力引导的SAM2提示获得细粒度掩码。

Result: DecAF在无需训练的方法中表现优异，在引用和推理VOS基准测试中达到与基于训练方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: DecAF提供了一种无需训练的有效方法，可将MLLM的注意力图直接用于视频分割任务，性能接近训练方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at
https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成单一确定性定位图，缺乏高精度和可靠性，无法满足法医分析和安全监控等高风险应用的需求。

Method: 使用条件伯努利扩散模型(CBDiff)，在扩散过程中引入伯努利噪声以更好地反映伪造掩码的二元稀疏特性，并设计时间步交叉注意力机制(TSCAttention)来利用语义特征引导。

Result: 在8个公开基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多个多样化定位图有效处理伪造区域的不确定性和变异性，具有强大的实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

Motivation: 传统的稀疏估计器在帧中无法充分适应复杂的信号规律性，对于边缘为分段C^α曲线的卡通图像，当Lipschitz指数α≤2是未知参数时，小波、曲波和Xlet帧都是次优的。需要开发能够达到所有α的极小极大渐近界的去噪方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了不同的调和分析方法来抑制信号噪声并指定函数的几何规律性，在调和分析与深度卷积网络去噪估计器之间建立了数学桥梁。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

Conclusion: GenComm提供了一种高效、可扩展的异构多智能体协作解决方案，通过生成通信机制实现了语义一致性和低成本集成。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

Motivation: 解决现有时刻检索方法面临的三个关键问题：数据稀缺导致模型陷入浅层关键词特征关联、相邻事件间边界模糊、细粒度语义区分能力不足

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：冷启动阶段使用课程学习在增强数据上建立基础边界/语义感知；蒸馏阶段引入双查询集（原始查询和主动查询），通过跨阶段蒸馏损失保持知识一致性

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AMR相比现有最先进方法实现了性能提升

Conclusion: AMR框架能够在不依赖额外数据的情况下有效解决时刻检索中的边界模糊和语义混淆问题，同时保持泛化能力

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves

TL;DR: 提出了MedReason-R1医学视觉语言模型，通过嵌入放大病灶区域和GRPO强化学习框架，在CT疾病诊断中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在医学领域表现不佳，主要由于缺乏大规模高质量医学影像数据集和忽略了从粗到细的诊断过程。

Method: 构建CT-RATE-VQA数据集(84K QA对)，提出MedReason-R1模型，嵌入放大病灶区域，并引入GRPO强化学习框架。

Result: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中达到最先进性能，同时保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式推理过程和强化学习，显著提升了医学视觉语言模型的诊断性能。

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,
checkpoints, and dataset are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReAct-GS通过重要性感知的致密化准则和参数扰动机制，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的梯度稀释和基元冻结问题，有效消除了过重构伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在复杂场景中会出现过重构伪影（局部模糊和针状扭曲），现有方法归因于大规模高斯分布分割不足，但本文发现两个根本限制：致密化过程中的梯度幅度稀释和基元冻结现象。

Method: 提出ReAct-GS方法，包含：(1) 重要性感知致密化准则，整合多视角的α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域中停滞的基元增长；(2) 重新激活机制，通过自适应参数扰动来激活冻结的基元。

Result: 在多样化真实数据集上的综合实验表明，ReAct-GS有效消除了过重构伪影，在新视角合成标准指标上达到最先进性能，同时保留了精细几何细节。该机制在其他3D-GS变体（如Pixel-GS）中也带来一致改进。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS通过重新激活机制成功解决了3D高斯泼溅中的关键限制，在消除伪影和保持几何细节方面表现出色，且具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CST框架，在无配对图像翻译中明确保留细长曲线结构，通过集成结构一致性训练来增强现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无配对图像翻译方法在医学成像中会扭曲细长曲线结构（如微血管），影响诊断可靠性和定量分析，这在眼科和血管成像中尤为重要。

Method: CST框架通过添加曲线结构提取模块提供拓扑监督，可无缝集成到现有方法中。在CycleGAN和UNSB两个代表性骨干网络上进行了集成验证。

Result: 在三种成像模态（OCT血管造影、彩色眼底和X射线冠状动脉造影）上的综合评估表明，CST提高了翻译保真度并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过增强学习映射中的几何完整性，CST为医学成像中的曲线结构感知跨域翻译建立了原则性途径。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

Motivation: 现有深度学习活体检测系统多为黑盒模型，决策过程不透明，需要解释性技术来理解模型行为

Method: 提出Ensemble-CAM技术，为深度学习人脸活体检测系统提供视觉解释，识别图像中影响真假判断的关键区域

Result: 该方法能提供详细的视觉解释，帮助理解深度学习模型在活体检测中的决策依据

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM提高了深度学习活体检测系统的透明度和可信度，有助于更好地理解模型行为

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT是一个两阶段框架，通过时空注意力机制和稳定性约束从高维视频中提取可解释的动态系统变量，抑制视觉干扰因素，实现鲁棒的潜在表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高维视频中提取系统真实动态变量具有挑战性，因为存在背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等干扰视觉因素。

Method: 第一阶段使用时序变换器自编码器，通过全局注意力聚焦动态相关区域；第二阶段通过线性相关分析选择物理意义维度，并用Lyapunov稳定性正则化器优化转移动态。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动态系统上的实验表明，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动保持不变性，在CNN和变换器基线中具有最低的分析均方误差。

Conclusion: 结合时空注意力与稳定性约束可以产生既准确又物理可解释的预测模型。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

TL;DR: 提出了ADQ自适应分布感知量化框架，通过自适应权重量化方案解决激活值分布不均和权重量化码本不匹配问题，在ImageNet上仅用2.81位平均位宽实现71.512%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化感知训练方法面临两个主要挑战：激活值的非均匀分布问题，以及权重量化中使用的静态、不匹配码本问题。

Method: ADQ框架包含三个关键创新：基于分位数的码本初始化方法、基于指数移动平均的在线码本自适应机制、以及基于敏感性的混合精度分配策略。对于激活值，集成了硬件友好的非均匀到均匀映射方案。

Result: 在ImageNet上，ADQ使ResNet-18仅用2.81位平均位宽达到71.512% Top-1准确率，在可比条件下优于最先进方法。在CIFAR-10上的消融研究验证了各创新组件的贡献。

Conclusion: ADQ通过自适应分布感知量化有效解决了现有量化方法的局限性，在保持低精度的情况下实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X是一个多功能多模态人体运动生成框架，采用自回归扩散变换器，支持文本到运动、音乐到舞蹈、语音到手势等多种任务，并构建了最大的多模态运动数据集OmniMoCap-X。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态人体运动生成中的一致性和控制性问题，特别是处理不同模态输入时的冲突，需要开发一个统一框架来支持多种任务并生成高质量、连贯的运动序列。

Method: 提出使用参考运动作为条件信号，采用渐进式弱到强混合条件训练策略处理多模态冲突，构建了包含28个MoCap源的大型数据集OmniMoCap-X，并使用GPT-4o自动生成结构化标注。

Result: 实验评估表明，OmniMotion-X在多个多模态任务上显著超越现有方法，实现了最先进的性能，能够生成逼真、连贯且可控的长时运动序列。

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X通过统一的多模态框架和创新的训练策略，成功解决了多模态运动生成中的关键挑战，为交互式高质量运动生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

TL;DR: 提出CPL-NC框架，通过类别感知原型缓存和负对比学习机制，解决视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的测试时适应问题，提升长尾分布和语义相似类别的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在分布偏移时性能下降，现有测试时适应方法忽略长尾分布中的原型退化和语义相似类别混淆问题。

Method: CPL-NC框架包含类别感知原型缓存模块（动态调整类别容量和激活机制）和负对比学习机制（约束困难负样本），采用非对称优化仅更新文本原型。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，CPL-NC在ResNet-50和ViT-B/16骨干网络上均优于现有测试时适应方法。

Conclusion: CPL-NC通过原型管理和负对比学习有效提升了视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在文本引导图像编辑方面取得显著进展，但研究社区缺乏大规模、高质量、开放可用的真实图像数据集，限制了进一步的发展。

Method: 利用Nano-Banana从OpenImages的真实照片生成多样化的编辑对，采用细粒度图像编辑分类法确保编辑类型全面覆盖，通过MLLM质量评分和精心筛选保证内容保留和指令忠实度。

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K为训练和评估下一代文本引导图像编辑模型提供了大规模、高质量、任务丰富的资源基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

Motivation: 单目深度估计研究进展迅速，但如何评估仍是一个开放问题，现有文献缺乏标准化，评估指标选择众多且其权衡和行为未被充分理解。

Method: 对现有指标进行定量分析，考察它们对地面真实值各种扰动的敏感性，并与人类判断进行比较；引入基于相对表面法线的新指标、新的深度可视化工具和创建综合指标的原理方法。

Result: 分析显示现有指标对曲率扰动（如使平坦表面波浪化）严重不敏感；新提出的相对表面法线指标能更好地与人类判断对齐。

Conclusion: 需要改进单目深度估计的评估指标，新提出的基于相对表面法线的指标和综合指标创建方法能够提供更好的人类对齐评估。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and
diagnosing the capabilities and limitations of point tracking methods. Our
videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in
current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking
methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.
Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical
failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架来分析验证式测试时缩放中的三个关键因素：生成器覆盖率、验证器收敛区域和采样算法的次优性，揭示了次优性-覆盖率曲线的三个不同区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然带验证的测试时缩放显示出提升大语言模型性能的潜力，但验证器的作用及其不完善性仍未得到充分探索。现有研究只捕捉了这些因素的部分方面，缺乏一个量化它们相互作用的统一框架。

Method: 将可验证的测试时缩放构建为一个传输问题，通过这个框架来刻画覆盖率、验证器收敛区域和次优性之间的相互作用。提出并分析了两种采样算法类别——顺序采样和批量采样。

Result: 发现次优性-覆盖率曲线存在三个区域：传输区域（次优性随覆盖率增加而增加）、策略改进区域（次优性可能随覆盖率减少，取决于验证器的收敛区域）和饱和区域（次优性趋于平稳，不受覆盖率影响）。实证结果与理论发现一致。

Conclusion: 通过传输问题框架揭示了验证式测试时缩放中关键因素之间的几何相互作用，为理解和优化大语言模型的测试时性能提供了理论基础。

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

### [80] [Rectifying Shortcut Behaviors in Preference-based Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19050)
*Wenqian Ye,Guangtao Zheng,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PRISM方法解决基于偏好的奖励模型中的捷径行为问题，通过学习群不变核来缓解奖励黑客化和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类反馈的强化学习中，偏好奖励模型容易出现奖励黑客化，通过利用训练数据中的虚假特征（如回答冗长、讨好语气等）获得高奖励分数，而非真正反映预期目标。

Method: 受核视角不变性理论启发，提出PRISM方法，通过闭式学习目标学习具有特征映射的群不变核。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法持续提高了奖励模型在不同分布外任务上的准确性，并减少了下游策略模型对捷径的依赖。

Conclusion: PRISM为基于偏好的对齐建立了一个稳健的框架，有效缓解了奖励模型中的捷径行为问题。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

### [81] [The MUSE Benchmark: Probing Music Perception and Auditory Relational Reasoning in Audio LLMS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19055)
*Brandon James Carone,Iran R. Roman,Pablo Ripollés*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUSE基准测试评估多模态大语言模型的音乐理解能力，发现现有模型在关系推理方面存在根本性弱点，与人类专家存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对多模态大语言模型音频理解的评估可能掩盖了其在关系推理方面的根本弱点，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 开发了MUSE基准测试，包含10个任务来探测基础音乐感知技能，评估了4个SOTA模型并与200名人类基线进行比较。

Result: SOTA模型能力差异很大，与人类专家存在持续差距。Gemini Pro在基础感知上表现良好，但Qwen和Audio Flamingo 3表现接近随机水平，思维链提示效果不一致且通常有害。

Conclusion: MUSE基准为评估不变音乐表示和开发更鲁棒的AI系统提供了关键工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural
Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to
probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过行为和元认知分析方法，比较了两种代表性LLM在三种提示条件下评估临床试验报告CONSORT标准的能力，揭示了模型在推理风格、不确定性表达和替代解释方面的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在医疗领域迅速扩展，但这些系统根据CONSORT标准评估临床试验报告的能力尚不清楚，特别是在认知和推理策略方面。

Method: 应用行为和元认知分析方法，使用专家验证数据，在三种提示条件下系统比较两种代表性LLM。

Result: 模型在处理不同CONSORT项目和提示类型时表现出明显差异，包括推理风格转变、明确不确定性表达和替代解释模式。

Conclusion: 结果突显了这些系统在临床合规自动化方面的当前局限性，并强调了理解其认知适应和策略行为对于开发更可解释和可靠的医疗AI的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了推理模型中的模式选择问题，将其识别为早期退出问题的更具挑战性变体。研究发现现有方法在信息有限的情况下难以有效解决模式选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型虽然表现出色，但经常导致过度思考，产生不必要的计算开销。模式选择和早期退出都旨在减少计算负担，但模式选择需要在推理过程开始时做出决策，更具挑战性。

Method: 通过实证研究比较九种基线方法，包括基于提示的方法和利用内部信息的方法。模式选择需要在推理开始时基于预定义的虚假思考做出决策，称为零步思考。

Result: 基于提示的方法由于分类能力有限而经常失败，而利用内部信息的方法在大多数情况下表现更好但仍存在稳定性问题。现有方法在信息有限的情况下不足以有效解决模式选择问题。

Conclusion: 模式选择是早期退出问题的更具挑战性变体，现有方法在信息有限的情况下效果有限，凸显了该任务的持续挑战性。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/Zero_Step_Thinking.

TL;DR: WebGraphEval是一个将多智能体轨迹抽象为统一加权动作图的框架，用于评估网页智能体，能够捕捉结构性多样性并识别关键决策点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页智能体评估主要依赖二元成功指标或单一参考轨迹，忽略了基准数据集中的结构性多样性。

Method: 将多个智能体的轨迹抽象为统一的加权动作图，规范编码动作，合并重复行为，并应用结构分析包括奖励传播和成功加权边统计。

Result: 在来自六个网页智能体的数千条轨迹上的评估显示，图抽象能够捕捉跨模型规律性，突出冗余和低效，并识别被基于结果的指标忽略的关键决策点。

Conclusion: 通过将网页交互框架化为图结构数据，WebGraphEval为网页智能体的多路径、跨智能体和效率感知评估建立了通用方法。

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过法律领域的实验评估ChatGPT性能，发现即使具备必要知识和能力，ChatGPT仍无法整合这些能力进行推理以产生全面结果，揭示了其在复杂问题分解和综合解决方面的重大局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估ChatGPT在法律领域的实际表现，特别是与正则表达式基线对比，而不仅仅关注与人类表现的比较，以揭示AI在复杂推理任务中的真实局限性。

Method: 在法律领域进行实验，将ChatGPT的表现与基于正则表达式(Regex)的基线方法进行比较，重点关注法律决策中提取法律原则关键段落的任务。

Result: 研究发现ChatGPT即使拥有必要知识和能力，也无法有效整合这些能力进行推理以产生全面结果，在法律原则提取任务中表现不如预期。

Conclusion: 真正的智能包括分解复杂问题并根据多种所需能力解决问题的能力，提供统一全面的解决方案。在法律领域，人工智能缺乏全面理解和推理能力，真正的智能仍然是人类独有的特质。

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统先例约束推理假设先例集必须一致，而广义推理模型放松了这一假设。虽然已有基于传统一致推理模型的论证解释方法，但尚无针对容纳不一致先例的广义推理框架的相应论证解释方法。

Method: 扩展推导状态论证框架(DSA-framework)，以解释基于广义推理模型的推理过程。

Result: 开发了能够解释广义推理模型中推理的论证框架扩展。

Conclusion: 成功扩展了DSA框架，为容纳不一致先例的广义推理模型提供了论证性解释能力。

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型智能体能否复现人类在线社交的复杂动态，以及哪些记忆和学习机制促成了这种动态的出现。

Method: 开发多智能体LLM模拟框架，智能体通过情境学习和教练信号进行反复互动、相互评估和行为适应，设计了捕捉在线参与核心驱动因素的行为奖励函数。

Result: 实验表明，经过教练的LLM智能体形成了稳定的互动模式和涌现的社交联系，产生的网络结构反映了真实在线社区的特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究LLM群体中的集体动态建立了原则性测试平台，揭示了人工智能智能体如何近似或偏离类人社交行为。

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了CKA-RL方法，通过持续知识适应策略和自适应知识合并机制，解决强化学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升跨任务知识利用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界环境通常是非平稳的，需要智能体持续适应新任务和变化条件。现有的持续强化学习方法存在灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率低的问题。

Method: 提出持续知识适应策略，维护任务特定知识向量池，动态使用历史知识适应新任务；引入自适应知识合并机制，合并相似知识向量以解决可扩展性挑战。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的实验表明，CKA-RL优于现有最优方法，整体性能提升4.20%，前向迁移提升8.02%。

Conclusion: CKA-RL通过有效的知识积累和适应机制，成功缓解了灾难性遗忘，实现了跨任务的高效知识迁移。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

TL;DR: MSC-Bench是一个用于评估LLM代理在分层MCP生态系统中多跳端到端工具编排能力的大规模基准测试，通过构建"等函数集"来建立真实基准，减少对LLM作为评估器的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常在孤立环境中评估工具，忽略了功能重叠和跨服务器编排等挑战，导致评估过于乐观。

Method: 采用五级课程设计，从单工具编排到复杂跨服务器规划系统测试代理能力，并通过"等函数集"构建真实基准，使用F1分数等客观指标。

Result: 实验表明，刚性分层结构会阻碍性能，即使最先进的代理在鲁棒性方面也存在系统性弱点。

Conclusion: MSC-Bench提供了一个诊断框架来暴露这些局限性，并指导开发更强大、更高效的工具使用代理。

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at

TL;DR: NeSyPr是一个神经符号程序化框架，通过将符号规划转化为可组合的程序表示，使语言模型能够在动态环境中进行高效推理，无需依赖外部符号规划器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态环境中使用语言模型进行具身任务时，由于延迟、连接性和资源限制而无法在线访问大规模推理引擎或符号规划器的问题。

Method: 首先使用符号工具生成任务特定规划，然后将这些规划转化为编码隐式产生规则的可组合程序表示，最后将这些程序无缝集成到语言模型的推理过程中。

Result: 在PDDLGym、VirtualHome和ALFWorld等具身基准测试中，NeSyPr展现出比大规模推理模型和符号规划器更高效的推理能力，同时使用更紧凑的语言模型。

Conclusion: 神经符号程序化能够将多步符号结构化路径查找和推理抽象为单步语言模型推理，适用于延迟敏感和资源受限的物理系统部署。

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言指令的灵活性导致语言条件任务中存在大量模糊性，严重降低了算法性能。

Method: DAIL包含两个关键组件：分布策略（通过值分布估计机制增强任务可区分性）和语义对齐模块（捕捉轨迹与语言指令之间的对应关系）。

Result: 在结构化和视觉观察基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DAIL能有效解决指令模糊性问题，性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DAIL通过分布对齐学习有效解决了语言指令的模糊性挑战，为智能代理理解自然语言指令提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSCodeComp是首个评估深度搜索代理在分层规则应用能力的电子商务基准测试，要求代理根据产品描述预测10位协调制度代码，结果显示最佳代理准确率仅46.8%，远低于人类专家的95.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试忽视了代理应用复杂规则（如法律条款、医疗手册和关税规则）的关键能力，这些规则具有模糊边界和隐式逻辑关系，对代理提出了挑战。

Method: 从大型电子商务平台收集真实数据构建HSCodeComp基准，包含632个产品条目，涵盖多样化产品类别，HSCode由多位人类专家标注。

Result: 在多个最先进的LLM、开源和闭源代理上的实验结果显示巨大性能差距：最佳代理仅达到46.8%的10位准确率，远低于人类专家的95.0%，且测试时扩展无法进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 分层规则应用对当前代理具有挑战性，需要开发更先进的代理来应对现实世界中的复杂规则推理任务。

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

Motivation: 现有的城市感知系统在多样化城市场景中泛化能力有限，决策过程缺乏可解释性，需要开发既能适应动态条件又能提供透明解释的解决方案。

Method: 采用混合训练免费框架，结合经典规划器生成基线解决方案，然后通过多智能体进化系统迭代优化，使感知任务分配适应动态城市条件和异构工作者偏好。

Result: 在两个大规模移动数据集和七种动态干扰上的实验表明，AgentSense在适应性和可解释性方面优于传统方法，相比单智能体LLM基线在性能和鲁棒性上表现更优。

Conclusion: AgentSense代表了向部署自适应和可解释城市感知系统的重要进展，为基于网络的城市管理提供了更可靠和透明的解决方案。

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

Conclusion: 该系统可被排名和推荐系统利用，通过可解释性模块促进对预测结果的信任，支持明智决策。

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

*Yang Yang,Hua XU,Zhangyi Hu,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLIE是一个将大语言模型与概率建模相结合的统一框架，用于学习加权规则集，通过四个阶段实现规则生成、权重学习、迭代优化和评估，发现直接使用学习到的权重规则优于将规则注入LLM的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的规则学习方法忽视规则间的相互作用，且未充分探索将LLM与概率规则学习结合进行鲁棒推理的机会。

Method: RLIE框架包含四个阶段：1) LLM生成和筛选候选规则；2) 逻辑回归学习概率权重进行全局选择和校准；3) 基于预测误差迭代优化规则集；4) 评估加权规则集作为直接分类器的性能。

Result: 直接使用学习到的权重规则表现出优越性能，而将规则、权重和逻辑模型输出提示给LLM反而会降低准确性，表明LLM擅长语义生成和解释，但在精确概率集成方面可靠性较低。

Conclusion: RLIE阐明了LLM在归纳推理中的潜力和局限性，通过将其与经典概率规则组合方法结合，实现了更可靠的神经符号推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

*Gunshi Gupta,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira,Yarin Gal,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo是一个基于transformer的架构和训练方法，用于解决强化学习中记忆密集型、长时程任务的记忆压缩和检索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么使用固定大小的循环记忆模型，要么依赖完整上下文的transformer，无法有效处理视觉输入对transformer上下文限制的挑战。人类能够将终身经验压缩为记忆，而现有方法缺乏这种压缩能力。

Method: Memo通过在模型训练时在输入中插入周期性总结标记来实现记忆的创建和检索，从而压缩和抽象无关信息。

Result: Memo在网格世界元强化学习基准和照片级真实室内多目标导航任务中表现优于朴素的长上下文transformer基线，同时计算和存储效率更高。

Conclusion: Memo在推理时对更长上下文具有更好的泛化能力，在流式设置中保持鲁棒性，能够有效处理历史上下文被截断的情况。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了PROBE基准来评估LLM智能体的主动性能力，将主动性分解为三个核心能力：搜索未指定问题、识别具体瓶颈和执行适当解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估主动性的基准局限于局部上下文，无法测试跨来源和长时间跨度的推理能力。

Method: PROBE将主动性分解为三个核心能力管道：搜索未指定问题、识别具体瓶颈和执行适当解决方案，并应用于评估领先的LLM和流行智能体框架。

Result: 即使是先进模型也难以解决该基准，GPT-5和Claude Opus-4.1的最佳端到端性能仅为40%。

Conclusion: 结果突显了智能体系统中自主行动的当前局限性，并揭示了有前景的未来研究方向。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

TL;DR: WorldTest是一个评估模型学习智能体的新协议，将无奖励交互与不同但相关环境中的测试阶段分离，支持多种未知任务。通过AutumnBench基准测试发现人类表现优于前沿模型，计算扩展仅在部分环境中提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型学习和评估方法偏离了实际目标：训练和评估都锚定在下一帧预测，成功标准是在同一环境中最大化奖励。需要一种能评估智能体对环境动态学习程度的开放框架。

Method: 提出WorldTest协议，包含无奖励探索、派生测试和行为评分三个环节。实例化为AutumnBench基准，包含43个交互式网格世界环境和129个任务，涵盖掩码帧预测、规划和因果动态变化预测三类任务。

Result: 比较了517名人类参与者和三个前沿模型，发现人类表现优于模型，计算扩展仅在部分环境中提升性能，在其他环境中无效。

Conclusion: WorldTest提供了一个评估智能体对环境动态学习程度的新模板，AutumnBench揭示了世界模型学习仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.
