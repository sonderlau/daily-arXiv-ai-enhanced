Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into\nthe intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By\nsystematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of\nmathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core\nproperty of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct\ntrajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable\nsignal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained\nself-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable\neffective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we\nintroduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation\nresults confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be\ninduced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection\nstructure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by\nintroducing external signals.

By exploiting results from the\ndatabase setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data\ncomplexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are\nfirst-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes \"shP\"-hard when the\nontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\\exists R.\nA \\sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next\nexplore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that\nintractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language\nsupports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive\nqueries, even in the absence of an ontology.

Synthetic\ndata methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering\nreal-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability\nto be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods\nthat rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning\nto ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed\nextends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on\nreference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a\ndiffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,\nmaintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically\nblending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate\nthat foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be\nreadily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next\ngeneration of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable\nand multimodal counterfactual scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5MObI\u548cAnydoorMed\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "MObI\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u652f\u63013D\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u6761\u4ef6\uff1bAnydoorMed\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Recent research has\ndemonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for\npredefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in\nharnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily\non the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and\nrefinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,\nEnriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art\nresults in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater\ninterpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and\nnew domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot\nclassification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA\nwhile being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our\nvocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid\nlabel prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable\nand generalizable systems for real-world applications.

In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve\ninformation from its equipped memory module to help the person recall\nincomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the\nacquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in\npractice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be\nproactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose\na novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent\nto transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed\nstrategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key\nchallenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse\nforgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to\nobtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only\nabstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,\nwe propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map\nto classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen\nrecall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a\nhierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to\noptimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We\nconstruct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source\nlarge language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in\nproviding memory-inspired responses.

To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided\ndiffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce\nadversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our\ndesign is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed\nhigh-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target\nsemantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added\nnoise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial\nsignal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.\nImportantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a\nlinear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying\ndefenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each\ncomponent, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to\nbe suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band.

While deep learning-based detection\nmethods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the\ninadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for\ndiverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for\nsmall-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and\ncomputational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for\nefficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road\nOrthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial\nPyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature\nextraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to\nreduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional\nspatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.\nConcurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from\n3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the\nRDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of\n67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the\nsmall-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only\n2.0 MB.

While traditional\nnumerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise\naccuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,\nwhich is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we\npropose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation\nmetric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent\ntwo-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image\ntransformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly\nintegrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal\nLoss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series\nmodality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.\nSATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures\nstructural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a\nfrequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast\nFourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that\nmeasures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal\nfeatures with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal\nfeature extractor and time-series image autoencoder.

While AI-powered tools hold promise for\naccelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products\nremains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,\nproprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate\nwhether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,\nminimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box\nannotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D\nvolume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,\nbottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large\ncohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most\nconsistent and accurate segmentations.

Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we\nintroduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D\nGaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by\nthree core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view\nimages to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional\nmulti-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce\ncomputational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every\nlayer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction.

However, current\nvision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify\nclinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their\ninherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically\ndepend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for\nsmall-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive\nGrouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics\nfrom paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping\nmechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we\ncompute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each\ntoken selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch\nselects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive\ngrouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped\nThreshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping\nthresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages\nbased on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,\nwe introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each\nimage-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a\nBidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance\nfine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.\nExtensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method\nachieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks\nunder both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7ec4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08AGA\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u62a5\u544a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u4e34\u5e8a\u62a5\u544a\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u5b9e\u4f53\u6216\u788e\u7247\u5316\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "AGA\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u5206\u7ec4\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7ec4\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u7ec4\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7ec4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAGA\u5728\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "AGA\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,\nwe identify that different architectures have statistically different\nconcentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA\nmodels differ markedly from the others.

For\ntraffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal\nContrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a\nVision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL\nlearns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating\nclass confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method\nachieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for\nall-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,\nsignificantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior\naccuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u8bc6\u522b\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u9762\u4e34\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNanoVerse YOLO\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u542bRepVL-PAN\u548cSPD-Conv\u6a21\u5757\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caTSR-MCL\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728TT100K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cmAP\u8fbe78.4%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a91.8%\u548c88.9%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f00\u653e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The analy- sis begins with foundational\narchitectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced\nresidual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable\neffective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.\nSubsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new\nparadigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image\npatches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale\nimage recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we\ninvestigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are\nanalyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a\ngenerator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,\nLatent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative\nmethods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually\ncompressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater\ncomputational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image\ngeneration.

The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of\nemotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for\nboth tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding\nchain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale\nemotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.\nSimultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to\nguide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the\ndiversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce\nthe emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the\nfusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional\ngeneration guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint\ntraining allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the\nunderstanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to\nselect high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained\nmodel, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part.

This one-shot alignment struggles with\nnoisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal\nfeature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source\nscenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple\nsource domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this\nissue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting\nCLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a\nhigh-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a\nwell-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training\nprogresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the\nmodel to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label\nnoise.

However,\na comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral\nand spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been\nthoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for\nunderstanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint\nspatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we\npropose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network\n(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in\nboth spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)\nspectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter\nencoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder\nmodule. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to\ncapture both short-range and long-range redundancies.

To conduct an in-depth performance\nanalysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed\ndataset.

The initial\nstage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and\nsynthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local\nregions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the\nsynthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where\ndiffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a\n3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data\nsimulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with\nthe 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances\nperformance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation\ndemonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and\nreal-captured patterns.

In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based\nrepresentations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We\npropose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for\nvisual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an\nimplicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and\ndifferentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature\nrepresentations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware\nfeature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a\ncontrastive framework.

Recent studies\ndemonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation\nto compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through\ndynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space\nmodel called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame\nsequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated\nby this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on\nspatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial\nfeatures for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive\nfield visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features\nafter sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive\nfrequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain\nsequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose\na space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based\nlong-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and\nfrequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains.

Methods that use this approach combine\nthe power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven\nlearning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods\nin this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and\nstill rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for\nfunctional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the\naccuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios\nwhere assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the\nfirst time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can\nbe replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative\nmodel of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative\nmodeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit\nthe resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth\nfunctional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the\nlearned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used\nstrategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of\nfunctional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation\nstrategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic\napproaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching.

Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design\na feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision\nFoundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art\non our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from\nsingle-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u2014\u2014Sequential 3D Gaussian Affordance Reasoning\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86SeqAffordSplat\u57fa\u51c6\u548cSeqSplatNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b3D\u529f\u80fd\u533a\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u5355\u6b65\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSeqSplatNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u751f\u62103D\u529f\u80fd\u533a\u57df\u63a9\u7801\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SeqAffordSplat\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u529f\u80fd\u533a\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u4ece\u5355\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}
