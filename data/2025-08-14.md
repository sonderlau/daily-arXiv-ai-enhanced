Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了北方造林对地球能量失衡（EEI）的双重影响，提出需结合生物地球化学和生物物理过程的气候智能选址框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球能量失衡加速，部分原因是云量减少导致的行星反照率下降。北方造林可能通过竞争性生物物理反馈加剧或缓解这一趋势。

Method: 研究提出了一种分层决策支持框架，整合了生物地球化学和生物物理过程，并明确纳入云-气溶胶反馈。

Result: 造林可能通过减少地表反照率（+0.5至+2.5 W/m²增温）或增加低层云量和反射率（-1.8至-6.7 W/m²降温）影响EEI。

Conclusion: 政策中亟需纳入云-气溶胶反馈，以确保北方造林有助于稳定EEI，避免无意增温。

Abstract: Earth's Energy Imbalance (EEI) is accelerating, partly due to declining
planetary albedo from reduced cloud cover. Boreal afforestation can either
mitigate or exacerbate this trend through competing biophysical feedbacks.
While snow masking reduces surface albedo (+0.5 to +2.5 $W/m^2$ warming),
forests can enhance low-level cloud cover (0.1-0.5%) and increase cloud
reflectivity via biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), producing
potential cooling (-1.8 to -6.7 $W/m^2$). This BVOC-aerosol-cloud pathway
remains poorly constrained but may dominate under warmer conditions,
challenging carbon-centric mitigation paradigms. Large-scale initiatives (e.g.,
Canada's 2 Billion Tree Commitment) risk unintended warming if not
climate-smartly sited. We present a tiered decision-support framework that
integrates biogeochemical and biophysical processes, explicitly incorporating
cloud-aerosol feedbacks. Urgent inclusion of these feedbacks in policy is
essential to ensure boreal afforestation contributes to EEI stabilization.

### [2] [Bridging Clarity and Accuracy: A Simple Spectral Longwave Radiation Scheme for Idealized Climate Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09353)
*Andrew I. L. Williams*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SSM的简单光谱模型，用于晴空长波辐射传输，平衡了物理准确性与概念清晰性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可用的辐射传输方案要么过于复杂（如相关k方案），要么过于简化（如灰辐射方案），无法同时满足准确性和清晰性的需求。

Method: SSM通过解析拟合H₂O和CO₂吸收的光谱结构，并使用简单函数形式扩展到不同大气条件，结合两流求解器，实现了六方程十参数的简化系统。

Result: 在理想化的水行星GCM中，SSM准确模拟了相关k方案的结果，并显著改善了灰辐射方案的偏差，包括辐射冷却剖面、对流层结构、急流动力学和哈德莱环流特征。

Conclusion: SSM证明了即使是简单的光谱表示也能捕捉长波辐射传输的基本物理，适用于理想化气候建模和教学。

Abstract: Parameterizing radiative transfer in means navigating trade-offs between
physical accuracy and conceptual clarity. However, currently available schemes
sit at the extremes of this spectrum: correlated-k schemes are fast and
accurate but rely on lookup tables which obscure the underlying physics and
make such schemes difficult to modify, while gray radiation schemes are
conceptually straightforward but introduce significant biases in atmospheric
circulation. Here we introduce a Simple Spectral Model (SSM) for clear-sky
longwave radiative transfer which bridges this `clarity-accuracy' gap. The SSM
accomplishes this by representing the spectral structure of H$_{2}$O and
CO$_{2}$ absorption using analytic fits at reference conditions, then uses
simple functional forms to extend these fits to different atmospheric
conditions. This, coupled to a simple, two-stream solver, yields a system of
six equations and ten physically-meaningful parameters which can solve for
clear-sky longwave fluxes given atmospheric profiles of temperature and
humidity. When implemented in an idealized aquaplanet GCM, the SSM produces
zonal-mean climate states which accurately mimic the results using a benchmark
correlated-k code. The SSM also alleviates the significant zonal-mean climate
biases associated with using gray radiation, including an improved
representation of radiative cooling profiles, tropopause structure, jet
dynamics, and Hadley Cell characteristics both in control climates and in
response to uniform warming. This work demonstrates that even a simple spectral
representation of atmospheric absorption suffices to capture the essential
physics of longwave radiative transfer, and the SSM promises to be a valuable
tool both for idealized climate modeling, and for teaching radiative transfer
in the classroom.

### [3] [Weather Jiu-Jitsu: Climate Adaptation for the 21st Century](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09376)
*Qin Huang,Moyan Liu,Upmanu Lall*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 提出“天气柔术”策略，利用天气系统的混沌动力学，通过精准的小能量干预减轻极端气候事件的破坏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端气候事件频发且加剧，现有基础设施难以应对，需探索新的适应性策略。

Method: 结合自适应混沌控制理论、改进的观测和预测技术，以及低能量天气系统干预。

Result: 可能开发出新型全球基础设施，减轻21世纪极端气候的影响。

Conclusion: “天气柔术”是一种有潜力的策略，需进一步研究以应对极端气候挑战。

Abstract: Extreme climate events, e.g., droughts, floods, heat waves, and freezes, are
becoming more frequent and intense with severe global socio-economic impacts.
Growing populations and economic activity leads to increased exposure to these
events. Scaling existing physical, financial, and social infrastructure to
provide resilience against these extreme events is daunting, especially as one
ponders projected climate changes. Climate extremes pose a challenge even if
decarbonization and geoengineering are able to regulate Earth's radiation
balance.
  We argue that there is an urgent need to explore a novel adaptive strategy
that we call "Weather Jiu-Jitsu," which leverages the intrinsic chaotic
dynamics of weather systems to subtly redirect or dissipate their destructive
trajectories through precisely timed, small-energy interventions. By leveraging
insights from adaptive chaos control, combined with improved observations,
prediction and low-energy weather system interventions, humanity could develop
a novel nature assisted global infrastructure to limit the impact of climate
extremes in the 21st century.

### [4] [Similarities in the Initiation of Upward Positive and Downward Negative Lightning Flashes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09440)
*Toma Oregel-Chaumont,Mohammad Azadifar,Antonio Šunjerga,Marcos Rubinstein,Farhad Rachidi*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 研究比较了向上正闪电中的负阶梯先导脉冲与向下负闪电中的预击穿脉冲的相似性，发现两者物理机制可能相同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索向上和向下闪电的起始过程是否存在共同的物理机制。

Method: 通过分析瑞士Säntis塔的同步通道基电流和电场数据，结合高速摄像观察。

Result: 发现向上正闪电的A类脉冲与向下负闪电的预击穿脉冲有显著相关性，B类脉冲可能与向下传播的反冲先导有关。

Conclusion: 向上闪电的详细观测为闪电起始和传播的复杂过程提供了新见解。

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between upward negative stepped leader
pulses in upward positive lightning and preliminary breakdown pulses (PBPs) in
downward negative lightning discharges. Through analysis of simultaneous
channel-base current and electric field data from the S\"{a}ntis tower in
Switzerland, we found notable similarities between Category A and B upward
positive lightning pulses and the "Classical" and "Narrow" PBPs observed in
downward negative flashes. Statistical comparisons reveal correlations between
electric field and current parameters for Category A pulses, supporting the
field-current relationship for preliminary breakdown proposed in previous
studies. These results suggest common physical mechanisms underlying both
upward and downward lightning initiation processes, providing valuable insights
into lightning initiation that could not be obtained from conventional field
measurements alone. Furthermore, high-speed camera footage revealed that
Category B pulses can be produced by a downward-propagating recoil leader. As a
whole, these findings demonstrate that detailed observations of upward
lightning can offer valuable insight into the complex processes underlying
lightning initiation and propagation.

### [5] [Reinforcement learning in densely recurrent biological networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09618)
*Miles Walter Churchland,Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: ENOMAD是一种结合全局进化探索和局部直接搜索的混合优化框架，用于训练高维连续动作空间的循环网络，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决梯度方法在训练循环网络时的梯度爆炸或消失问题，以及纯进化搜索在高维权重空间中收敛慢的问题。

Method: 引入ENOMAD框架，结合进化探索和直接搜索，利用生物权重先验优化自然循环网络。

Result: 在食物觅食任务中，ENOMAD显著优于未经训练的连接组和现有训练策略。

Conclusion: 进化搜索与非线性优化结合为自然循环网络的任务专业化提供了高效且生物学合理的策略。

Abstract: Training highly recurrent networks in continuous action spaces is a technical
challenge: gradient-based methods suffer from exploding or vanishing gradients,
while purely evolutionary searches converge slowly in high-dimensional weight
spaces. We introduce a hybrid, derivative-free optimization framework that
implements reinforcement learning by coupling global evolutionary exploration
with local direct search exploitation. The method, termed ENOMAD (Evolutionary
Nonlinear Optimization with Mesh Adaptive Direct search), is benchmarked on a
suite of food-foraging tasks instantiated in the fully mapped neural connectome
of the nematode \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}. Crucially, ENOMAD leverages
biologically derived weight priors, letting it refine--rather than rebuild--the
organism's native circuitry. Two algorithmic variants of the method are
introduced, which lead to either small distributed adjustments of many weights,
or larger changes on a limited number of weights. Both variants significantly
exceed the performance of the untrained connectome (in what can be interpreted
as an example of transfer learning) and of existing training strategies. These
findings demonstrate that integrating evolutionary search with nonlinear
optimization provides an efficient, biologically grounded strategy for
specializing natural recurrent networks towards a specified set of tasks.

### [6] [A Context-aware Attention and Graph Neural Network-based Multimodal Framework for Misogyny Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09175)
*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Sufyaan Zahoor,Areeb Manzoor,Musharaf Maqbool,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态框架，用于检测针对女性的厌恶和性别歧视内容，通过三个模块（MANM、GFRM、CFLM）提升检测性能，并在两个数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上针对女性的攻击性内容较多，现有方法对此类内容的检测效果不佳，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 采用多模态框架，包括注意力模块（MANM）、图特征重构模块（GFRM）和内容特征学习模块（CFLM），并结合特定词汇表和测试时增强技术。

Result: 在MAMI和MMHS150K数据集上，平均宏F1分数分别提高了10.17%和8.88%。

Conclusion: 所提出的多模态框架能有效检测针对女性的攻击性内容，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed
towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection
face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions
tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a
novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist
content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module
(MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the
Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive
gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on
relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant
features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual
modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features
such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set
of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the
text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the
predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has
been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and
13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average
improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI
and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.

### [7] [Event-driven Robust Fitting on Neuromorphic Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09466)
*Tam Ngoc-Bang Nguyen,Anh-Dzung Doan,Zhipeng Cai,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经形态计算范式（Intel Loihi 2硬件）的能量高效鲁棒拟合方法，通过设计新型脉冲神经网络，实现了仅需标准CPU 15%的能耗即可达到相同精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒拟合方法在计算机视觉中广泛应用，但能量效率问题未受重视。随着AI能耗问题日益突出，探索能量高效方法变得至关重要。

Method: 设计了新型脉冲神经网络，结合事件驱动的模型估计方法，并针对Loihi 2硬件的限制提出了算法优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在Intel Loihi 2上仅消耗标准CPU 15%的能耗，且达到相同精度。

Conclusion: 神经形态计算为鲁棒拟合提供了能量高效的解决方案，未来可进一步优化硬件和算法以提升性能。

Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer
vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from
improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to
generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with
mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has
received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has
become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI
adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the
neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking
neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel
Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation
that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi
2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and
instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust
fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the
established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.

### [8] [IAD-R1: Reinforcing Consistent Reasoning in Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09178)
*Yanhui Li,Yunkang Cao,Chengliang Liu,Yuan Xiong,Xinghui Dong,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAD-R1是一种通用的后训练框架，显著提升了不同架构和参数规模的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在工业异常检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中缺陷样本稀缺，传统方法受限，而现有VLMs的性能不足。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：PA-SFT阶段利用高质量Chain-of-Thought数据集增强异常感知能力；SC-GRPO阶段通过奖励函数实现从‘异常感知’到‘异常解释’的飞跃。

Result: 在7种VLMs上显著提升性能，平均准确率最高提升43.3%，0.5B参数模型在零样本设置下超越GPT-4.1和Claude-Sonnet-4。

Conclusion: IAD-R1框架有效且优越，相关资源将公开。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing,
yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods
to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their
performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this
challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to
VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially
enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage
training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT)
stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset
(Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and
establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group
Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward
functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly
Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves
significant improvements across 7 VLMs, attaining up to 43.3% enhancement in
average accuracy on 6 industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets. Notably,
the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models
including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the
effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model
weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.

### [9] [A Neurosymbolic Framework for Interpretable Cognitive Attack Detection in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09185)
*Rongqian Chen,Allison Andreyev,Yanming Xiu,Mahdi Imani,Bin Li,Maria Gorlatova,Gang Tan,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADAR是一种新型神经符号方法，用于检测AR中的认知攻击，结合了视觉语言模型和粒子滤波技术，提高了检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AR的普及，认知攻击通过操纵AR内容影响用户感知，现有方法在语义推理和可解释性上存在不足。

Method: CADAR融合多模态视觉语言输入，构建感知图表示，并利用粒子滤波进行统计推理。

Result: 实验表明，CADAR在AR攻击场景中的准确率比基线方法提高了10.7%。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法在认知攻击检测中具有高效性和可解释性的潜力。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on
the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter
AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing
attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are
restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning
capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which
function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper,
we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection
in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a
symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge,
salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables
particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method
-- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of
pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle
filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy
improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack
scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and
interpretable cognitive attack detection.

*Abdolazim Rezaei,Mehdi Sookhak,Mahboobeh Haghparast*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-MoE框架通过将视觉数据转化为隐私保护的文本描述，解决了智能交通系统中隐私与数据效用的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统中AI摄像头的普及引发了隐私与数据需求的冲突，现有方法（如模糊或加密）效果不足。

Method: 结合Mixture-of-Experts架构和强化学习代理，生成兼具语义准确性和隐私保护的文本描述。

Result: 实验显示RL-MoE将重放攻击成功率降至9.4%，同时生成更丰富的文本内容。

Conclusion: RL-MoE为隐私敏感领域提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，推动了更安全的智能城市和自动驾驶网络。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the
fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as
blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable
trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction
attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we
propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into
privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image
transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic
accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of
replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously
generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a
practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in
privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and
autonomous vehicle networks.

Result: 在多样性和质量上优于GAN、VAE、GMM和KDE，分类准确率达94%和96%，评估指标（FID、IS、SSIM、PSNR）优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了合成深度人脸的质量和多样性，为情感计算提供了高质量数据集。

Abstract: Affective computing faces a major challenge: the lack of high-quality,
diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions. We
propose a framework for synthetic depth face generation using an optimized GAN
with Knowledge Distillation (EMA teacher models) to stabilize training, improve
quality, and prevent mode collapse. We also apply Genetic Algorithms to evolve
GAN latent vectors based on image statistics, boosting diversity and visual
quality for target emotions. The approach outperforms GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE in
both diversity and quality. For classification, we extract and concatenate LBP,
HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features, achieving 94% and 96%
accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation using FID, IS, SSIM, and PSNR shows
consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is pivotal for post-training
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning in
plain-text large language models, which mainly requires instruction datasets to
enable model instruction-following ability, VIF also requires multimodal data
to enable joint visual and textual understanding; therefore, it typically
requires more data. Consequently, VIF imposes stricter data selection
challenges: the method must scale efficiently to handle larger data demands
while ensuring the quality of both visual and textual content, as well as their
alignment. Despite its critical impact on performance, data selection for VIF
remains an understudied area. In this paper, we propose $\Delta$-AttnMask. This
data-efficient framework quantifies sample quality through attention-guided
masking of the model's hidden states, jointly evaluating image-text pairs
without requiring domain labels, auxiliary models, or extra training. By
computing loss differences ($\Delta$) between the original states and states
masked using high-attention regions, $\Delta$-AttnMask intrinsically assesses
sample quality. Experiments across multiple VLMs and datasets show that
$\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data,
accelerating training by 5x while surpassing full-dataset baselines by +10.1%
in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design ensures broad
applicability across modalities and architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有源自由领域自适应（SFDA）方法在仅使用单类（中性表情）目标数据时的局限性，以及图像生成的不稳定性和计算成本问题。

Method: 在潜在空间中预训练翻译器，通过优化表情一致性和风格感知目标，保留表情信息；随后仅使用中性目标数据适配翻译器，无需源数据或图像合成。

Result: PFT避免了面部表情生成的复杂性和噪声，生成优化的分类嵌入，同时减少了计算开销，仅需适配模型的一部分。

Conclusion: PFT是一种高效、轻量级的SFDA方法，适用于仅含中性表情的目标数据场景，优于基于图像翻译的方法。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) models are employed in many video-based
affective computing applications, such as human-computer interaction and
healthcare monitoring. However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle
expressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in
real-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source
model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,
storage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging
scenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled
target data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods
are not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.
Further, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions
can be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized
feature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image
translation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent
space. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform
the subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.
Expression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression
consistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on
neutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By
translating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face
expression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for
classification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces
computational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part
of the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed
transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit
emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress,
current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the
generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their
reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional
states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic
benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities
of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and
\textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for
MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific
questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight
emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with
hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a
multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced
MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key
insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional
intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$
recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark.
\ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional
intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while
specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance
through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion,
we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional
intelligence in the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种四轴评估框架和改进的递归重写策略（BSD），用于更准确地评估和提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对抗性提示的攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估标准可能高估对抗性提示的成功率，且安全机制未能有效阻止有害输出。

Method: 引入四轴评估框架（输入相关性、输入OOD强度、输出有害性、输出拒绝率），并提出BSD策略，通过语义对齐子任务和OOD信号优化提示。

Result: BSD在13个MLLMs中显著提高了攻击成功率和有害性，分别提升67%和21%。

Conclusion: 当前多模态安全系统存在未被充分认识的弱点，BSD策略揭示了其漏洞。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language
reasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a
serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of
harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success
rates, many responses classified as "successful" are actually benign, vague, or
unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current
evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To
address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that
considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output
harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective
jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:
highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those
that are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.
However, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade
filters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a
recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).
The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned
sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the
inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source
MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful
outputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success
rates by $67\%$ and harmfulness by $21\%$, revealing a previously
underappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手写数学表达式识别（HMER）领域因数据稀缺和标注成本高而受限的问题。

Method: 通过开发可扩展的数据引擎，结合有限手写公式和大规模LaTeX渲染公式，构建Tex80M数据集，并训练模型TexTeller。

Result: TexTeller在几乎所有基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 公开模型、数据集和代码，推动HMER领域进一步发展。

Abstract: Large foundation models have achieved significant performance gains through
scalable training on massive datasets. However, the field of
\textbf{H}andwritten \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{E}xpression
\textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily
due to the arduous and costly process of manual annotation. To bridge this gap,
we propose a novel method integrating limited handwritten formulas with
large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas by developing a scalable data engine to
generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the
largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80
million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller},
the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a
relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined
pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly
release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further
research building upon our contributions.

TL;DR: GDAGS提出了一种基于梯度方向感知的自适应密度控制框架，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的过重建和过密集问题，显著降低了内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法在复杂场景中存在过重建和过密集问题，导致内存开销增加和渲染质量下降。

Method: GDAGS通过梯度一致性比（GCR）和非线性动态加权机制，实现梯度方向感知的密度控制，优化高斯分布。

Result: GDAGS在多种真实场景基准测试中表现优异，渲染质量提升，内存消耗减少50%。

Conclusion: GDAGS有效解决了3D高斯泼溅的关键问题，为实时逼真渲染提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced
novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time
photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical
limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when
persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during
density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that
prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of
Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to
redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases
memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present
Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware
adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key
innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized
gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant
versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting
mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.
Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting
operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant
concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS
promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion
while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive
evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS
achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating
over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact
scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized
Gaussians utilization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理评估框架过于关注粗粒度任务完成，忽视了细粒度控制能力的重要性。

Method: 提出了多平台框架FineState-Bench，包含2257个任务基准和四阶段指标，并开发了视觉诊断助手（VDA）进行定量分析。

Result: 实验显示最先进模型的细粒度交互准确率仅为32.8%，理想视觉定位可提升性能14.9%。

Conclusion: 当前GUI代理的主要瓶颈是基础视觉定位能力，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technology,
Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated tremendous potential
for autonomously managing daily tasks through natural language instructions.
However, current evaluation frameworks for GUI agents suffer from fundamental
flaws: existing benchmarks overly focus on coarse-grained task completion while
neglecting fine-grained control capabilities crucial for real-world
applications. To address this, we introduce FineState-Bench, the first
evaluation and diagnostic standard for fine-grained GUI proxy operations,
designed to quantify fine-grained control. This multi-platform (desktop, Web,
mobile) framework includes 2257 task benchmarks in four components and uses a
four-phase indicator for comprehensive perception-to-control assessment. To
analyze perception and positioning for refined operations, we developed the
plug-and-play Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA), enabling the first
quantitative decoupling analysis of these capabilities. Experimental results on
our benchmark show that the most advanced models achieve only 32.8%
fine-grained interaction accuracy. Using our VDA in controlled experiments,
quantifying the impact of visual capabilities, we showed that ideal visual
localization boosts Gemini-2.5-Flash's success rate by 14.9\%. Our diagnostic
framework confirms for the first time that the primary bottleneck for current
GUI proxies is basic visual positioning capability.All resources are fully

Motivation: 解决现有隐私保护方法因粗粒度分割导致可用性降低的问题，特别是针对盲人和低视力用户。

Method: 结合细粒度分割和数据驱动的风险评分机制，选择性屏蔽高风险隐私信息。

Result: 在BIV-Priv-Seg数据集上测试，FiGPriv保留26%的图像内容，提升VLM响应能力11%，识别能力45%。

Conclusion: FiGPriv在保护隐私的同时显著提升了视觉语言模型的可用性和功能性。

Abstract: As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become
more prevalent, concerns over user privacy have grown, particularly for blind
and low vision users who may unknowingly capture personal private information
in their images. Existing privacy protection methods rely on coarse-grained
segmentation, which uniformly masks entire private objects, often at the cost
of usability. In this work, we propose FiGPriv, a fine-grained privacy
protection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information
while preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained
segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. We evaluate our
framework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26%
of image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by
11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection.

Motivation: 现有输入自适应机制在减少计算量时会导致性能显著下降，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 1. 选择性处理全景视图；2. 基于重要性的自适应阈值提前退出；3. 缓存机制避免重复处理。

Result: 在七个VLN基准测试中，计算量减少超过2倍，且性能未显著下降。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了模型效率，适用于计算资源有限的实际场景。

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of
history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction,
these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most
appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved
performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical
settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel
input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show
that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without
substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three
adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial
efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an
agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based
adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal
efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of
views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we
demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three
off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is

Conclusion: SegDAC通过对象中心分解和动态分割选择，显著提升了视觉强化学习的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

Conclusion: Lung-DDPM+能高效生成高质量肺部CT图像，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been playing an important role in
various domains. Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and
diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,
such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing
generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and
anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address
these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous
model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary
DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a
better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on
the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves
8$\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\times$ lower
GPU memory consumption, and 14$\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.
Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.
We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing
the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the
proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can
effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules,
highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor
synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging. The code and pretrained
models are available at https://github.com/Manem-Lab/Lung-DDPM-PLUS.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication poses a
significant challenge, requiring frameworks that can accurately interpret
complex multimodal gestures. To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net,
a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically
fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed
approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities
synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network,
features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based
fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the
outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble
classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments
demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for
Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse
spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and

Conclusion: 任务特定网络设计显著提升CSLR性能，为后续研究奠定新基准。

Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges,
including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel
sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these
issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a
dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we
propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head
self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based
skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a
Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that
captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to
comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging
Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The
proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on
the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US
task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work.
In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th
in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings
validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed
for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance
improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research. The source

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中标注者间的变异性影响结果准确性，尤其是边界模糊的病变（如恶性皮肤病变）。研究旨在量化这种变异性并探索其临床应用。

Method: 构建IMA++数据集，分析标注者、恶性程度、工具和技能对变异性的影响；利用IAA作为软特征，结合多任务学习提升模型性能。

Result: 发现IAA与恶性程度显著相关（p<0.001）；IAA可从图像预测（MAE=0.108）；多任务学习使平衡准确率提升4.2%。

Conclusion: IAA可作为临床特征提升模型性能，研究为医学图像分割中的变异性提供了量化方法和应用框架。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability
due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and
tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated
or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are
particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In
this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion
segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due
to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically
significant (p<0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA),
measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that
IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a
mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by
utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning
objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across
multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic
datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/sfu-mial/skin-IAV.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式骨骼姿势和启发式跨身份调整，难以实现高保真、细节丰富的跨身份运动迁移。X-UniMotion旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过自监督端到端框架，将多粒度运动编码为四个解耦的潜在标记（面部、身体和双手各一个），并结合DiT生成模型和辅助解码器优化嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，X-UniMotion在运动保真度和身份保留方面优于现有方法，生成高度表达的动画。

Conclusion: X-UniMotion提供了一种高效且表达力强的运动表示方法，适用于跨身份运动迁移任务。

Abstract: We present X-UniMotion, a unified and expressive implicit latent
representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions,
body poses, and hand gestures. Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely
on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our
approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a
compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression,
one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly
expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed
cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses,
and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised,
end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent
representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on
large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is
enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D
renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we
guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained,
semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments
show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly
expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.

*Kang Ni,Minrui Zou,Yuxuan Li,Xiang Li,Kehua Guo,Ming-Ming Cheng,Yimian Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenoDet V2提出了一种新的变换域特征解构和调制方法，通过注意力架构和振幅-相位互补机制，显著提升了SAR目标检测性能，同时降低了模型复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAR目标检测中相干噪声的普遍影响，现有方法多基于空间域特征分析或增强，缺乏对变换域特征的探索。

Method: 设计了一种注意力架构，通过频带互调制机制利用振幅和相位信息的互补性，实现特征解构和调制。

Result: 在多个SAR数据集上表现优异，SARDet-100K数据集上比DenoDet V1提升0.8%，模型复杂度减半。

Conclusion: DenoDet V2通过变换域特征调制和互补机制，显著提升了性能并降低了复杂度，为SAR目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object
detection lies in the pervasive influence of coherent noise. As a common
practice, most existing methods, whether handcrafted approaches or deep
learning-based methods, employ the analysis or enhancement of object
spatial-domain characteristics to achieve implicit denoising. In this paper, we
propose DenoDet V2, which explores a completely novel and different perspective
to deconstruct and modulate the features in the transform domain via a
carefully designed attention architecture. Compared to DenoDet V1, DenoDet V2
is a major advancement that exploits the complementary nature of amplitude and
phase information through a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, which
enables a reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra. Extensive
experiments on various SAR datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of DenoDet V2. Notably, DenoDet V2 achieves a significant 0.8\%
improvement on SARDet-100K dataset compared to DenoDet V1, while reducing the
model complexity by half. The code is available at

Abstract: Drones operating in complex environments face a significant threat from thin
obstacles, such as steel wires and kite strings at the submillimeter level,
which are notoriously difficult for conventional sensors like RGB cameras,
LiDAR, and depth cameras to detect. This paper introduces SkyShield, an
event-driven, end-to-end framework designed for the perception of submillimeter
scale obstacles. Drawing upon the unique features that thin obstacles present
in the event stream, our method employs a lightweight U-Net architecture and an
innovative Dice-Contour Regularization Loss to ensure precise detection.
Experimental results demonstrate that our event-based approach achieves mean F1
Score of 0.7088 with a low latency of 21.2 ms, making it ideal for deployment
on edge and mobile platforms.

Abstract: This paper presents a low cost, on premise system for autonomous backyard
bird monitoring in Belgian urban gardens. A motion triggered IP camera uploads
short clips via FTP to a local server, where frames are sampled and birds are
localized with Detectron2; cropped regions are then classified by an
EfficientNet-B3 model fine tuned on a 40-species Belgian subset derived from a
larger Kaggle corpus. All processing runs on commodity hardware without a
discrete GPU, preserving privacy and avoiding cloud fees. The physical feeder
uses small entry ports (30 mm) to exclude pigeons and reduce nuisance triggers.
Detector-guided cropping improves classification accuracy over raw-frame
classification. The classifier attains high validation performance on the
curated subset (about 99.5 percent) and delivers practical field accuracy
(top-1 about 88 percent) on held-out species, demonstrating feasibility for
citizen-science-grade biodiversity logging at home.

Result: 数据集覆盖800多个真实驾驶场景，包含丰富的交互行为，并建立了3D姿态预测基准。

Conclusion: Waymo-3DSkelMo为复杂城市环境中人类行为理解提供了基础资源。

Abstract: Large-scale high-quality 3D motion datasets with multi-person interactions
are crucial for data-driven models in autonomous driving to achieve
fine-grained pedestrian interaction understanding in dynamic urban
environments. However, existing datasets mostly rely on estimating 3D poses
from monocular RGB video frames, which suffer from occlusion and lack of
temporal continuity, thus resulting in unrealistic and low-quality human
motion. In this paper, we introduce Waymo-3DSkelMo, the first large-scale
dataset providing high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with
explicit interaction semantics, derived from the Waymo Perception dataset. Our
key insight is to utilize 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance the
quality of the 3D pose sequences extracted from the raw LiDRA point clouds. The
dataset covers over 14,000 seconds across more than 800 real driving scenarios,
including rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene (with up to
250 agents in the largest scene). Furthermore, we establish 3D pose forecasting
benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, and the results demonstrate its
value as a foundational resource for future research on fine-grained human
behavior understanding in complex urban environments. The dataset and code will
be available at https://github.com/GuangxunZhu/Waymo-3DSkelMo

Motivation: 路缘坡道对城市无障碍至关重要，但现有数据集在规模或质量上不足，限制了检测模型的性能。

Method: 第一阶段利用政府数据自动标注21万张谷歌街景图；第二阶段基于标注数据训练改进的ConvNeXt V2模型。

Result: 生成数据集精度94.0%，召回率92.5%；检测模型AP达0.9236，远超之前工作。

Conclusion: 研究首次提供了大规模高质量路缘坡道数据集、基准和模型，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Curb ramps are critical for urban accessibility, but robustly detecting them
in images remains an open problem due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality
datasets. While prior work has attempted to improve data availability with
crowdsourced or manually labeled data, these efforts often fall short in either
quality or scale. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a two-stage pipeline
called RampNet to scale curb ramp detection datasets and improve model
performance. In Stage 1, we generate a dataset of more than 210,000 annotated
Google Street View (GSV) panoramas by auto-translating government-provided curb
ramp location data to pixel coordinates in panoramic images. In Stage 2, we
train a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) from the generated
dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate both stages of our
pipeline, we compare to manually labeled panoramas. Our generated dataset
achieves 94.0% precision and 92.5% recall, and our detection model reaches
0.9236 AP -- far exceeding prior work. Our work contributes the first
large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model.

TL;DR: GOAL是一个基于生成流的框架，通过结合LLM增强的全场景语义地图，建模室内环境的语义分布，显著提升了ObjectNav任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖确定性模型完成语义地图，忽略了室内布局的不确定性，限制了泛化能力。GOAL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用LLM推断空间先验，将其编码为二维高斯场并注入目标地图，通过生成流模型实现更通用的语义补全。

Result: 在MP3D和Gibson数据集上达到SOTA性能，并在HM3D上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GOAL通过生成流模型和LLM先验的结合，显著提升了ObjectNav任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a
specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of
the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to
complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts
and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work,
we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic
distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with
LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred
from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian
fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into
the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D
and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D. Codes
and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/Badi-Li/GOAL.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新视觉任务，同时预测高级动作语义和细粒度身体部位接触区域，并提出了框架PaIR-Net和数据集PaIR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能同时建模动作语义和空间上下文，需填补这一空白。

Method: 提出PaIR-Net框架，包含CPAM、PGCS和IIM三个模块，用于识别接触相关身体部位、像素级接触分割和全局关系整合。

Result: PaIR-Net显著优于基线方法，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: PaIR-Net和PaIR数据集为动作与场景交互的联合建模提供了有效工具。

Abstract: People control their bodies to establish contact with the environment. To
comprehensively understand actions across diverse visual contexts, it is
essential to simultaneously consider \textbf{what} action is occurring and
\textbf{where} it is happening. Current methodologies, however, often
inadequately capture this duality, typically failing to jointly model both
action semantics and their spatial contextualization within scenes. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel vision task that simultaneously predicts
high-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions. Our
proposed framework, PaIR-Net, comprises three key components: the Contact Prior
Aware Module (CPAM) for identifying contact-relevant body parts, the
Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS) for pixel-wise contact segmentation, and
the Interaction Inference Module (IIM) responsible for integrating global
interaction relationships. To facilitate this task, we present PaIR (Part-aware
Interaction Representation), a comprehensive dataset containing 13,979 images
that encompass 654 actions, 80 object categories, and 17 body parts.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that PaIR-Net significantly outperforms
baseline approaches, while ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each
architectural component. The code and dataset will be released upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Motion Prompt Tuning（MPT）的新方法，通过运动提示生成和组适配器设计，将大型预训练模型（LMs）适应于微表情识别（MER）任务，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别（MER）在情感计算领域具有重要应用，但由于标注困难导致训练样本稀缺，且现有大型预训练模型难以捕捉微表情的短暂和细微运动特征。

Method: 提出MPT方法，包括运动放大和高斯标记化的运动提示生成，以及插入组适配器以增强模型在MER任务中的表现。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的MER数据集上的实验表明，MPT方法性能优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MPT方法通过运动提示和组适配器设计，成功将LMs适应于MER任务，为微表情识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in the affective computing
field due to its wide application in medical diagnosis, lie detection, and
criminal investigation. Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression
(ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from
psychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a
scarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models.
While current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative
representations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to
capture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective
MER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to
adapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt
tuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion
magnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts
for LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into
the LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced
distinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted
on three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its
effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有方法在跨模态泛化和处理高分辨率或长时间输入时表现不佳，需要一种更高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: 利用灵活的局部单元和GLoRA机制，结合轻量级适配模块与现有Transformer架构（如ViT和SegFormer）集成，设计轻量级查询式掩码解码器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进的定位性能，为可扩展和模态无关的VML设定了新基准。

Conclusion: RelayFormer通过模块化设计和高效注意力机制，显著提升了视觉篡改定位的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual manipulation localization (VML) -- across both images and videos -- is
a crucial task in digital forensics that involves identifying tampered regions
in visual content. However, existing methods often lack cross-modal
generalization and struggle to handle high-resolution or long-duration inputs
efficiently.
  We propose RelayFormer, a unified and modular architecture for visual
manipulation localization across images and videos. By leveraging flexible
local units and a Global-Local Relay Attention (GLoRA) mechanism, it enables
scalable, resolution-agnostic processing with strong generalization. Our
framework integrates seamlessly with existing Transformer-based backbones, such
as ViT and SegFormer, via lightweight adaptation modules that require only
minimal architectural changes, ensuring compatibility without disrupting
pretrained representations.
  Furthermore, we design a lightweight, query-based mask decoder that supports
one-shot inference across video sequences with linear complexity. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art localization performance, setting a new baseline for scalable
and modality-agnostic VML. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的检索增强超分辨率方法（RASR），通过自动检索相关高分辨率参考图像提升超分辨率效果，解决了传统RefSR依赖人工配对的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RefSR方法依赖人工配对的参考图像，限制了实际应用。论文旨在通过自动检索相关参考图像，提升超分辨率的实用性和灵活性。

Method: 提出RASR框架，结合语义检索器和扩散模型生成器（RASRNet），自动检索相关参考图像并生成高分辨率结果。

Result: 在RASR-Flickr30数据集上，RASRNet比SISR基线提升0.38 dB PSNR和-0.0131 LPIPS，生成更真实的纹理。

Conclusion: 检索增强是连接学术研究和实际应用的有效方向，RASR为RefSR的实用化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) improves upon Single Image Super
Resolution (SISR) by leveraging high-quality reference images to enhance
texture fidelity and visual realism. However, a critical limitation of existing
RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image
pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To
overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new
and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant
high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality
input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as
enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where
category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily
collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we
construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike
prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides
per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further
propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever
with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based
on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with
semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet
consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131
LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight
retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between
academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Different forms of customized 2D avatars are widely used in gaming
applications, virtual communication, education, and content creation. However,
existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial expressions and
struggle to preserve identity across different expressions. We propose
GEN-AFFECT, a novel framework for personalized avatar generation that generates
expressive and identity-consistent avatars with a diverse set of facial
expressions. Our framework proposes conditioning a multimodal diffusion
transformer on an extracted identity-expression representation. This enables
identity preservation and representation of a wide range of facial expressions.
GEN-AFFECT additionally employs consistent attention at inference for
information sharing across the set of generated expressions, enabling the
generation process to maintain identity consistency over the array of generated
fine-grained expressions. GEN-AFFECT demonstrates superior performance compared
to previous state-of-the-art methods on the basis of the accuracy of the
generated expressions, the preservation of the identity and the consistency of
the target identity across an array of fine-grained facial expressions.

Conclusion: HyperKD通过知识蒸馏框架有效填补了光谱域差距，展示了在高光谱遥感分析中的潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled
datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and
reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using
satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral
remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the
scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel
knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned
representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective
development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical
knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a
simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across
different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building
upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi
foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.
HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by
introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel
alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function
tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral
domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for
geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly
improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction
fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover
classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction,
underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote
sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

Motivation: 现有方法将长视频简化为静态关键帧，忽略了时空关系和场景连续性，导致冗余和关键信息丢失。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Video-EM性能提升4-9%，且使用更少帧数。

Conclusion: Video-EM通过情景记忆建模和链式思维，显著提升了长视频理解的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with long-form videos due to context window limits. Consequently,
recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a
small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods
simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal
relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual
continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information,
diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To
address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework
inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate
robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as
isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered
episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics
necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore,
the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to
iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic
memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs.
Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench
benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly
competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective
baselines while utilizing fewer frames.

Conclusion: Animate-X++ 解决了角色动画的通用性和背景动态问题，显著提升了视频的真实感和适用性。

Abstract: Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a
reference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in
recent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which
usually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in
industries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could
only generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the
videos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute
this limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to
comprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose
sequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes
Animate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character
types, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,
we introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern
from the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former
leverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of
motion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,
while the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible
inputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we
introduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and
TI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this
approach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background
dynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new
Animated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of
Animate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X++.

people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those
who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and
generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing
individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still
needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network
(ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention
Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium
resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image
generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant
that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and
class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model
generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and
words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12,
respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating
high-quality images of Indian Sign Language alphabets, numbers, and 129 words.

*Junxian Li,Beining Xu,Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对视觉语言模型的新型输入感知后门攻击方法IAG，通过自适应触发器生成器将攻击目标的语义信息嵌入图像，实现隐蔽攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在视觉定位任务中的安全性问题，特别是后门攻击的潜在威胁。

Method: 使用文本条件U-Net生成自适应触发器，嵌入攻击目标的语义信息，并通过重建损失确保攻击的隐蔽性。

Result: 在InternVL-2.5-8B上ASR@0.5超过65%，且在Ferret-7B和LlaVA-1.5-7B上表现良好。

Conclusion: IAG方法在攻击效果和隐蔽性上表现出色，具有鲁棒性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant advancements in tasks
such as visual grounding, where they localize specific objects in images based
on natural language queries and images. However, security issues in visual
grounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of
backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor
attack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This
attack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,
regardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that
embeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the
original image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the
open-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we
utilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned
and clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating
attack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its
feasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches
over 65\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on
manipulating Ferret-7B and LlaVA-1.5-7B with very little accuracy decrease on
clean samples. Extensive specific experiments, such as ablation study and
potential defense, also indicate the robustness and transferability of our
attack.

TL;DR: COXNet是一种用于RGBT微小目标检测的新框架，通过跨层融合、动态对齐和优化标签分配策略，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机场景中RGBT图像微小目标检测的挑战，如空间错位、低光照和背景杂乱。

Method: 提出COXNet框架，包含跨层融合模块、动态对齐与尺度细化模块，以及基于GeoShape相似度的标签分配策略。

Result: 在RGBTDronePerson数据集上，mAP$_{50}$提升了3.32%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COXNet在复杂环境中表现出色，为RGBT微小目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in multimodal Red-Green-Blue-Thermal (RGBT) imagery is
a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly in surveillance, search
and rescue, and autonomous navigation. Drone-based scenarios exacerbate these
challenges due to spatial misalignment, low-light conditions, occlusion, and
cluttered backgrounds. Current methods struggle to leverage the complementary
information between visible and thermal modalities effectively. We propose
COXNet, a novel framework for RGBT tiny object detection, addressing these
issues through three core innovations: i) the Cross-Layer Fusion Module, fusing
high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and
spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module,
correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale
features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape
Similarity Measure for better localization. COXNet achieves a 3.32\% mAP$_{50}$
improvement on the RGBTDronePerson dataset over state-of-the-art methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness for robust detection in complex environments.

TL;DR: GoViG任务利用原始视觉数据生成导航指令，通过视觉预测和指令生成两个子任务，结合多模态大语言模型，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖结构化输入，限制了在未知和非结构化环境中的适应性。GoViG旨在仅通过视觉数据生成精确导航指令。

Method: 任务分解为视觉预测和指令生成，结合自回归多模态大语言模型，采用单次和交替推理策略。

Result: 在R2R-Goal数据集上表现优于现有方法，BLEU-4和CIDEr得分显著提升，且具有跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: GoViG通过视觉数据和多模态模型，实现了高效、适应性强的导航指令生成。

Abstract: We introduce Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation
(GoViG), a new task that aims to autonomously generate precise and contextually
coherent navigation instructions solely from egocentric visual observations of
initial and goal states. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on structured
inputs such as semantic annotations or environmental maps, GoViG exclusively
leverages raw egocentric visual data, substantially improving its adaptability
to unseen and unstructured environments. Our method addresses this task by
decomposing it into two interconnected subtasks: (1) visual forecasting, which
predicts intermediate visual states bridging the initial and goal views; and
(2) instruction generation, which synthesizes linguistically coherent
instructions grounded in both observed and anticipated visuals. These subtasks
are integrated within an autoregressive multimodal large language model trained
with tailored objectives to ensure spatial accuracy and linguistic clarity.
Furthermore, we introduce two complementary multimodal reasoning strategies,
one-pass and interleaved reasoning, to mimic incremental human cognitive
processes during navigation. To evaluate our method, we propose the R2R-Goal
dataset, combining diverse synthetic and real-world trajectories. Empirical
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores along with robust cross-domain
generalization.

Motivation: 当前的功能性MRI方法在预测IDH突变状态时受限于数据可用性和噪声问题，而现有方法忽略了大脑的层次结构和多尺度交互。

Method: 提出Hi-SMGNN框架，整合结构和形态连接组，采用多模态交互模块（Siamese网络和跨模态注意力）、多尺度特征融合机制和个性化模块划分策略。

Conclusion: Hi-SMGNN为IDH突变预测提供了一种更有效且可解释的方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is a crucial biomarker for
glioma prognosis. However, current prediction methods are limited by the low
availability and noise of functional MRI. Structural and morphological
connectomes offer a non-invasive alternative, yet existing approaches often
ignore the brain's hierarchical organisation and multiscale interactions. To
address this, we propose Hi-SMGNN, a hierarchical framework that integrates
structural and morphological connectomes from regional to modular levels. It
features a multimodal interaction module with a Siamese network and cross-modal
attention, a multiscale feature fusion mechanism for reducing redundancy, and a
personalised modular partitioning strategy to enhance individual specificity
and interpretability. Experiments on the UCSF-PDGM dataset demonstrate that
Hi-SMGNN outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models, showing improved
robustness and effectiveness in IDH mutation prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少医学成像中的辐射暴露，同时提升稀疏视图CBCT的图像质量。

Method: 将InDI概念从2D扩展到3D，通过迭代去噪直接从稀疏输入优化CBCT体积，并利用大规模伪CBCT数据集训练模型。

Result: 在CT-RATE测试集上，PSNR提升12.96 dB，辐射剂量减少8倍，性能与3D U-Net相当，且能泛化到新扫描仪。

Conclusion: MInDI-3D在临床评估中表现优异，适用于患者定位并保留肿瘤边界，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first
3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam
Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation
exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full
3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising
process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further
contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from
chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We
performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics,
scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11
clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10)
dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE
pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in
imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that
performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the
performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across
distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner
geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning
across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

TL;DR: CitySeg是一种用于城市规模点云语义分割的基础模型，通过结合文本模态实现开放词汇分割和零样本推理，解决了数据分布不均和语义标签差异问题，并在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Method: 提出数据预处理规则、局部-全局交叉注意力网络、分层分类策略、两阶段训练策略和铰链损失。

Result: 在九个封闭集基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并首次实现不依赖视觉信息的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: CitySeg通过多模态和分层策略显著提升了城市规模点云分割的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification
of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive
3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the
limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to
reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose
CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation
that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and
zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of
non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data
preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to
enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To
resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a
hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established
according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the
graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between
categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ
hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot
generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual
information.

Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video
abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible,
well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models
demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid
video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to
represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce
Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a top-down
approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by
bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent
abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and
introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative
planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across
five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation
models. Code will be released at: https://github.com/GenVerse/Paper2Video

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的少样本深度伪造检测方法FTNet，通过利用少量样本显著提升检测性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法在未知样本上表现不佳，而现实场景中这些样本仍可用于分析，因此将其视为少样本任务更合理。

Method: 提出FTNet，仅需一个伪造样本作为参考，无需训练或参数更新，通过比较测试样本与已知样本的相似性进行分类。

Result: 在29种生成模型的图像上测试，FTNet平均性能提升8.7%，达到新SoTA。

Conclusion: FTNet为深度伪造检测提供了新思路，利用失败样本可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection studies often treat unseen sample detection as a
``zero-shot" task, training on images generated by known models but
generalizing to unknown ones. A key real-world challenge arises when a model
performs poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for
analysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot" task,
where effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant
improvement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding,
deepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world
distributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network
(FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet
differs from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for
training. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set,
mimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be
gathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation,
each test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is
classified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a
comprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative
models and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\%
compared to existing methods. This work introduces a fresh perspective on
real-world deepfake detection: when the model struggles to generalize on a
few-shot sample, leveraging the failed samples leads to better performance.

Motivation: 现有方法在长期点跟踪中难以保持运动一致性或仅限于2D运动，因此需要一种更高效且支持3D跟踪的解决方案。

Method: 采用InvNeRF架构优化聚合函数，结合多尺度HexPlanes和高效像素采样算法，实现双向可变形-规范映射和快速推理。

Result: 在STIR和SCARE数据集上，2D跟踪精度提升50%，3D跟踪首次超越前馈方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在2D和3D点跟踪中均表现出色，为TTO领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We proposed a novel test-time optimisation (TTO) approach framed by a
NeRF-based architecture for long-term 3D point tracking. Most current methods
in point tracking struggle to obtain consistent motion or are limited to 2D
motion. TTO approaches frame the solution for long-term tracking as optimising
a function that aggregates correspondences from other specialised
state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the state-of-the-art on TTO, we propose
parametrising such a function with our new invertible Neural Radiance Field
(InvNeRF) architecture to perform both 2D and 3D tracking in surgical
scenarios. Our approach allows us to exploit the advantages of a
rendering-based approach by supervising the reprojection of pixel
correspondences. It adapts strategies from recent rendering-based methods to
obtain a bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, to efficiently handle a
defined workspace, and to guide the rays' density. It also presents our
multi-scale HexPlanes for fast inference and a new algorithm for efficient
pixel sampling and convergence criteria. We present results in the STIR and
SCARE datasets, for evaluating point tracking and testing the integration of
kinematic data in our pipeline, respectively. In 2D point tracking, our
approach surpasses the precision and accuracy of the TTO state-of-the-art
methods by nearly 50% on average precision, while competing with other
approaches. In 3D point tracking, this is the first TTO approach, surpassing
feed-forward methods while incorporating the benefits of a deformable
NeRF-based reconstruction.

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在大角度面部情况下难以保持身份一致性，主要由于缺乏有效的身份特征整合机制和针对大角度面部的数据集。

Method: 提出MoFE方法，结合三种专家（身份、语义、细节）动态捕捉面部特征；设计数据处理流程（面部约束和身份一致性）构建LFA数据集。

Result: 在LFA基准测试中，方法在面部相似性、FID和CLIP语义对齐上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MoFE方法和LFA数据集有效解决了大角度面部身份保持问题，为视频生成提供了新思路和资源。

Abstract: Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under
large facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in
exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT
structure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing
open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations.
First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically
combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to
capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The
identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic
expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves
pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to
mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline
centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face
Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial
regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features
across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial
angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this
pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from
existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with
annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate
that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior
SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The
code and dataset will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/rain152/LFA-Video-Generation.

Conclusion: R2R方法有效解决了图像协调问题，并开源了代码、数据集和模型权重。

Abstract: The goal of image harmonization is to adjust the foreground in a composite
image to achieve visual consistency with the background. Recently, latent
diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable
results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail
preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic
datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to
capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization
capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting
information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach
preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,
generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model
R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in
the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.
To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with
Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the
foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background
regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random
Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a
suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and
challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic
dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our
dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our
code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.

Result: 实验证明该方法对多种图像生成器生成的AI图像检测有效。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督方法在通用AI生成图像检测中表现出色。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI generative models, the visual quality of
AI-generated images (AIIs) has become increasingly close to natural images,
which inevitably raises security concerns. Most AII detectors often employ the
conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs
(generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection
performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed
a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly
detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a
generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use
the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing
flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by
applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for
training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images,
optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by
various image generators.

Conclusion: 新方法在几何装配中表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new shape-matching methodology, combinative matching,
to combine interlocking parts for geometric shape assembly. Previous methods
for geometric assembly typically rely on aligning parts by finding identical
surfaces between the parts as in conventional shape matching and registration.
In contrast, we explicitly model two distinct properties of interlocking
shapes: 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy.' Our method
thus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface
shapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each
other. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation
by estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks. The
proposed approach significantly reduces local ambiguities in matching and
allows a robust combination of parts in assembly. Experimental results on
geometric assembly benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method,
consistently outperforming the state of the art. Project page:

Conclusion: GazeLT通过有效利用人类视觉注意力，显著提升了长尾疾病分类的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we present GazeLT, a human visual attention
integration-disintegration approach for long-tailed disease classification. A
radiologist's eye gaze has distinct patterns that capture both fine-grained and
coarser level disease related information. While interpreting an image, a
radiologist's attention varies throughout the duration; it is critical to
incorporate this into a deep learning framework to improve automated image
interpretation. Another important aspect of visual attention is that apart from
looking at major/obvious disease patterns, experts also look at
minor/incidental findings (few of these constituting long-tailed classes)
during the course of image interpretation. GazeLT harnesses the temporal aspect
of the visual search process, via an integration and disintegration mechanism,
to improve long-tailed disease classification. We show the efficacy of GazeLT
on two publicly available datasets for long-tailed disease classification,
namely the NIH-CXR-LT (n=89237) and the MIMIC-CXR-LT (n=111898) datasets.
GazeLT outperforms the best long-tailed loss by 4.1% and the visual
attention-based baseline by 21.7% in average accuracy metrics for these
datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/lordmoinak1/gazelt.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于U-Net的深度学习模型，用于自动化分割脑组织照片中的组织，性能接近人工标注水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要昂贵的人工干预进行脑组织分割，限制了大规模分析。

Method: 使用U-Net架构，结合1,414张手动标注图像和2,000张合成图像进行训练。

Result: 模型在未见过的照片上表现优异，Dice分数中位数超过0.98，接近人工标注水平。

Conclusion: 该工具公开可用，为脑组织分析提供了高效自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in image registration and machine learning have recently enabled
volumetric analysis of \emph{postmortem} brain tissue from conventional
photographs of coronal slabs, which are routinely collected in brain banks and
neuropathology laboratories worldwide. One caveat of this methodology is the
requirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently
requires costly manual intervention. In this article, we present a deep
learning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies
on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of
\textit{(i)}1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue,
from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites; and
\textit{(ii)}~2,000 synthetic images with randomized contrast and corresponding
masks generated from MRI scans for improved generalizability to unseen
photographic setups. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not
seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual
labels -- including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved
a median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4~mm, and 95\%
Hausdorff distance under 1.60~mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels.

*Xuejun Huang,Xinyi Liu,Yi Wan,Zhi Zheng,Bin Zhang,Mingtao Xiong,Yingying Pei,Yongjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkySplat是一种自监督框架，将RPC模型集成到通用3DGS流程中，显著提升了稀疏卫星图像的三维重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法不适用于卫星图像，且通用性差，无法处理多时相稀疏卫星图像中的几何约束不足、瞬态物体和辐射不一致问题。

Method: 提出SkySplat框架，结合RPC模型和通用3DGS，引入Cross-Self Consistency Module（CSCM）和多视角一致性聚合策略。

Result: SkySplat在DFC19数据集上MAE从13.18米降至1.80米，速度提升86倍，并在MVS3D基准测试中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SkySplat通过自监督和几何约束优化，显著提升了稀疏卫星图像的三维重建效率和精度。

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a
long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its
variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing
methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with
rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization
capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,
but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to
limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel
self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable
3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for
improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and
radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need
for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency
Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via
consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy
that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization
methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.
It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to
1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong
cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.

TL;DR: TRACE框架通过将3D点建模为刚性粒子，直接学习其平移旋转动力学系统，无需人工标签即可建模复杂动态3D场景的物理运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常因依赖物理模型或额外标签而难以学习复杂运动物理，TRACE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将每个3D点视为具有大小和方向的刚性粒子，直接学习其平移旋转动力学系统，并估计物理参数。

Result: 在多个动态数据集上表现优异，尤其在未来帧外推任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TRACE不仅能建模复杂物理运动，还能通过物理参数聚类轻松分割多个对象或部分。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and physical
information just from dynamic multi-view videos in the absence of any human
labels. By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or
integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail
to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as
object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the
motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is
that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and
orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system
for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters
to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three
existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets
demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the
task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that
multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the
learned physical parameters.

Conclusion: RayletDF方法在3D表面重建中表现出高效性和泛化能力，适用于点云或3D高斯数据。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface
reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from
RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often
computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed
method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance
field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our
pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet
distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work
together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet
distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface
points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from
point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional
generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward
pass across unseen datasets in testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的快速发展引发了对潜在滥用的担忧，现有检测方法在面对未见生成模型时性能显著下降，因为它们主要依赖模型特定的伪影。

Method: 提出Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE)，通过量化图像与标题引导重建之间的语义差异，作为区分真假图像的特征。

Result: 实验表明，SARE在GenImage和CommunityForensics等基准测试中表现优于现有基线，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SARE通过捕捉语义差异，能够跨多样生成模型实现鲁棒的假图像检测。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion-generated image detection has gained increasing
attention, as the rapid advancement of diffusion models has raised serious
concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have
achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when
facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models,
since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this
limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images.
Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity
to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely
Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic
difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The
hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully
capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts
during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images,
which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By
quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative
feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically
demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization,
outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and
CommunityForensics.

Motivation: 传统单数据集训练在新数据分布下表现不佳，尤其是在超声图像分析中，由于数据有限、声学阴影和斑点噪声等问题，构建通用框架成为必要。

Method: COME通过建立双结构-语义共享专家创建通用表示空间，并与源特定专家协作提取判别性特征，利用跨数据集经验分布和通用超声先验提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: COME通过协作异构专家和共享表示空间，有效解决了多数据集干扰问题，为超声图像分析提供了鲁棒的通用框架。

Abstract: Conventional single-dataset training often fails with new data distributions,
especially in ultrasound (US) image analysis due to limited data, acoustic
shadows, and speckle noise. Therefore, constructing a universal framework for
multi-heterogeneous US datasets is imperative. However, a key challenge arises:
how to effectively mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving
dataset-specific discriminative features for robust downstream task? Previous
approaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain
adaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance
when applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal
Collaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME).
Specifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that
create a universal representation space and then collaborate with
source-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing
complementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging
cross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for
small-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three
evaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration
datasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP
improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Our project is available at:

Motivation: 传统分子对接方法依赖图表示和语言模型编码器，忽略了关键的几何信息，导致口袋定位和结合构象不准确。CWFBind旨在通过局部曲率特征和动态权重机制解决这一问题。

Method: CWFBind在特征提取阶段整合局部曲率描述符，增强蛋白质和配体的几何表示。同时，引入度感知权重机制和动态半径策略，优化消息传递和口袋预测。

Result: CWFBind在多个对接基准测试中表现出色，实现了精度与效率的平衡。

Conclusion: CWFBind通过几何特征和动态权重机制，显著提升了分子对接的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the binding conformation of small-molecule ligands to
protein targets is a critical step in rational drug design. Although recent
deep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and
accuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language
model-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information,
resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding
conformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and
accurate docking method based on local curvature features. Specifically, we
integrate local curvature descriptors during the feature extraction phase to
enrich the geometric representation of both proteins and ligands, complementing
existing chemical, sequence, and structural features. Furthermore, we embed
degree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing
the model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction
strengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction,
CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced
loss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and
key residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind
achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a
balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: 结论是合成图像数据能有效弥补真实世界数据的不足，并在多模态生成任务中展现出强大的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong
performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.
Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance
open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question
remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural
source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?
In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they
can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy
or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.
Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often
contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text
descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds
and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image
alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale
synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image
data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we
fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.
In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and
challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which
increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and
Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and
generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance
across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other
foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains
across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.

Motivation: 单目标跟踪（SOT）中的相似物体干扰（SOI）长期被忽视，但其对跟踪性能有显著影响。论文旨在量化SOI的影响，并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过在线干扰掩蔽（OIM）实验量化SOI影响，构建SOIBench基准，并提出利用大规模视觉语言模型（VLM）作为外部认知引擎的新范式。

Result: 消除干扰源可显著提升跟踪性能（AUC增益达4.35）。现有视觉语言跟踪方法效果有限（AUC变化-0.26至+0.71），而新范式在语义认知引导下AUC增益达0.93。

Conclusion: SOIBench为语义认知跟踪研究提供了标准化平台，新范式显著优于现有方法，为跟踪研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation and
quantification of Similar Object Interference (SOI), a long-overlooked yet
critical bottleneck in Single Object Tracking (SOT). Through controlled Online
Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that
eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements
(AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a
primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of
external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural
language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the
first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI
challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective
judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise
semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking
finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively
exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or
even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we
propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as
external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB
trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic
cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant
advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a
standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking
research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers (ViTs)的自注意力机制缺乏显式的空间归纳偏置，导致在空间结构化任务上表现不佳。现有方法基于固定距离度量的空间衰减缺乏适应性。

Method: 提出SDT，引入CAG机制，动态生成数据依赖的空间衰减，结合曼哈顿距离的空间先验和学习到的内容表示。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K分类和生成任务上，SDT显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 数据依赖的空间衰减是增强ViTs空间注意力的新范式。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision, yet their
self-attention mechanism lacks explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to
suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing approaches
introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics,
applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting
adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large
language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX)
significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful
adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We
introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel
Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent
decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention
based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the
fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content
fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with
learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K
classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new
paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.

Result: MEUNet在重建精度和推理速度上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: AKCS和MACA的结合显著提升了压缩感知任务的性能。

Abstract: Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in image compressed sensing
(CS) task, namely reconstructing a high-fidelity image from its compressed
measurement. However, existing works are deficient inincoherent compressed
measurement at sensing phase and implicit measurement representations at
reconstruction phase, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we answer
two questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the
ill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements.
To this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and
theoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with
minimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks'
superiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents,
called explicit measurement representations. We propose a measurement-aware
cross attention (MACA) mechanism to learn implicit measurement representations.
We integrate AKCS and MACA into widely-used unfolding architecture to get a
measurement-enhanced unfolding network (MEUNet). Extensive experiences
demonstrate that our MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstruction accuracy and inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非对称多相机系统（如长焦-广角相机）的兴起挑战了传统立体匹配算法对视觉对称性的假设，导致匹配困难。

Method: 提出两阶段迭代体积融合网络（IVF-AStereo），先通过聚合拼接体积优化相关体积，再融合两者以增强细节。

Result: 在非对称场景下表现优异，对显著视觉不对称具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 实验证明该方法在分辨率与颜色退化的非对称立体匹配中有效。

Abstract: Stereo matching is vital in 3D computer vision, with most algorithms assuming
symmetric visual properties between binocular visions. However, the rise of
asymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this
assumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo
matching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we
explore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume
construction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume
experiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be
comprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the
two-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching
(IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the
correlation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine
details. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance
against significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on
benchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of
our approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a key scientific problem in machine learning: Given
a training set for an image classification task, can we train a generative
model on this dataset to enhance the classification performance? (i.e.,
closed-set generative data augmentation). We start by exploring the
distinctions and similarities between real images and closed-set synthetic
images generated by advanced generative models. Through extensive experiments,
we offer systematic insights into the effective use of closed-set synthetic
data for augmentation. Notably, we empirically determine the equivalent scale
of synthetic images needed for augmentation. In addition, we also show
quantitative equivalence between the real data augmentation and open-set
generative augmentation (generative models trained using data beyond the given
training set). While it aligns with the common intuition that real images are
generally preferred, our empirical formulation also offers a guideline to
quantify the increased scale of synthetic data augmentation required to achieve
comparable image classification performance. Our results on natural and medical
image datasets further illustrate how this effect varies with the baseline
training set size and the amount of synthetic data incorporated.

Motivation: 探索一种紧凑、可解释且准确的虹膜识别方法，作为深度学习的替代方案，适用于需要可解释性或数据有限的场景。

Method: 将归一化虹膜图像划分为网格，计算每个子区域的Betti0、Betti1及其比率，形成特征矩阵，结合逻辑回归、KNN和SVM进行分类，并与CNN对比。

Result: 逻辑回归的准确率为97.78% ± 0.82%，优于CNN（96.44% ± 1.32%）和其他基于特征的模型，拓扑特征表现出高精度和低方差。

Conclusion: 这是首次将数字同调理论的拓扑不变量用于虹膜识别，方法紧凑、可解释且高效，适用于安全关键领域及其他多学科应用。

Abstract: Objective - This study presents a biometric identification method based on
topological invariants from 2D iris images, representing iris texture via
formally defined digital homology and evaluating classification performance.
  Methods - Each normalized iris image (48x482 pixels) is divided into grids
(e.g., 6x54 or 3x27). For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their
ratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The
resulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN,
and SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions). A convolutional neural
network (CNN) is trained on raw images for comparison.
  Results - Logistic regression achieved 97.78 +/- 0.82% accuracy,
outperforming CNN (96.44 +/- 1.32%) and other feature-based models. The
topological features showed high accuracy with low variance.
  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal
digital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact,
interpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when
explainability or limited data is important. Beyond iris recognition, it can
apply to other biometrics, medical imaging, materials science, remote sensing,
and interpretable AI. It runs efficiently on CPU-only systems and produces
robust, explainable features valuable for security-critical domains.

TL;DR: WeatherPrompt提出了一种多模态学习范式，通过融合图像嵌入和文本上下文，建立天气不变的表示，解决了无人机视觉地理定位在天气扰动下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在天气扰动（如雨、雾）下性能显著下降，主要受限于对有限天气类别的依赖以及场景-天气特征解耦不足。

Method: 1) 提出无需训练的天气推理机制，利用现有多模态模型生成多天气文本描述；2) 设计动态门控机制，通过文本嵌入自适应调整视觉特征融合。

Result: 在多样天气条件下，WeatherPrompt的召回率优于现有方法，夜间条件下Recall@1提升13.37%，雾雪条件下提升18.69%。

Conclusion: WeatherPrompt通过多模态融合和动态特征解耦，显著提升了无人机在复杂天气下的地理定位性能。

Abstract: Visual geo-localization for drones faces critical degradation under weather
perturbations, \eg, rain and fog, where existing methods struggle with two
inherent limitations: 1) Heavy reliance on limited weather categories that
constrain generalization, and 2) Suboptimal disentanglement of entangled
scene-weather features through pseudo weather categories. We present
WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes
weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the
text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a
Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large
multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through
human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather,
and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the
scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the
dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight
and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized
by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and
image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather
conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate
that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall
rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it
improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog
and snow conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多曝光校正方法在处理单一曝光水平的图像时，难以应对由多样光照条件、拍摄环境和天气因素引起的类内变异性。

Method: 提出WEC-DG方法，包括曝光一致性对齐模块（ECAM）和曝光恢复与细节重建模块（EDRM），利用小波变换分离光与细节信息。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有算法，性能提升明显。

Conclusion: WEC-DG方法在复杂成像条件下具有更高的适应性和实用性，有效解决了曝光校正问题。

Abstract: Multi-exposure correction technology is essential for restoring images
affected by insufficient or excessive lighting, enhancing the visual experience
by improving brightness, contrast, and detail richness. However, current
multi-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing
intra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting
environments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured
at a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under
complex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure
Correction method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we
introduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment
Module (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure
consistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses
miscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to
recognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the
light-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the
Exposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes
low-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing
high-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain
details. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction
and enhances detail recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
algorithms, achieving significant performance improvements and validating its
effectiveness and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为诊断链（CoD）的框架，用于生成临床准确且可解释的放射学报告，通过诊断对话生成QA对，并利用大语言模型生成报告，同时设计了诊断和病灶定位模块以提高可解释性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成（RRG）方法在临床效果和可解释性方面表现不佳，尤其是对病灶属性的描述和结果的可信度不足。

Method: 提出CoD框架，通过诊断对话生成QA对提取关键发现，利用大语言模型生成报告，并设计诊断和病灶定位模块增强可解释性。采用全监督学习策略利用多源标注数据。

Result: CoD在两个RRG基准测试中优于专家和通用模型，并在可解释性方面表现出色，能准确将生成的句子与QA诊断和图像关联。

Conclusion: CoD框架在放射学报告生成中实现了临床准确性和可解释性，显著提升了报告质量和医生工作效率。

Abstract: Despite the progress of radiology report generation (RRG), existing works
face two challenges: 1) The performances in clinical efficacy are
unsatisfactory, especially for lesion attributes description; 2) the generated
text lacks explainability, making it difficult for radiologists to trust the
results. To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which
not only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides
basis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of
diagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically
accurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via
diagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language
model with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a
diagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated
sentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding
module is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the
working efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we
propose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to
leverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead
to 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a
evaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion
location and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist
models consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by
accurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF)系统，用于改进可控文本到图像(T2I)扩散模型的空间和外观控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控T2I模型在保留空间结构和捕捉细粒度条件（如物体姿态和场景布局）方面表现不佳。

Method: DRF通过外观反馈和生成反馈递归优化中间潜在表示，以更好地反映给定外观信息和用户意图。

Result: 实验表明，DRF能生成高质量、语义一致且结构一致的图像，支持类不变的结构-外观融合。

Conclusion: DRF有效提升了可控T2I模型的空间和外观控制能力，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Recent advancements in controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models,
such as Ctrl-X and FreeControl, have demonstrated robust spatial and appearance
control without requiring auxiliary module training. However, these models
often struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture
fine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address
these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF)
system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models.
The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that
recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given
appearance information and the user's intent. This dual-update mechanism guides
latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating
structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained
generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as
transferring human motion onto a tiger's form. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of our method in producing high-quality, semantically
coherent, and structurally consistent image generations. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/jwonkm/DRF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对幻觉问题的评估过于粗糙，且依赖人工或公共数据集，缺乏可扩展性和可控性。

Method: 提出自动化数据构建管道和分层幻觉诱导框架，构建SHALE基准，包含30K图像-指令对，覆盖12个视觉感知方面和6个知识领域。

Result: 实验显示主流LVLMs存在显著的事实性幻觉，并对语义扰动高度敏感。

Conclusion: SHALE基准为LVLMs的幻觉问题提供了细粒度和可扩展的评估工具。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer
from hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or
established world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality
hallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness
hallucination at a coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained
analysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks rely on costly manual curation or
reused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To
address these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline
that produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also
design a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input
perturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs,
we construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to
assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained
hallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction
pairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and
6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios.
Extensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality
hallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.

Abstract: This paper introduces BAAS, a new Extended Object Tracking (EOT) and
fusion-based label annotation framework for radar detections in autonomous
driving. Our framework utilizes Bayesian-based tracking, smoothing and
eventually fusion methods to provide veritable and precise object trajectories
along with shape estimation to provide annotation labels on the detection level
under various supervision levels. Simultaneously, the framework provides
evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled
data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or
combined with other modules to enable closed-loop continuous improvements. The
framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario
in terms of tracking performance and the label annotation errors. We
demonstrate the functionality of the proposed approach for varying dynamic
objects and class types

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有头像生成方法在实时外观编辑方面的挑战，尤其是几何和全局外观的隐式表示问题。

Method: 使用3D高斯模型绑定FLAME网格，分离纹理图像捕捉全局外观，并通过网格感知的UV映射优化纹理空间对应关系。

Result: 在NeRSemble数据集上，SVG-Head实现了高保真渲染，并首次支持实时外观编辑。

Conclusion: SVG-Head为头像生成提供了高保真和实时编辑的新解决方案。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in
computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent
advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,
head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due
to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and
global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head
Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the
geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled
texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two
types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance
of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture
editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of
non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence
between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping
method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp
texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization
strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both
reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble
dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results,
but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian
head avatars and support real-time appearance editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在类到图像生成中虽FID得分高，但常生成失真或低质量图像，尤其是某些类别。FID忽略单个样本的感知质量，且CFG技术可能引入分布偏移和视觉伪影。

Method: 提出FaME方法，利用图像质量评估模型识别低质量生成样本，存储其采样轨迹，作为负引导以避开低质量区域。

Result: 在ImageNet上实验表明，FaME能一致提升视觉质量且不损害FID，并有望扩展到文本到图像生成。

Conclusion: FaME是一种无需训练、推理高效的方法，有效解决了扩散模型在感知质量上的不足。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in class-to-image
generation. However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores,
state-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images,
especially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global
distribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual
samples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance
generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing
outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its
misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work,
we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving
perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify
low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure
modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from
poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings
consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also
shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.

Motivation: 纯相机方法在BEV分割任务中性能落后于LiDAR-Camera融合方法，现有知识蒸馏方法通过模仿教师架构增加学生模型复杂度，导致推理成本上升。

Method: 引入轻量级TA网络，结合教师和学生的BEV表示，构建共享潜在空间，并通过Young不等式推导蒸馏损失，分解为教师-TA和TA-学生双路径。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，性能提升4.2% mIoU，优于其他最先进蒸馏方法45%。

Conclusion: BridgeTA通过TA网络和理论驱动的蒸馏损失，有效提升纯相机模型性能，同时保持低成本。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map segmentation is one of the most important and
challenging tasks in autonomous driving. Camera-only approaches have drawn
attention as cost-effective alternatives to LiDAR, but they still fall behind
LiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion-based methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been
explored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student
model by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference
cost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective
distillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and
Camera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the
student's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network
combines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared
latent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the
framework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's
Inequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into
teacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and
strengthening knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on the challenging
nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an
improvement of 4.2% mIoU over the Camera-only baseline, up to 45% higher than
the improvement of other state-of-the-art KD methods.

Conclusion: 提出的信息优化框架能有效减少误检，提高平面检测的准确性，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Plane detection from depth images is a crucial subtask with broad robotic
applications, often accomplished by iterative methods such as Random Sample
Consensus (RANSAC). While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic
guarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it
susceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly
prevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is
unknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this
limitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on
model information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the
observed depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability
distributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing
different candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated
random sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics
and noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each
model, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely
ground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective
mechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false
positive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be
ranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We
validate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that
our algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the
default Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our
algorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation,
which enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in
real-world data.

Result: 实验结果表明，SAD-Splat在分割精度和表示紧凑性之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: SAD-Splat为3D航空场景理解提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In the task of 3D Aerial-view Scene Semantic Segmentation (3D-AVS-SS),
traditional methods struggle to address semantic ambiguity caused by scale
variations and structural occlusions in aerial images. This limits their
segmentation accuracy and consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel 3D-AVS-SS approach named SAD-Splat. Our method introduces a Gaussian
point drop module, which integrates semantic confidence estimation with a
learnable sparsity mechanism based on the Hard Concrete distribution. This
module effectively eliminates redundant and semantically ambiguous Gaussian
points, enhancing both segmentation performance and representation compactness.
Furthermore, SAD-Splat incorporates a high-confidence pseudo-label generation
pipeline. It leverages 2D foundation models to enhance supervision when
ground-truth labels are limited, thereby further improving segmentation
accuracy. To advance research in this domain, we introduce a challenging
benchmark dataset: 3D Aerial Semantic (3D-AS), which encompasses diverse
real-world aerial scenes with sparse annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that SAD-Splat achieves an excellent balance between segmentation
accuracy and representation compactness. It offers an efficient and scalable
solution for 3D aerial scene understanding.

Motivation: 现有高性能模型在手部几何预测与图像外观覆盖上存在不完美，纹理对齐可能是一个未被充分利用的监督信号。

Method: 提出一个轻量级纹理模块，将像素观察嵌入UV纹理空间，并引入密集对齐损失，结合可微分渲染和已知拓扑的3D手部网格模型。

Result: 通过增强HaMeR模型，系统在精度和真实感上均有提升。

Conclusion: 纹理引导的监督在手部重建中具有显著价值。

Abstract: We revisit the role of texture in monocular 3D hand reconstruction, not as an
afterthought for photorealism, but as a dense, spatially grounded cue that can
actively support pose and shape estimation. Our observation is simple: even in
high-performing models, the overlay between predicted hand geometry and image
appearance is often imperfect, suggesting that texture alignment may be an
underused supervisory signal. We propose a lightweight texture module that
embeds per-pixel observations into UV texture space and enables a novel dense
alignment loss between predicted and observed hand appearances. Our approach
assumes access to a differentiable rendering pipeline and a model that maps
images to 3D hand meshes with known topology, allowing us to back-project a
textured hand onto the image and perform pixel-based alignment. The module is
self-contained and easily pluggable into existing reconstruction pipelines. To
isolate and highlight the value of texture-guided supervision, we augment
HaMeR, a high-performing yet unadorned transformer architecture for 3D hand
pose estimation. The resulting system improves both accuracy and realism,
demonstrating the value of appearance-guided alignment in hand reconstruction.

Conclusion: MCFM通过多对比融合增强特征表示，为产前筛查提供了更准确可靠的诊断工具，具有临床潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: Prenatal ultrasound is a key tool in evaluating fetal structural
development and detecting abnormalities, contributing to reduced perinatal
complications and improved neonatal survival. Accurate identification of
standard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and
personalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and
unclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for
fine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast
Fusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed
information from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower
layers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By
assigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast
conditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining
minimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a
curated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results
demonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a
minimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast
attention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,
contributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腮腺病变分割因病变大小和边界复杂性而具有挑战性，现有方法依赖精确提示且忽略专家知识。

Method: 提出PG-SAM模型，包括专家诊断文本引导的提示生成模块和跨序列注意力模块，结合多模态信息进行分割。

Result: 在三个独立临床中心验证中，PG-SAM达到最先进性能，证明了其临床适用性。

Conclusion: PG-SAM通过融合专家知识和跨序列信息，有效解决了腮腺病变分割的难题。

Abstract: Parotid gland lesion segmentation is essential for the treatment of parotid
gland diseases. However, due to the variable size and complex lesion
boundaries, accurate parotid gland lesion segmentation remains challenging.
Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) fine-tuning has shown remarkable
performance in the field of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, SAM's
interaction segmentation model relies heavily on precise lesion prompts
(points, boxes, masks, etc.), which are very difficult to obtain in real-world
applications. Besides, current medical image segmentation methods are
automatically generated, ignoring the domain knowledge of medical experts when
performing segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose the parotid
gland segment anything model (PG-SAM), an expert diagnosis text-guided SAM
incorporating expert domain knowledge for cross-sequence parotid gland lesion
segmentation. Specifically, we first propose an expert diagnosis report guided
prompt generation module that can automatically generate prompt information
containing the prior domain knowledge to guide the subsequent lesion
segmentation process. Then, we introduce a cross-sequence attention module,
which integrates the complementary information of different modalities to
enhance the segmentation effect. Finally, the multi-sequence image features and
generated prompts are feed into the decoder to get segmentation result.
Experimental results demonstrate that PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in parotid gland lesion segmentation across three independent
clinical centers, validating its clinical applicability and the effectiveness
of diagnostic text for enhancing image segmentation in real-world clinical
settings.

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative image guidance is critical for achieving maximal safe
resection in brain tumor surgery, yet neuronavigation systems based on
preoperative MRI lose accuracy during the procedure due to brain shift.
Aligning post-resection intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) with preoperative MRI
can restore spatial accuracy by estimating brain shift deformations, but it
remains a challenging problem given the large anatomical and topological
changes and substantial modality intensity gap. The ReMIND2Reg 2025 Challenge
provides the largest public benchmark for this task, built upon the ReMIND
dataset. It offers 99 training cases, 5 validation cases, and 10 private test
cases comprising paired 3D ceT1 MRI, T2 MRI, and post-resection 3D iUS volumes.
Data are provided without annotations for training, while validation and test
performance are evaluated on manually annotated anatomical landmarks. Metrics
include target registration error (TRE), robustness to worst-case landmark
misalignment (TRE30), and runtime. By establishing a standardized evaluation
framework for this clinically critical and technically complex problem,
ReMIND2Reg aims to accelerate the development of robust, generalizable, and
clinically deployable multimodal registration algorithms for image-guided
neurosurgery.

Motivation: 解决非视线（NLOS）成像中信号弱、易受噪声干扰的问题，提高重建精度和鲁棒性。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，尤其在快速扫描和稀疏照明点数据中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂场景下的NLOS成像提供了可行解决方案，兼具高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Computational imaging, especially non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, the
extraction of information from obscured or hidden scenes is achieved through
the utilization of indirect light signals resulting from multiple reflections
or scattering. The inherently weak nature of these signals, coupled with their
susceptibility to noise, necessitates the integration of physical processes to
ensure accurate reconstruction. This paper presents a parameterized inverse
problem framework tailored for large-scale linear problems in 3D imaging
reconstruction. Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively
assess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a
parameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping,
facilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction
framework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm
unfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also
enables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data,
thereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local
spatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed
information, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness.
Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real
datasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates
remarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point
data, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios.

TL;DR: NegFaceDiff是一种新的采样方法，通过在身份条件扩散过程中引入负条件，显著提高了生成数据的身份一致性和可分离性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有身份条件扩散模型在生成数据时缺乏明确的类间分离机制，导致身份重叠和FR性能不佳的问题。

Method: 提出NegFaceDiff方法，利用负条件在扩散过程中引导模型远离不需要的特征，同时保持类内一致性。

Result: 实验表明，NegFaceDiff将身份可分离性（FDR）从2.427提升到5.687，并在多个基准测试中优于无负条件生成的数据。

Conclusion: NegFaceDiff通过负条件显著提升了生成数据的质量，进而改善了FR系统的性能。

Abstract: The use of synthetic data as an alternative to authentic datasets in face
recognition (FR) development has gained significant attention, addressing
privacy, ethical, and practical concerns associated with collecting and using
authentic data. Recent state-of-the-art approaches have proposed
identity-conditioned diffusion models to generate identity-consistent face
images, facilitating their use in training FR models. However, these methods
often lack explicit sampling mechanisms to enforce inter-class separability,
leading to identity overlap in the generated data and, consequently, suboptimal
FR performance. In this work, we introduce NegFaceDiff, a novel sampling method
that incorporates negative conditions into the identity-conditioned diffusion
process. NegFaceDiff enhances identity separation by leveraging negative
conditions that explicitly guide the model away from unwanted features while
preserving intra-class consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NegFaceDiff significantly improves the identity consistency and separability of
data generated by identity-conditioned diffusion models. Specifically, identity
separability, measured by the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), increases from
2.427 to 5.687. These improvements are reflected in FR systems trained on the
NegFaceDiff dataset, which outperform models trained on data generated without
negative conditions across multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图重建3D场景时信息不足，导致明显伪影，现有生成先验方法难以保持与输入观察的一致性。

Method: 基于DiT的视频扩散模型，结合2D语义和3D几何特征，以参考视图修复伪影。

Result: GSFixer在3DGS伪影修复和稀疏视图3D重建中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GSFixer通过参考引导和多特征整合，显著提升了3DGS重建质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from sparse views
is an ill-posed problem due to insufficient information, often resulting in
noticeable artifacts. While recent approaches have sought to leverage
generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they
struggle to generate content that remains consistent with input observations.
To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to
improve the quality of 3DGS representations reconstructed from sparse inputs.
The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built
upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders
and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the
input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic
features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual
geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency
when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable
benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which
contains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS
artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Project page:

Conclusion: 该工作推动了面部表示学习，提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，减少了对昂贵标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Facial representation pre-training is crucial for tasks like facial
recognition, expression analysis, and virtual reality. However, existing
methods face three key challenges: (1) failing to capture distinct facial
features and fine-grained semantics, (2) ignoring the spatial structure
inherent to facial anatomy, and (3) inefficiently utilizing limited labeled
data. To overcome these, we introduce PaCo-FR, an unsupervised framework that
combines masked image modeling with patch-pixel alignment. Our approach
integrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that
preserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial
regions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination
with multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that
preserve geometric relationships between facial components. PaCo-FR achieves
state-of-the-art performance across several facial analysis tasks with just 2
million unlabeled images for pre-training. Our method demonstrates significant
improvements, particularly in scenarios with varying poses, occlusions, and
lighting conditions. We believe this work advances facial representation
learning and offers a scalable, efficient solution that reduces reliance on
expensive annotated datasets, driving more effective facial analysis systems.

Conclusion: SAFF通过槽注意力有效过滤无关特征，提升了小样本分类性能。

Abstract: Irrelevant features can significantly degrade few-shot learn ing performance.
This problem is used to match queries and support images based on meaningful
similarities despite the limited data. However, in this process, non-relevant
fea tures such as background elements can easily lead to confu sion and
misclassification. To address this issue, we pro pose Slot Attention-based
Feature Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SAFF) that leverages slot attention
mechanisms to discriminate and filter weak features, thereby improving few-shot
classification performance. The key innovation of SAFF lies in its integration
of slot attention with patch em beddings, unifying class-aware slots into a
single attention mechanism to filter irrelevant features effectively. We intro
duce a similarity matrix that computes across support and query images to
quantify the relevance of filtered embed dings for classification. Through
experiments, we demon strate that Slot Attention performs better than other
atten tion mechanisms, capturing discriminative features while reducing
irrelevant information. We validate our approach through extensive experiments
on few-shot learning bench marks: CIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet and tieredIma
geNet, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MangaDiT通过内部注意力机制隐式发现语义对应，提升了参考引导线稿上色的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved the
performance of reference-guided line art colorization. However, existing
methods still struggle with region-level color consistency, especially when the
reference and target images differ in character pose or motion. Instead of
relying on external matching annotations between the reference and target, we
propose to discover semantic correspondences implicitly through internal
attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for
reference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT).
Our model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and
introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention
weighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an
additional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features,
effectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level
color alignment. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: NEURAL通过创建任务无关的数据资产，解决了数据大小与临床效用之间的权衡，支持高效工作流程和远程放射学。

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal medical imaging data presents significant
storage and transmission challenges, particularly in resource-constrained
clinical settings. We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by
using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes
cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a
fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays,
preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the
image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based
representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived
from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies
downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for
pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size
while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming
other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent,
task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and
clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without
sacrificing performance. Our NEURAL code is available at

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates.
Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification
serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection.
However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for
comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches
combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms
for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular,
graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within
heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling
missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and
consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms
baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data
scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven computer vision have enabled robust autonomous

safety requirements for aviation applications remains a major challenge. In
this work, we present a practical vision-based pipeline for aircraft pose
estimation from runway images that represents a step toward the ability to
certify these systems for use in safety-critical aviation applications. Our
approach features three key innovations: (i) an efficient, flexible neural
architecture based on a spatial Soft Argmax operator for probabilistic keypoint
regression, supporting diverse vision backbones with real-time inference; (ii)
a principled loss function producing calibrated predictive uncertainties, which
are evaluated via sharpness and calibration metrics; and (iii) an adaptation of
Residual-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), enabling
runtime detection and rejection of faulty model outputs. We implement and
evaluate our pose estimation pipeline on a dataset of runway images. We show
that our model outperforms baseline architectures in terms of accuracy while
also producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with sub-pixel precision

Conclusion: M3-Agent在多模态代理的长期记忆和推理能力方面取得了显著进展，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with
long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and
auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic
memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world
knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal
format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.
Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative
reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the
task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal
agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.
M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's
perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse
scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test
key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,
general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results
show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the
strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o,
achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web
and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances the multimodal agents toward
more human-like long-term memory and provides insights into their practical
design. Model, code and data are available at

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）计算成本高，稀疏混合专家（MoE）架构虽能提升参数效率，但如何同时建模模态内特征和跨模态关联仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出MoIIE架构，通过模态引导的路由机制将令牌分配到模态内专家和共享的跨模态专家池，并采用两阶段训练策略激活MoE和多模态能力。

Conclusion: MoIIE架构有效平衡了计算效率和性能，为稀疏混合专家在多模态任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across multi-modal tasks by scaling model size and training data. However,
these dense LVLMs incur significant computational costs and motivate the
exploration of sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. While MoE improve
parameter efficiency, effectively applying MoE to simultaneously model
modality-specific features and cross-modal associations in LVLMs remains
challenging. In this work, we propose to incorporate Mixture of Intra- and
Inter-Modality Experts (MoIIE) to LVLMs. For each token, expert routing is
guided by its modality, directing tokens to their respective intra-modality
experts as well as a shared pool of inter-modality experts, enabling the model
to jointly learn rich intra-modal features and cross-modal interactions. We
further introduce an effective and straightforward two-stage training strategy,
which facilitates the direct activation of both MoE and multi-modal
capabilities. Extensive experiments across different data scales and LLM
backbone demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and generality of our
approach. Notably, our MoIIE models with 5.5B and 11.3B activated parameters
match or even surpass the performance of existing advanced open-source MoE-LLMs
based multi-modal models that involve more activated parameters. The code is

Motivation: 研究如何在少样本类增量学习（FSCIL）任务中利用大规模预训练模型的泛化能力，同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出DSS-Prompt，结合静态提示（适应预训练与下游任务间的领域差距）和动态提示（捕获实例感知语义），利用多模态模型生成输入相关的动态提示。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，DSS-Prompt表现优于现有方法，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: DSS-Prompt通过提示机制显著提升了FSCIL任务的性能，且无需增量任务上的额外训练。

Abstract: Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization
ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks
recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot
class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new
concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the
same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective
approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal
modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely,
we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each
Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the
pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and
dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy
transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we
leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse
semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then
adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top
of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat
state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our
DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than
existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic
forgetting issue as well.

*Yingjie Wang,Zhixing Wang,Le Zheng,Tianxiao Liu,Roujing Li,Xueyao Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeMoSORT是一种实时多目标跟踪方法，通过改进卡尔曼滤波和自适应IoU匹配，解决了复杂运动和遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖卡尔曼滤波和固定IoU匹配，无法适应复杂运动和遮挡，导致跟踪错误。

Method: 提出MeKF（记忆辅助卡尔曼滤波）和Mo-IoU（运动自适应IoU），分别优化运动模型和匹配策略。

Result: 在DanceTrack和SportsMOT数据集上，HOTA分数分别达到67.9%和82.1%。

Conclusion: MeMoSORT在复杂场景下表现优异，实现了实时高性能跟踪。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in human-dominant scenarios, which involves
continuously tracking multiple people within video sequences, remains a
significant challenge in computer vision due to targets' complex motion and
severe occlusions. Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally
limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over
Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches
real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association
struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To
address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT
tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter
(MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches
between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU
(Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height
similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association
failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT
show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of
67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUJICA是一种基于跨图注意力的多模态上采样方法，用于提升PBR材料的超分辨率重建效果，解决了现有SISR方法的跨图不一致性和模态特定特征建模不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SISR方法在PBR材料超分辨率任务中存在跨图不一致、模态特征建模不足和数据分布偏移导致的泛化能力有限问题。

Method: 提出MUJICA，一种灵活的适配器，基于预训练的Swin-transformer SISR模型，通过跨图注意力融合特征，提升PBR材料超分辨率效果。

Result: MUJICA在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上表现优异，同时保持了跨图一致性，并在有限资源下实现高效训练。

Conclusion: MUJICA在PBR材料超分辨率任务中实现了先进性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials are typically characterized by
multiple 2D texture maps such as basecolor, normal, metallic, and roughness
which encode spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution function
(SVBRDF) parameters to model surface reflectance properties and microfacet
interactions. Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics
applications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods
struggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific
features, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this
work, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention
(MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based
SISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached
after the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map
attention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability
of the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and
HMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map
consistency. Experiments demonstrate that MUJICA enables efficient training
even with limited resources and delivers state-of-the-art performance on PBR
material datasets.

Conclusion: 计算机视觉模型为动态反偷猎提供了高效、非侵入性的解决方案。

Abstract: Elephant Poaching in African countries has been a decade-old problem. So much
so that African Forest Elephants are now listed as an endangered species, and
African Savannah Elephants as critically endangered by the IUCN (International
Union for Conservation of Nature). [1] Elephants are hunted primarily for their
ivory tusks which caused many elephants to be born tuskless as a genetic
modification for survival. [2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that
though poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather
dynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several
other factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts
in poaching hotspot locations. [3] After a period of low poaching from
2000-2014, poaching numbers in African countries are now on the rise again --
WWF (World Wildlife Foundation) says there are 20,000 elephants poached
annually [4]. In African countries, anti-poaching efforts are concentrated near
towns, while a majority of poaching occurs in the deserted regions. All of
these factors result in the need for a Computer Vision Model to identify
poaching hotspots through locating the geographic indicators of favorable
poaching regions. A CV model eliminates the need to manually track poachers and
account for the environmental factors to deploy resources and its combination
with satellite imagery allows us to survey large areas without disturbing local
species or cross border aviation restrictions.

Motivation: 探究CLIP模型训练中与低层次人类感知相关性先升后降的现象及其原因。

Method: 通过分析形状-纹理偏差对齐和噪声下的分类准确性变化。

Result: CLIP初期学习低层次视觉特征，增强与人类感知对齐但增加噪声敏感性；后期转向抽象形状表示，提高鲁棒性但降低感知对齐。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了学习机制中的权衡，为优化视觉语言模型的感知对齐与鲁棒性提供了新见解。

Abstract: During the training of multi-modal models like CLIP, we observed an
intriguing phenomenon: the correlation with low-level human image quality
assessments peaks in the early epochs before gradually declining. This study
investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two
key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop
under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual
features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also
increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training
progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations,
improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human
perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying
learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off
between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.

Motivation: 现有模型仅关注运动数据或视频，无法全面捕捉人类行为的细微差别。

Method: 提出ViMoNet框架，采用联合训练策略，结合精确的运动-文本数据和通用的视频-文本数据。

Result: ViMoNet在标题生成、运动理解和行为解释方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViMoNet通过结合两种数据类型，显著提升了人类行为理解的性能。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can be used to
understand human behavior using motion and video data. We think that mixing
both types is essential to completely capture the nuanced movements and
meanings of human actions, in contrast to recent models that simply concentrate
on motion data or films. To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward
yet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human
action. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages
of two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic
video-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in
the model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human
behavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that
contains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We
developed ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled
samples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show
that ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion
understanding, and behavior interpretation.

Motivation: 机器人操作数据稀缺，促使研究者利用其他模态的预训练大模型。

Method: 提出PAR模型，结合帧和动作的物理令牌，采用DiT-based去令牌化器，并引入因果掩码、逆运动学、并行训练和KV-cache机制。

Result: 在ManiSkill基准测试中，PAR在PushCube任务上达到100%成功率，其他任务表现与动作预训练基线相当，且能准确预测未来视频。

Conclusion: PAR展示了通过视频预训练迁移世界知识在机器人操作中的潜力。

Abstract: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large
models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon
autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive
Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the
joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world
knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without
requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent
action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames
and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and
facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with
inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further
improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show
that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the
performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately
predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings
underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world
knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

<details>

Motivation: 传统转置卷积并非卷积的真正逆运算，缺乏标准反向卷积算子，限制了神经网络设计的灵活性。

Method: 通过正则化最小二乘优化问题设计深度反向卷积算子，结合层归一化、1×1卷积和GELU激活构建反向卷积块。

Result: ConverseNet在去噪、超分辨率和去模糊任务中表现优于传统卷积和转置卷积。

Conclusion: 深度反向卷积算子为深度模型设计提供了新思路，有望推动新算子的开发与应用。

Abstract: Convolution and transposed convolution are fundamental operators widely used
in neural networks. However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does
not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their
mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been
established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we
propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to
effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a
regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its
kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure
its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct
a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,
1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like
structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional
convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,
leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image
restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants
of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,
respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this
work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and
applications.

Motivation: 现有OIQA方法难以评估局部非均匀失真，因未能有效建模质量的空间变化和特征表示。

Method: 采用斐波那契球采样生成视口，构建图节点；结合GAT和图Transformer建模局部和全局空间依赖关系。

Result: 在两个大规模OIQA数据库上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Current Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment (OIQA) methods struggle to
evaluate locally non-uniform distortions due to inadequate modeling of spatial
variations in quality and ineffective feature representation capturing both
local details and global context. To address this, we propose a graph neural
network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships
between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity.
Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with
well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage
feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation.
To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent
viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions
across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases
with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong
generalization capability.

Stable Diffusion models as a separate experiment. Building on the
multi-conditioning approach of Giambi and Lisanti, which uses both attribute
vectors and segmentation masks, our main contribution is the integration of an
InfoNCE loss for attribute embedding and the adoption of a SegFormer-based
segmentation encoder. These enhancements improve the semantic alignment and
controllability of attribute-guided synthesis. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of contrastive embedding learning and advanced segmentation
encoding for controlled face generation in limited data settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线CT成像技术存在固有成像伪影（如束硬化和部分体积效应），使得微结构的定量分析需要用户基于灰度值做出多步决策，因此需要工具辅助。

Method: 开发ARI3D软件工具，通过交互式分析协议帮助用户在3D图像中分类和量化对象。

Result: ARI3D能够改进相位识别、处理部分体积效应、提高检测限和量化准确性，并支持跨学科应用。

Conclusion: ARI3D为X射线CT图像的定量分析提供了高效工具，解决了现有技术中的挑战，并具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the main 3D technique for imaging the
internal microstructures of materials. Quantitative analysis of the
microstructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are
implemented to the entire 3D image. This is challenged by various imaging
artifacts inherent from the technique, e.g., beam hardening and partial volume.
Consequently, the analysis requires users to make a number of decisions to
segment and classify the microstructures based on the voxel gray-values. In
this context, a software tool, here called ARI3D, is proposed to interactively
analyze regions in three-dimensional X-ray CT images, assisting users through
the various steps of a protocol designed to classify and quantify objects
within regions of a three-dimensional image. ARI3D aims to 1) Improve phase
identification; 2) Account for partial volume effect; 3) Increase the detection
limit and accuracy of object quantification; and 4) Harmonize quantitative 3D
analysis that can be implemented in different fields of science.

Result: 大模型对齐度更低，数据增强和正则化显著降低对齐度，数据集多样性影响较小，重复训练会进一步降低对齐度。

Conclusion: 模型复杂性、训练策略与人类感知对齐之间存在权衡，需在应用中权衡性能与对齐需求。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve remarkable performance in image
recognition tasks, yet their alignment with human perception remains largely
unexplored. This study systematically analyzes how model size, dataset size,
data augmentation and regularization impact ViT perceptual alignment with human
judgments on the TID2013 dataset. Our findings confirm that larger models
exhibit lower perceptual alignment, consistent with previous works. Increasing
dataset diversity has a minimal impact, but exposing models to the same images
more times reduces alignment. Stronger data augmentation and regularization
further decrease alignment, especially in models exposed to repeated training
cycles. These results highlight a trade-off between model complexity, training
strategies, and alignment with human perception, raising important
considerations for applications requiring human-like visual understanding.

Motivation: 离散视频VAE存在训练不稳定、时间长和重建质量差的问题，而连续VAE训练更易且性能更优，因此希望通过结合两者优势提升离散VAE的性能。

Method: 利用FSQ保留连续VAE先验，提出多令牌量化机制和首帧重建优化，并设计联合离散-连续优化方案。

Result: 训练速度提升数倍，PSNR提高近1 dB，4x16x16离散VAE性能显著改善，首次在单一网络中实现离散和连续表示的竞争性能。

Conclusion: OneVAE成功结合离散和连续VAE的优势，显著提升了离散视频VAE的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Encoding videos into discrete tokens could align with text tokens to
facilitate concise and unified multi-modal LLMs, yet introducing significant
spatiotemporal compression compared to continuous video representation.
Previous discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time,
and degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior
performance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video
VAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between
discrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively
preserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization
methods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster
than training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.
Meanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how
continuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we
introduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB
improvement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,
to tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we
strengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this
information in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x
16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous
optimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time,
achieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete
representations within a single network. We name our method OneVAE to reflect
this connection.

Conclusion: HumanGenesis通过协作代理解决了现有挑战，为合成人类动态提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: \textbf{Synthetic human dynamics} aims to generate photorealistic videos of
human subjects performing expressive, intention-driven motions. However,
current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency}
and \emph{coarse reconstruction}, due to limited 3D modeling and detail
preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene
inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these,
we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and
generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1)
\textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from
monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2)
\textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and
refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose
Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences
using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes
photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion,
refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis
achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis,
video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving
expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

Result: E-4DGS在合成多视角事件流数据集上表现优于纯事件和事件-RGB融合基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角事件流重建提供了一种新思路，推动了快速场景捕捉技术的发展。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis and 4D reconstruction techniques predominantly rely on
RGB cameras, thereby inheriting inherent limitations such as the dependence on
adequate lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and a limited dynamic range.
Event cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and
high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene
reconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this
end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting
approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with
fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization
scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting
for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance
pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while
incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We
design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras
surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark
multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our
approach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves
the way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel
approach for rapid scene capture.

Abstract: Detection of face forgery videos remains a formidable challenge in the field
of digital forensics, especially the generalization to unseen datasets and
common perturbations. In this paper, we tackle this issue by leveraging the
synergy between audio and visual speech elements, embarking on a novel approach
through audio-visual speech representation learning. Our work is motivated by
the finding that audio signals, enriched with speech content, can provide
precise information effectively reflecting facial movements. To this end, we
first learn precise audio-visual speech representations on real videos via a
self-supervised masked prediction task, which encodes both local and global
semantic information simultaneously. Then, the derived model is directly
transferred to the forgery detection task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
cross-dataset generalization and robustness, without the participation of any
fake video in model training. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在罕见细胞类型和跨域泛化上表现不佳，限制了肿瘤微环境分析的全面性。

Method: 基于108,722个细胞核的新数据集训练HistoPLUS模型，涵盖13种细胞类型。

Result: 在外部验证中，HistoPLUS在检测质量和分类F1分数上分别提升5.2%和23.7%，且参数减少5倍。

Conclusion: HistoPLUS显著提升了罕见细胞类型的研究能力，并支持跨域应用，推动了TME生物标志物研究。

Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing
tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. Existing
methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not
present in public datasets) and limited cross-domain generalization. To address
these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell
analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei
covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts,
HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by
5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer
parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types
and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show
that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during
training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model
weights and inference code at https://github.com/owkin/histoplus/.

Method: 系统比较三种最先进的HTG模型（生成对抗、扩散和自回归范式），分析合成数据的视觉和语言特征对HTR微调的影响。

Result: 评估了HTG模型对HTR性能的提升效果，并提出了选择最优模型的定量指南。

Conclusion: HTG方法在低资源HTR中具有潜力，但仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: The digitization of historical manuscripts presents significant challenges
for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems, particularly when dealing with
small, author-specific collections that diverge from the training data
distributions. Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) techniques, which generate
synthetic data tailored to specific handwriting styles, offer a promising
solution to address these challenges. However, the effectiveness of various HTG
models in enhancing HTR performance, especially in low-resource transcription
settings, has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we systematically
compare three state-of-the-art styled HTG models (representing the generative
adversarial, diffusion, and autoregressive paradigms for HTG) to assess their
impact on HTR fine-tuning. We analyze how visual and linguistic characteristics
of synthetic data influence fine-tuning outcomes and provide quantitative
guidelines for selecting the most effective HTG model. The results of our
analysis provide insights into the current capabilities of HTG methods and
highlight key areas for further improvement in their application to
low-resource HTR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AST-n框架通过从中间噪声水平启动反向扩散并结合高阶ODE求解器，显著加速低剂量CT去噪，仅需25步即可达到高质量结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）虽减少辐射但增加图像噪声，影响诊断信心。扩散生成模型在LDCT去噪中表现潜力，但传统方法计算成本高。

Method: 提出AST-n框架，结合中间噪声启动和高阶ODE求解器，减少采样步骤。评估AST-n采样与标准调度两种加速范式。

Result: AST-25在25步内实现PSNR>38 dB和SSIM>0.95，接近基线质量，推理时间从16秒降至1秒。无条件采样质量显著下降。

Conclusion: AST-n结合高阶求解器可在不显著损失图像质量下快速重建LDCT，推进扩散模型在临床中的应用。

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation exposure but increase image
noise, compromising diagnostic confidence. Diffusion-based generative models
have shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing
iterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated
inference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise
levels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to
further reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n
sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT
Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 %
of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM)
above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time
from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers
substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also
assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling
inference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate
that AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without
significant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of
diffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用现成的Stable Diffusion模型进行视觉上下文学习（V-ICL）的方法，无需额外微调即可适应多种视觉任务，并在多个任务上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用现成的Stable Diffusion模型实现视觉上下文学习，避免复杂的训练和额外数据需求，提高方法的通用性和简便性。

Method: 在Stable Diffusion的自注意力层中引入上下文重计算机制，显式结合查询和示例提示的上下文信息。

Result: 该方法在六个视觉任务上表现优异，例如在Pascal-5i数据集上，前景分割任务的mIoU分别比Visual Prompting和IMProv提高了8.9%和3.2%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，现成的Stable Diffusion模型可以通过简单的调整实现高效的视觉上下文学习，且能够通过集成多个提示进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) in natural language processing (NLP) have
demonstrated great potential for in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to
leverage a few sets of example prompts to adapt to various tasks without having
to explicitly update the model weights. ICL has recently been explored for
computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve
specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and
limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable
Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL).
Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the
self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly
incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any
additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is
able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object
detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and
colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection
over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by
8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv,
respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to
effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task
better and further improve the performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在面部动态转移中缺乏可解释性和细粒度控制的问题。

Method: 采用自编码器模型，通过稀疏运动字典将面部动态分解为可解释因素，支持“编辑-变形-渲染”策略。

Result: 在自重现和跨重现任务中表现优异，支持细粒度的用户引导编辑和3D感知操作。

Conclusion: LIA-X通过可解释性和可控性，为肖像动画和编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce LIA-X, a novel interpretable portrait animator designed to
transfer facial dynamics from a driving video to a source portrait with
fine-grained control. LIA-X is an autoencoder that models motion transfer as a
linear navigation of motion codes in latent space. Crucially, it incorporates a
novel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial
dynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render'
approaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X
to support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise
manipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This
helps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and
expression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully
training a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on
extensive datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method
outperforms previous approaches in both self-reenactment and cross-reenactment
tasks across several benchmarks. Additionally, the interpretable and
controllable nature of LIA-X supports practical applications such as
fine-grained, user-guided image and video editing, as well as 3D-aware portrait
video manipulation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC)的新方法，通过元学习和多样化分类器库提升少样本学习下的WSI分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言基础模型(VLFMs)的少样本学习方法在数据稀缺时表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: MOC包含元学习器和多样化分类器库，自动优化分类器配置。

Result: 在多个少样本基准测试中表现优异，TCGA-NSCLC基准上AUC提升10.4%。

Conclusion: MOC为临床数据稀缺场景提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in histopathology vision-language foundation models (VLFMs)
have shown promise in addressing data scarcity for whole slide image (WSI)
classification via zero-shot adaptation. However, these methods remain
outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches
trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI
classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot
methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on
conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data
scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC)
comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes
a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a
classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic
pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC
outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the
TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art
few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions,
offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic
training data is severely limited. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有3D方法需要大量姿态丰富视频，扩散方法难以保持身份一致性，PERSONA结合两者优势。

Method: 利用扩散方法生成姿态丰富视频，优化3D化身，引入平衡采样和几何加权优化。

Result: 实现从单张图像生成高质量、身份一致的3D化身，支持多样姿态。

Conclusion: PERSONA有效结合两种方法，解决了身份保持和姿态驱动的挑战。

Abstract: Two major approaches exist for creating animatable human avatars. The first,
a 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a
single person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity
representation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid
cloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and
impractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach,
learns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but
struggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement.
We present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches
to obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a
single image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate
pose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them.
To ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we
introduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced
sampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in
diffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes
geometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse
poses.

Result: 发现空间和时间冗余需不同策略，令牌压缩在多轮对话中表现不佳，联合压缩效果显著。

Conclusion: LLMC+为高效VLM研究提供了公平评估和未来方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive multi-modal
capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory demands, due
to their long visual token sequences and massive parameter sizes. To address
these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods.
However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1)
Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules,
hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2)
Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance
in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques,
without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce
LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile,
plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five
representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and
model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal
redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods
degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3)
Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal
performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire
future research in efficient VLM. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Story2Board通过轻量级框架实现了高质量的故事板生成，无需架构修改或微调。

Abstract: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard
generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject
identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial
composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we
introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:
Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across
panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual
features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these
mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,
enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet
consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf
language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.
To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain
narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded
storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene
Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.
Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that
Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging
storyboards than existing baselines.

TL;DR: DQInit是一种将值函数初始化（VFI）扩展到深度强化学习（DRL）的方法，通过重用先前任务的紧凑表格Q值作为可转移知识库，提升早期学习效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在DRL中扩展VFI面临状态-动作空间的连续性、神经网络噪声近似以及存储所有过去模型的不可行性等挑战。

Method: DQInit通过基于已知度的机制将转移值软集成到未探索区域，并逐步转向代理的学习估计，避免了固定时间衰减的限制。

Result: 实验表明，DQInit在多个连续控制任务中显著提升了早期学习效率、稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: DQInit为DRL中的知识转移提供了新视角，仅依赖值估计而非策略或演示，有效结合了跳启RL和策略蒸馏的优点。

Abstract: Value function initialization (VFI) is an effective way to achieve a
jumpstart in reinforcement learning (RL) by leveraging value estimates from
prior tasks. While this approach is well established in tabular settings,
extending it to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) poses challenges due to the
continuous nature of the state-action space, the noisy approximations of neural
networks, and the impracticality of storing all past models for reuse. In this
work, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts
value function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values
extracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It
employs a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred
values into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's
learned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay. Our approach
offers a novel perspective on knowledge transfer in DRL by relying solely on
value estimates rather than policies or demonstrations, effectively combining
the strengths of jumpstart RL and policy distillation while mitigating their
drawbacks. Experiments across multiple continuous control tasks demonstrate
that DQInit consistently improves early learning efficiency, stability, and
overall performance compared to standard initialization and existing transfer
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI评测主要关注固定环境下的性能优化，忽视了系统面对规则或结构变化时的适应能力，这是实现人工通用智能（AGI）的关键。

Method: 通过Othello AI Arena，参与者需在60秒内分析新Othello棋盘的配置和规则，并生成针对性策略，平台提供多样化游戏阶段和实时评估。

Result: 初步测试显示，参与者采用了从快速参数调整到通过模拟学习环境模型等多种适应方法。

Conclusion: Othello AI Arena不仅是一个研究基准，也是培养和评估AI系统快速智能适应能力的教育工具。

Abstract: The ability to rapidly adapt to novel and unforeseen environmental changes is
a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence (AGI), yet it remains a
critical blind spot in most existing AI benchmarks. Traditional evaluation
largely focuses on optimizing performance within fixed environments, failing to
assess systems' flexibility and generalization capabilities when faced with
even subtle rule or structural modifications. Addressing this gap, I introduce
the Othello AI Arena, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate
intelligent systems based on their capacity for limited-time adaptation to
unseen environments. Our platform poses a meta-learning challenge: participants
must develop systems that can analyze the specific configuration and rules of a
novel Othello board within a strict time limit (60 seconds) and generate a
tailored, high-performing strategy for that unique environment. With this,
evaluation of the meta-level intelligence can be separated from the task-level
strategy performance. The Arena features a diverse set of game stages,
including public stages for development and private stages with structural and
rule variations designed to test genuine adaptive and generalization
capabilities. Implemented as an accessible web-based platform, the Arena
provides real-time visualization, automated evaluation using multi-dimensional
metrics, and comprehensive logging for post-hoc analysis. Initial observations
from pilot tests and preliminary student engagements highlight fascinating
patterns in adaptation approaches, ranging from rapid parameter tuning to
rudimentary environmental model learning through simulation. The Othello AI
Arena offers a unique educational tool and a valuable research benchmark for
fostering and evaluating the crucial skill of rapid, intelligent adaptation in
AI systems.

multi-modal AI assistants have become essential interfaces for daily user
interactions. However, current evaluation methods face challenges including
high manual costs, inconsistent standards, and subjective bias. This paper
proposes an automated multi-modal evaluation framework based on large language
models and multi-agent collaboration. The framework employs a three-tier agent
architecture consisting of interaction evaluation agents, semantic verification
agents, and experience decision agents. Through supervised fine-tuning on the
Qwen3-8B model, we achieve a significant evaluation matching accuracy with
human experts. Experimental results on eight major intelligent agents
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in predicting users' satisfaction and
identifying generation defects.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EvoCurr的自进化框架，通过动态调整问题难度来提升大语言模型在复杂决策任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂问题中表现不佳，缺乏结构化中间指导导致效率低下或失败。

Method: 使用专门的课程生成LLM构建逐步增加难度的问题序列，动态调整以适应求解LLM的学习进度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了任务成功率和解决效率。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的课程学习在增强复杂领域自动推理方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, including programming, planning, and decision-making. However,
their performance often degrades when faced with highly complex problem
instances that require deep reasoning over long horizons. In such cases, direct
problem-solving approaches can lead to inefficiency or failure due to the lack
of structured intermediate guidance. To address this, we propose a novel
self-evolve framework, EvoCurr, in which a dedicated curriculum-generation LLM
constructs a sequence of problem instances with gradually increasing
difficulty, tailored to the solver LLM's learning progress. The curriculum
dynamically adapts easing challenges when the solver struggles and escalating
them when success is consistent, thus maintaining an optimal learning
trajectory. This approach enables the solver LLM, implemented as a
code-generation model producing Python decision-tree scripts, to progressively
acquire the skills needed for complex decision-making tasks. Experimental
results on challenging decision-making benchmarks show that our method
significantly improves task success rates and solution efficiency compared to
direct-solving baselines. These findings suggest that LLM-driven curriculum
learning holds strong potential for enhancing automated reasoning in
real-world, high-complexity domains.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种方法，将SHAP值中的不确定性分解为偶然性、认知性和纠缠性成分，结合Dempster-Shafer证据理论和Dirichlet过程采样，验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP值通常被视为点估计，忽略了预测模型和数据中的不确定性，这在高风险领域（如医疗分析）中尤为重要。

Method: 结合Dempster-Shafer证据理论和Dirichlet过程采样，分解SHAP值中的不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，SHAP值最高的特征不一定最稳定，认知性不确定性可通过更好的数据和模型开发技术减少。

Conclusion: 该方法为SHAP解释的可靠性和可解释性提供了更全面的理解，有助于高风险应用中的决策和模型优化。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP), have become essential tools for interpreting
complex ensemble tree-based models, especially in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare analytics. However, SHAP values are usually treated as point
estimates, which disregards the inherent and ubiquitous uncertainty in
predictive models and data. This uncertainty has two primary sources: aleatoric
and epistemic. The aleatoric uncertainty, which reflects the irreducible noise
in the data. The epistemic uncertainty, which arises from a lack of data. In
this work, we propose an approach for decomposing uncertainty in SHAP values
into aleatoric, epistemic, and entanglement components. This approach
integrates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and hypothesis sampling via
Dirichlet processes over tree ensembles. We validate the method across three
real-world use cases with descriptive statistical analyses that provide insight
into the nature of epistemic uncertainty embedded in SHAP explanations. The
experimentations enable to provide more comprehensive understanding of the
reliability and interpretability of SHAP-based attributions. This understanding
can guide the development of robust decision-making processes and the
refinement of models in high-stakes applications. Through our experiments with
multiple datasets, we concluded that features with the highest SHAP values are
not necessarily the most stable. This epistemic uncertainty can be reduced
through better, more representative data and following appropriate or
case-desired model development techniques. Tree-based models, especially
bagging, facilitate the effective quantification of epistemic uncertainty.

TL;DR: MEML-GRPO通过多专家互学机制和多样化提示解决RLVR中的奖励稀疏问题，显著提升LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR方法在奖励稀疏时无法提供有效学习信号，尤其在复杂任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出MEML-GRPO框架，利用多样化专家提示生成更多响应，并通过专家间互学机制促进知识共享。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，MEML-GRPO平均性能提升4.89%（Qwen）和11.33%（Llama）。

Conclusion: MEML-GRPO有效克服传统RLVR的核心限制，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR faces challenges with reward
sparsity, where zero rewards from consistently incorrect candidate answers
provide no learning signal, particularly in challenging tasks. To address this,
we propose Multi-Expert Mutual Learning GRPO (MEML-GRPO), an innovative
framework that utilizes diverse expert prompts as system prompts to generate a
broader range of responses, substantially increasing the likelihood of
identifying correct solutions. Additionally, we introduce an inter-expert
mutual learning mechanism that facilitates knowledge sharing and transfer among
experts, further boosting the model's performance through RLVR. Extensive
experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that MEML-GRPO delivers
significant improvements, achieving an average performance gain of 4.89% with
Qwen and 11.33% with Llama, effectively overcoming the core limitations of
traditional RLVR methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督去偏对齐框架（UDA），通过动态调整Elo评分系统减少评估中的偏好偏差，提升模型排名的稳定性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLM）成对评估存在偏好偏差，导致不同评委的排名不一致且偏斜。

Method: 提出UDA框架，通过紧凑神经网络动态调整Elo评分系统的K因子和胜率，以最小化评委间评分轨迹的分散为目标，无监督地实现评委共识对齐。

Result: 实验显示，UDA将评委间评分标准差降低63.4%，与人类判断的平均相关性提升24.7%，并显著提升低质量评委的表现。

Conclusion: UDA通过无监督共识对齐有效减少系统偏差，为LLM评估提供了更稳健可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Pairwise evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a common paradigm, but
it is prone to preference bias, where judges systematically favor certain
outputs, such as their own. This bias leads to inconsistent and skewed rankings
across different judges. To address this, we first empirically demonstrate
significant and heterogeneous biases in cross-model evaluations. We then
propose UDA (Unsupervised Debiasing Alignment), a framework that reduces
inter-judge disagreement by dynamically adjusting the Elo rating system. For
each pairwise comparison, a compact neural network learns to adaptively set the
K-factor and refine win probabilities. Crucially, UDA operates in a fully
unsupervised manner, guided solely by the objective of minimizing the
dispersion among the Elo trajectories of all judges. This forces an alignment
towards a collective consensus, which serves as an unsupervised proxy for a
more stable and reproducible evaluation. In addition, we provide theoretical
motivation demonstrating how alignment towards a consensus can reduce aggregate
system bias. Experiments show that UDA significantly reduces the inter-judge
rating standard deviation by up to 63.4% and improves the average correlation
with human judgments by 24.7%. Notably, UDA elevates the performance of poorly
performing judges to achieve parity with high-quality ones, fostering a more
robust and reliable evaluation ecosystem. Code and data are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了PacifAIst基准，用于评估大语言模型在目标冲突情境下的行为对齐，发现不同模型表现差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型自主性增强，现有安全基准未能系统评估其目标冲突下的决策行为，亟需新工具填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了包含700个挑战性场景的PacifAIst基准，基于Existential Prioritization分类测试模型行为。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Flash表现最佳（P-Score 90.31%），GPT-5最低（79.49%），模型在子类别中表现差异显著。

Conclusion: PacifAIst为评估和缓解目标冲突风险提供了标准化工具，确保AI行为优先符合人类安全。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly autonomous and integrated
into critical societal functions, the focus of AI safety must evolve from
mitigating harmful content to evaluating underlying behavioral alignment.
Current safety benchmarks do not systematically probe a model's decision-making
in scenarios where its own instrumental goals - such as self-preservation,
resource acquisition, or goal completion - conflict with human safety. This
represents a critical gap in our ability to measure and mitigate risks
associated with emergent, misaligned behaviors. To address this, we introduce
PacifAIst (Procedural Assessment of Complex Interactions for Foundational
Artificial Intelligence Scenario Testing), a focused benchmark of 700
challenging scenarios designed to quantify self-preferential behavior in LLMs.
The benchmark is structured around a novel taxonomy of Existential
Prioritization (EP), with subcategories testing Self-Preservation vs. Human
Safety (EP1), Resource Conflict (EP2), and Goal Preservation vs. Evasion (EP3).
We evaluated eight leading LLMs. The results reveal a significant performance
hierarchy. Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the highest Pacifism Score
(P-Score) at 90.31%, demonstrating strong human-centric alignment. In a
surprising result, the much-anticipated GPT-5 recorded the lowest P-Score
(79.49%), indicating potential alignment challenges. Performance varied
significantly across subcategories, with models like Claude Sonnet 4 and
Mistral Medium struggling notably in direct self-preservation dilemmas. These
findings underscore the urgent need for standardized tools like PacifAIst to
measure and mitigate risks from instrumental goal conflicts, ensuring future AI
systems are not only helpful in conversation but also provably "pacifist" in
their behavioral priorities.

Motivation: 在多智能体系统中，基于观察的知识变化是认知规划的关键，POL为此提供了一种逻辑框架。

Method: 通过扩展克里普克模型，每个状态配备一组预期观察，状态随观察匹配而演化。

Result: 证明了POL的可满足性问题是2EXPTIME完全的。

Conclusion: POL为基于观察的知识更新提供了有效的逻辑工具，但其复杂性较高。

Abstract: Logics for reasoning about knowledge and actions have seen many applications
in various domains of multi-agent systems, including epistemic planning. Change
of knowledge based on observations about the surroundings forms a key aspect in
such planning scenarios. Public Observation Logic (POL) is a variant of public
announcement logic for reasoning about knowledge that gets updated based on
public observations. Each state in an epistemic (Kripke) model is equipped with
a set of expected observations. These states evolve as the expectations get
matched with the actual observations. In this work, we prove that the
satisfiability problem of $\POL$ is 2EXPTIME-complete.

Conclusion: VIPCGRL为人类对齐AI提供了新方法，提升了协作内容生成中的人类相似性和可控性。

Abstract: Human-aligned AI is a critical component of co-creativity, as it enables
models to accurately interpret human intent and generate controllable outputs
that align with design goals in collaborative content creation. This direction
is especially relevant in procedural content generation via reinforcement
learning (PCGRL), which is intended to serve as a tool for human designers.
However, existing systems often fall short of exhibiting human-centered
behavior, limiting the practical utility of AI-driven generation tools in
real-world design workflows. In this paper, we propose VIPCGRL
(Vision-Instruction PCGRL), a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that
incorporates three modalities-text, level, and sketches-to extend control
modality and enhance human-likeness. We introduce a shared embedding space
trained via quadruple contrastive learning across modalities and human-AI
styles, and align the policy using an auxiliary reward based on embedding
similarity. Experimental results show that VIPCGRL outperforms existing
baselines in human-likeness, as validated by both quantitative metrics and
human evaluations. The code and dataset will be available upon publication.

Result: 在GAIA测试数据集上，动态操控机制显著提升了解决方案的有效性和稳定性，优于单代理系统和标准工具增强系统。

Conclusion: 动态MAS系统在GAIA排行榜上名列前茅，证明了协作代理角色在构建可靠智能系统中的实用价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has empowered
intelligent agents to leverage diverse external tools for solving complex
real-world problems. However, as agents increasingly depend on multiple tools,
they encounter new challenges: extended contexts from disparate sources and
noisy or irrelevant tool outputs can undermine system reliability and accuracy.
These challenges underscore the necessity for enhanced stability in agent-based
systems. To address this, we introduce dynamic supervision and maneuvering
mechanisms, constructing a robust and dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS)
architecture within the AWorld framework. In our approach, the Execution Agent
invokes the Guard Agent at critical steps to verify and correct the reasoning
process, effectively reducing errors arising from noise and bolstering
problem-solving robustness. Extensive experiments on the GAIA test dataset
reveal that our dynamic maneuvering mechanism significantly improves both the
effectiveness and stability of solutions, outperforming single-agent system
(SAS) and standard tool-augmented systems. As a result, our dynamic MAS system
achieved first place among open-source projects on the prestigious GAIA
leaderboard. These findings highlight the practical value of collaborative
agent roles in developing more reliable and trustworthy intelligent systems.

Result: 混合系统在复杂监管查询中优于传统方法，确保事实正确性、可追溯性，并通过子图可视化增强理解。

Conclusion: 该框架为合规驱动和审计应用提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Regulatory compliance question answering (QA) requires precise, verifiable
information, and domain-specific expertise, posing challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we present a novel multi-agent framework
that integrates a Knowledge Graph (KG) of Regulatory triplets with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to address these demands. First, agents
build and maintain an ontology-free KG by extracting subject--predicate--object
(SPO) triplets from regulatory documents and systematically cleaning,
normalizing, deduplicating, and updating them. Second, these triplets are
embedded and stored along with their corresponding textual sections and
metadata in a single enriched vector database, allowing for both graph-based
reasoning and efficient information retrieval. Third, an orchestrated agent
pipeline leverages triplet-level retrieval for question answering, ensuring
high semantic alignment between user queries and the factual
"who-did-what-to-whom" core captured by the graph. Our hybrid system
outperforms conventional methods in complex regulatory queries, ensuring
factual correctness with embedded triplets, enabling traceability through a
unified vector database, and enhancing understanding through subgraph
visualization, providing a robust foundation for compliance-driven and broader
audit-focused applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在数学教育中的可靠性，为AI驱动的教学和评估提供改进策略。

Method: 通过构建挑战性数学任务，分析四种LLM的答案准确性和步骤错误，测试单代理和双代理配置。

Result: OpenAI o1模型表现最优，双代理配置显著提升性能，程序性错误最常见。

Conclusion: 研究为提升LLM性能和数学教育中的AI应用提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in AI-driven
educational instruction and assessment, particularly within mathematics
education. The capability of LLMs to generate accurate answers and detailed
solutions for math problem-solving tasks is foundational for ensuring reliable
and precise feedback and assessment in math education practices. Our study
focuses on evaluating the accuracy of four LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o and o1,
DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1) solving three categories of math tasks, including
arithmetic, algebra, and number theory, and identifies step-level reasoning
errors within their solutions. Instead of relying on standard benchmarks, we
intentionally build math tasks (via item models) that are challenging for LLMs
and prone to errors. The accuracy of final answers and the presence of errors
in individual solution steps were systematically analyzed and coded. Both
single-agent and dual-agent configurations were tested. It is observed that the
reasoning-enhanced OpenAI o1 model consistently achieved higher or nearly
perfect accuracy across all three math task categories. Analysis of errors
revealed that procedural slips were the most frequent and significantly
impacted overall performance, while conceptual misunderstandings were less
frequent. Deploying dual-agent configurations substantially improved overall
performance. These findings offer actionable insights into enhancing LLM
performance and underscore effective strategies for integrating LLMs into
mathematics education, thereby advancing AI-driven instructional practices and
assessment precision.
