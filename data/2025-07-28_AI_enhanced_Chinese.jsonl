This paper explores the\nintegration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large\nReasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs\naddress the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while\nLAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However,\neach paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action\ncapabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an\nintegrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for\nadvancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service\nrequirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus\nbridging the gap between intention and execution.

Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the\nhippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes\nepisodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for\nreasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with\nRules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves\nsystematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting\nmodules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive\nneocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural\nDecomposer, paralleling neocortical \"System 1\" computation, is trained on a\ntask-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one\ndecomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the\nsequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC\n\"System 2\" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas,\nstoring variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By\nexplicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed\nschematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations\nthrough explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on\nfrozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates\nsystematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99%\naccuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer\nmodule.

Owing to limited computational resources, operational\nmedium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models,\nwhich are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations,\nthe proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based\npost-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble\nmember, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution\nmodel outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of\nthe CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of\nCNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For\ncomparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with\nthe CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN\ncorrection before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy\nthan the reverse approach.

In parallel, the field of human parsing\nfocuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This\nwork aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic\nsegmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground\ntruth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are\nfirst aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the\nresulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to\nproduce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations.

However, the traditional centralized\nlearning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and\ntrained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized\napproaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing\nmodel training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these\nmethods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data\nand suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the\naggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of\nclinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously\nlearning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and\ndecentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system\nexpansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To\naddress these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning\nframework.

In practice, when humans attempt to\npredict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory\non a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,\nthe vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason\nover maps \\textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent\ndevelopment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong\ncapabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a\nnew possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an\nimage and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to\nperform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we\nfirst propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which\nevaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based\nreasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters.

In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep\nlearning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape\ndirectly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating\nbiophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with\nphysiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and\nfiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts\na graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to\nenable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial\nself-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training\ndatasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV\ngeometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter\naccuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing\ninference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and\nsignificantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation\nstudies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the\ncycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as\nfew as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate\nsurrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in\nthe future.", "AI": {"tldr": "HeartUnloadNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8212\u5f20\u672b\u671f\u7f51\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc3\u810f\u65e0\u8d1f\u8f7d\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5fc3\u810f\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u5bf9\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u572820,700\u4e2a\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6a21\u62df\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u4e9a\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb10^5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "HeartUnloadNet\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Videos and images\ngenerated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more\ndifficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new\nmodels to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted\nto solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly\ninteracts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using\nsolely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of\nboth deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an\napproach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on\nidentifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image\nprocessing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction\ntechnique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial\nlandmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance\nmetrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings\ndiscussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models\nwith accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering\naround 78%.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\nimagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet\nthe lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its\nsemantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and\nhigh-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To\nconstruct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which\ngenerates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive\ntransfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT\ndataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:\nimage-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).\nSpecifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:\nSAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable\nimprovements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and\n10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively.

To address this, we propose a novel\nmulti-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view\nsticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,\ninspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple\nviews, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by\nproviding rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a\nhierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual\nunderstanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both\nglobal and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive\nlearning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different\nstages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and\nlocal-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce\na text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall\nmultimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding.

However, since floorplans\nare minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric\ndifferences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this\ntask. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose\nfilters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization\nerrors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously\nshaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the\nview-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color\ncorrespondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB\nframes of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are\nrequired.

In particular, for certain\nspecialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently\npopulated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of\nlimited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets\ncompared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To\ntackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely\nSyn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the\nmodel performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic\ncamouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be\nutilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework\n(CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA\npropagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled\ntarget domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization.\nConsidering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of\npseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an\nevolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain.

In this paper, we introduce\nHQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a\nnovel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing\nthese limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)\nleveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based\ncandidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved\nobject boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that\nselectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby\noptimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and\n(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex\ntopological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video.

Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the\npoint set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution\nthat is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with\nnovel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the\nsource and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input\npoint clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from\nsurface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.\nThe results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and\nsemantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing\ntasks where structured point distributions are desired.

This signal is further\ncalibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which\ninherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with\nautoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.\nExperiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%\nhigher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while\nrequiring only 1% of the computational time.", "AI": {"tldr": "AEDR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6eaf\u6e90\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u635f\u5931\u6bd4\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb100\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u6210\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAEDR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u91cd\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u635f\u5931\u6bd4\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5747\u5300\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cAEDR\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad825.5%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u97001%\u3002", "conclusion": "AEDR\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6eaf\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point\ncloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,\ndue to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,\nthese methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the\nconflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the\nensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above\nchallenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates\npoint cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust\nanalysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a\nRectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted\nrectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving\nintricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we\nfurther incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts\nbased on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and\nadaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently\nunify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point\ncloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete\npoint cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, noise, often introduced by imaging devices, can degrade image\nquality, leading to misinterpretation and compromised clinical outcomes.\nExisting denoising approaches typically rely either on noise characteristics or\non contextual information from the image. Moreover, they are commonly developed\nand evaluated for a single imaging modality and noise type. Motivated by Geng\net.al CNCL, which integrates both noise and context, this study introduces a\nDual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model architecture that effectively denoises\nmedical images by leveraging both sources of information and fusing them to\ngenerate the final output. DPL is evaluated across multiple imaging modalities\nand various types of noise, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.\nDPL improves PSNR by 3.35% compared to the baseline UNet when evaluated on\nGaussian noise and trained across all modalities.

To address these challenges, in this paper a\nmodified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified\nFlow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation\nmethod are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling\nin medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing\nfeature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID\ndistributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic\nthe output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side\nteacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID\nmedical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform\nmulti-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,\nand exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%.

Specifically, many\nreal-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or\nnon-existent, \\eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific\nconditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale\ntraining, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.\nTo address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the\nscarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive\ndata containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions\ndemand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable\nwidespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically\nobserve that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the\naffirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware\nTest-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related\nparameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in\nconsistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in\nunrelated semantics.

Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is\nproposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of\npulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the\nin-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the\nsemi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of\nlabeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher\nmodel is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which\nreliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the\nstudent model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is\niteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:\nExtensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD\npatients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by\n2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is\nconducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the\ndifferences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.\nConclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of\npulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis.

However, the development of accurate and robust methods\nis often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in\nlesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for\ndata synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize\nlesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In\nthis paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel\nframework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and\nlocalized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,\nwhere the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that\nrepresents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical\ncoherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize\nlesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that\nguides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most\nrelevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing\ntheir interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise\ncontrol over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of\nsynthesized mammograms.

However, identifying\n3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite\nexplicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud\nbackbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to\nadequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the\ndisparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the\nscarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal\nscenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world\nabnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly\ndetection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key\naspects.

In the first stage, we\nenhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables\nstructural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,\nembedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and\nensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that\nprogressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a\nlightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and\ndownstream task demands.

However, existing methods predominantly\nrely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and\nprevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for\nauto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only\nframework that directly reconstructs occupancy.

To\novercome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation\nusing an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and\nscalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,\nand dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is\nexplicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly\nimproving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled\nto better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on\nthe Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry\nreconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from\ndiverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy\nmodels on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.\nIt highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy\nreconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception.

To\naddress these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)\na pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)\nand analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of\nprecise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D\nmodel represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose\nrelative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize\n3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images\nneeded -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the\nCNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.\nThis work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their\neffectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose\nestimates.

Project Page: https://bjkim95.github.io/haircup/", "summary": "We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair\ncompositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head\navatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as\nan inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the\nhuman head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and\nhair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such\nholistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle\nswapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of\nface and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this\napproach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair\nfrom studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture\nderived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and\nhairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,\nincorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective\nseparation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of\nface and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot\nmanner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D\nhead avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical\napplicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for\nflexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u8868\u793a\u76843D\u5934\u90e8\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u901a\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6574\u4f53\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u5206\u79bb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u76843D\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u53d1\u578b\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u65e0\u5934\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u5355\u76ee\u6355\u6349\u5fae\u8c03\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u53ef\u8868\u8fbe\u76843D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
