In this study, we investigate the\nseasonal variability of snow distribution and its impact on surface albedo and\nenergy fluxes across the marginal ice zone (MIZ), using a unique dataset from\nfive shipborne expeditions conducted between 2019 and 2024. High-resolution\nvisible and infrared imagery, combined with field observations and\nmeteorological data, reveal that even modest snow fractions substantially\nincrease surface reflectivity and suppress conductive heat transfer. Our\nresults demonstrate that simplified binary assumptions-such as assigning dry\nsnow in winter and bare ice in summer-systematically misrepresent surface\nconditions, introducing significant biases in modelled radiative and turbulent\nfluxes. By explicitly resolving fractional snow cover, we show that surface\nalbedo and energy exchange respond nonlinearly to snow-ice composition, with\nimplications for sea ice growth, melt, and climate feedbacks.

SAMEP implements a\ndistributed memory repository with vector-based semantic search, cryptographic\naccess controls (AES-256-GCM), and standardized APIs compatible with existing\nagent communication protocols (MCP, A2A). We demonstrate SAMEP's effectiveness\nacross diverse domains including multi-agent software development, healthcare\nAI with HIPAA compliance, and multi-modal processing pipelines. Experimental\nresults show 73% reduction in redundant computations, 89% improvement in\ncontext relevance scores, and complete compliance with regulatory requirements\nincluding audit trail generation.

An evaluative challenge facing FER\nalgorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions\ncompared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER\nalgorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and\nskin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices\nemployed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two\nstate-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and\nexamine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a\nmethodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a\nsignificant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to\nconsist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between\nspontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these\ndatasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be\ndeployed in in-the-wild applications.

Yet, a pressing\nchallenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot\nsettings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual\nclassification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a\nnon-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmodule. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three\nconfigurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II)\nfine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated\norchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops.\nUsing confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator\nmodulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\\% accuracy\nimprovement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG,\nachieving 85.63\\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL\ndisplayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with\nvisually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via\niterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision\nagents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable\nmulti-agent AI.

The corpus comprises MIDI files and data sheets of\nDastgah Shour from Radif Mirza Abdollah, the foundational repertoire of Iranian\nclassical music. Furthermore, we apply our previously-introduced algorithm for\nparsing melodic structure (Kanani et al., 2023b)to the dataset. Unlike much\nWestern music, this type of non-metric music does not follow bar-centric\norganisation. The non-metric organisation can be captured well by our parsing\nalgorithm. We parse each tune (Gusheh) into a grammar to identify motifs and\nphrases. These grammar representations can be useful for educational and\nethnomusicological purposes. We also further develop a previously-introduced\nmethod of creating melodic variations (Kanani et al., 2023b). After parsing an\nexisting tune to produce a grammar, by applying mutations to this grammar, we\ngenerate a new grammar. Expanding this new version yields a variation of the\noriginal tune.

However, research in this area is still fragmented across\ndifferent communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered\nframeworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the\nSemantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation\nobscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic\nunderstanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive\nevolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and\nthe MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations\nof earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To\nsystematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic\nfoundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery\nmechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing\nagent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent\nwhere others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift\nin the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic\nWeb) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model\n(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable\nand adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new\nprotocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,\ntrustworthy ecosystem.

This has sparked\nsignificant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with\nthe necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and\nAI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy\nconsumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering\nboth near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and\nbeyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net\npositive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,\nwe discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive\nworkflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and\nconsumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely\nstrain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and\ntherefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of\nbig data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and\ncomplex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and\napplications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more\npromising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction.

At predefined timepoints called \"decision points,\"\nintelligent mHealth systems such as just-in-time adaptive interventions\n(JITAIs) estimate an individual's biobehavioral context from sensor or survey\ndata and determine whether and how to intervene.

However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly\nfor individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after\nthe target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective.\nIn this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule\ndecision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times.

However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a\nsimplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural\nrepresentations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin\nto those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information\nredundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive\nperformance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight\narchitectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information\nprocessing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled\nby kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order\nspatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further\nmodulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise\nredundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently\ngather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental\nresults in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable\nparameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,\non the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M\nparameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver\nstrong performance through an efficient design.

Then, SISRNet systematically focuses on\nthese high-information regions during both image modeling and report\ngeneration, effectively capturing subtle abnormal findings, mitigating the\nnegative impact of data bias, and ultimately generating clinically accurate\nreports.

Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and\nlocal information have achieved promising results. However, existing methods\noften suffer from score over-smoothing, which blurs the distinction between\ncorrect and incorrect answers and hinders reasoning effectiveness. To address\nthis, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with\ndual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by\nsegregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message\npassing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways,\npreventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination.\nIn addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which\npartitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the\ncandidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which\nalleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality.

Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features\nto capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and\noften inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce\nfrequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches\nlimits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the\nDark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel\ndual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment\nacross spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two\nkey modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a\npixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance\nhaze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware\nspectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which\nfuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid\ngating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior\nCorrection Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback\nmechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed\nfeatures and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in\nchallenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze\ndatasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with\nsuperior robustness and real-time efficiency.

However,\nachieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian\nSplatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently\nambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these\nlimitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that\nenables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a\nrobust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction\n(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model\nview-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and\nconsistent part segmentations across viewpoints.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which\nis the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly\ndefine, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL\ncomprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation\n(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent\nsamples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives\nfor effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)\nHard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware\noptimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic\nlabels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives\ncloser in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability\nand robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the\npotential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust\nCC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the\ntargeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both\nPRCC and LTCC datasets.

Recent studies reveal that the goal of long\nvideo generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to\naccurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due\nto the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video\ngeneration models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on\nbenchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our\nknowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively\nevaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.\nInspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative\nunit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative\nAtom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.\nGuided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we\nconstruct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing\nevaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs.

However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes\nin the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type\nof splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent\nobject surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that\nthis can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality.\nThus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian\nSplatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its\nsurface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first\npropose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and\nrendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline.\nIn addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based\ninitialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its\nsurface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging\ndifferent types of primitives.

Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3\nfps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a\nstandard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost\n1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher\nthan 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.\n  In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989\nacross contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al.

Furthermore, when the foreground character\nundergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing\ndetails become evident.
