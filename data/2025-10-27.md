Abstract: The field of weather and climate science is at a pivotal moment, defined by
the dual forces of unprecedented technological advancement. While a shifting
research and employment landscape has created career uncertainty, leading to a
significant migration of talent toward the private sector, it has
simultaneously spurred an expansion of the ecosystem through the emergence of
new computational tools and the growing role of industry innovators and
stakeholders. This perspective paper argues that this new, expanded ecosystem
presents extraordinary opportunities for students and early-career
professionals. We outline the emerging scientific frontiers powered by
high-resolution simulations and artificial intelligence, suggest a practical
path for navigating a more fluid career landscape, and propose how education
and training must evolve to equip the next generation for success.

### [2] [Light scattering by random convex polyhedron in geometric optics approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21201)
*Quan Mu*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 提出基于凸包算法的新型冰晶几何模型，在几何光学近似下计算随机取向大冰晶的完整偏振散射矩阵，适用于任意凸多面体形状的冰晶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究卷云粒子的散射特性需要准确的冰晶几何模型和散射计算方法，现有模型存在局限性。

Abstract: Based on the convex hull construction algorithm, a new geometrical model of
ice crystals is proposed to investigate the scattering properties of cirrus
clouds particles. Light scattering matrices involving complete polarization
information are calculated in geometric optics approximation for randomly
oriented large crystals with random and given convex polyhedron shape. The
proposed model construction method and computational scheme of light scattering
matrix works for any convex polyhedron within the scope of geometrical optics.
To illustrate the broad applicability of the proposed ice crystal model,
scattering matrices for three ice crystal examples with different geometrical
shapes are calculated under a unified computational framework. Diffraction and
absorption are not considered in this work. The calculated results for the
classical hexagonal column model show overall agreement with those reported by
other authors. The crystal model and scattering matrix computational framework
developed in this study are applicable to radiative transfer simulations and
remote sensing data interpretation in terrestrial and planetary atmospheres.

### [3] [Space waste: An update of the anthropogenic matter injection into Earth atmosphere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21328)
*Leonard Schulz,Karl-Heinz Glassmeier,Moritz Herberhold,Adam Mitchell,Daniel M. Murphy,John M. C. Plane,Ferdinand Plaschke*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究更新了2015-2025年太空垃圾进入地球大气的元素注入估算，发现从2020年起太空垃圾质量通量急剧增加，多种金属元素已超过自然流星注入，可能对臭氧层、辐射和云形成产生长期不利影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型卫星星座的增加，大量太空垃圾在寿命结束后再入大气层，其燃烧产物注入中间层和低热层，需要评估这种人为注入与自然流星注入的对比及其潜在环境影响。

Method: 更新了Schulz & Glassmeier (2021)的太空垃圾注入估算，评估2015-2025年期间，考虑43种元素并与流星注入进行详细比较，同时分析未来质量通量情景。

Result: 2024年有24种元素的人为注入超过自然流星注入（2015年为18种），其中许多是已知具有催化活性的过渡金属，与平流层气溶胶数据吻合良好。

Conclusion: 太空垃圾注入已对大气构成实质性风险，可能导致臭氧消耗、辐射效应和云形成变化，急需研究特定元素在大气中的积累、化学反应和总体影响。

Abstract: Large satellite constellations are one of the main reasons for an increasing
amount of mass being brought into low Earth orbit in recent years. After end of
life, the satellites, as well as rocket stages, reenter Earth's atmosphere.
This space waste burns up and thus injects a substantial amount of its matter
into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. A first comprehensive analysis of
the anthropogenic injection and a comparison to the natural injection by
meteoroids was presented by Schulz & Glassmeier (2021). They found significant
and even the dominant injection of several metal elements regularly used in
spacecraft compared to the natural injection. The first observations of space
waste remnants in stratospheric aerosol particles (Murphy et al., 2023)
confirmed several of these estimates, but also revealed differences and new
insights. The current study presents an update to the space waste injection
estimates of Schulz & Glassmeier (2021), assessing the years from 2015 to 2025
but also considering future mass influx scenarios. 43 elements are considered
and thus a much more detailed comparison to the meteoric injection is possible.
Comparison of estimated elemental fluxes to stratospheric aerosol data shows
excellent agreement. From 2020 onward, a strong rise in space waste mass influx
to the atmosphere can be seen. Future scenarios discussed by Schulz &
Glassmeier (2021) may already be reached by the end of 2025. In 2024, 24
elements were dominating the meteoric injection compared to 18 in 2015. Several
of them are transition metals, which are known for their catalytic activity.
This indicates a substantial risk of long-term adverse effects on the
atmosphere such as ozone depletion, radiative effects and changes in cloud
formation, if no action is taken. Research is urgently needed into the
atmospheric accumulation, chemistry, and general atmospheric effects of
specific elements.

### [4] [Characterizing global tropical cyclone events of 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21507)
*Lingke Jiang,G. Brooke Anderson,Yanran Li,Xiao Wu,Victoria D. Lynch,Robbie M. Parks*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 2024年热带气旋影响评估显示，约4.3亿人（全球5.5%）受热带气旋风影响，近6000万人（0.8%）受飓风级风力影响，为全球抗灾和恢复工作提供参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 每年热带气旋的全面影响评估需要综合社会人口分析，以更好地指导抗灾和恢复工作。

Method: 评估2024年热带气旋影响区域的社会人口特征，并与1980-2024年的历史背景进行比较分析。

Result: 2024年热带气旋风力影响约4.3亿人（全球5.5%），飓风级风力影响近6000万人（0.8%）。

Conclusion: 研究结果为热带气旋提供了全球背景，有助于更好地指导抗灾和恢复工作。

Abstract: Full impact assessment of tropical cyclones each year requires a
comprehensive sociodemographic analysis. We evaluated sociodemographic
characteristics of tropical cyclone-impacted regions during the 2024 calendar
year in recent historical context of 1980-2024. In 2024, tropical cyclone-force
wind affected an estimated 429,902,820 people (5.5% of global population), and
hurricane-force wind an estimated 59,672,600 people (0.8%). Our findings
provide a global context for tropical cyclones to better guide resilience and
recovery efforts.

### [5] [Direct test for critical slowing down before Dansgaard-Oeschger events via the volcanic climate response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21539)
*Johannes Lohmann*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究测试了过去气候突变事件是否支持统计预警信号作为预测未来气候临界点的有效性。通过分析Dansgaard-Oeschger事件前的火山喷发响应，发现变暖过渡前没有临界减速证据，但冷却过渡前某些关键指标显示出临界减速特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证统计预警信号作为气候临界点预测工具的有效性，因为预警信号基于临界减速理论，但受噪声过程和测量平稳性等假设限制，这些假设难以验证。

Method: 通过分析过去冰川期Dansgaard-Oeschger事件前大型火山喷发的平均气候响应，直接测试临界减速现象。使用八个冰芯代理指标，通过平均数百次喷发构建定义良好的平稳扰动，测量平均气候响应。

Result: 在接近DO变暖过渡时，气候对火山喷发的响应保持不变，表明没有临界减速。但在接近DO冷却过渡时，某些关键代理显示出更大的气候响应和更慢的恢复速度。统计预警信号在冷却和变暖过渡前几乎在所有代理中都出现，但变暖过渡前的置信度较弱。

Conclusion: 临界减速和统计预警信号在定性上一致，即分岔前兆的证据在冷却过渡中更明显。但许多代理显示预警信号但没有直接临界减速（反之亦然）的差异表明，需要谨慎解释单个可观测变量中的统计预警信号。

Abstract: It is tested whether past abrupt climate changes support the validity of
statistical early-warning signals (EWS) as predictor of future climate tipping
points. EWS are expected increases in amplitude and correlation of fluctuations
driven by noise. This is a symptom of critical slowing down (CSD), where a
system's recovery from an external perturbation becomes slower as a tipping
point (represented by a bifurcation) is approached. EWS are a simple, indirect
measure of CSD, but subject to assumptions on the noise process and measurement
stationarity that are hard to verify. In this work the existence of CSD before
the Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events of the last glacial period is directly
tested by inferring the climate's recovery from large volcanic eruptions. By
averaging over hundreds of eruptions, a well-defined, stationary perturbation
is constructed and the average climate response is measured by eight ice core
proxies. As the abrupt DO warming transitions are approached, the climate
response to eruptions remains the same, indicating no CSD. For the abrupt DO
cooling transitions, however, some key proxies show evidence of larger climate
response and slower recovery as the transitions are approached. By comparison,
almost all proxies show statistical EWS before cooling and warming transitions,
but with only weak confidence for the warming transitions. There is thus
qualitative agreement of CSD and EWS, in that the evidence for bifurcation
precursors is larger for the cooling transitions. However, the discrepancy that
many proxies show EWS but no direct CSD (and vice versa) highlights that
statistical EWS in individual observables need to be interpreted with care.

### [6] [Seemingly Redundant Modules Enhance Robust Odor Learning in Fruit Flies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21315)
*Haiyang Li,Liao Yu,Qiang Yu,Yunliang Zang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该研究通过计算模型发现，果蝇嗅觉回路中的侧向抑制和神经元尖峰频率适应机制在噪声环境中具有互补作用，共同优化气味辨别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物回路中常包含执行相似功能的多个模块，但尚不清楚这些机制是冗余还是具有不同作用。本研究旨在探究果蝇嗅觉回路中侧向抑制和神经元尖峰频率适应在气味学习中的具体角色。

Method: 构建果蝇嗅觉回路的计算模型，在不同噪声条件下模拟复杂环境，研究气味辨别性能。

Result: 侧向抑制主要在低中噪声条件下提升气味辨别，但在高噪声下效果减弱甚至反转；尖峰频率适应在所有噪声水平下都能持续改善辨别性能；两种机制在不同噪声环境中优势互补。

Conclusion: 生物回路中看似冗余的模块实际上对于在复杂环境中实现最优学习至关重要，侧向抑制和尖峰频率适应机制协同工作实现最佳辨别性能。

Abstract: Biological circuits have evolved to incorporate multiple modules that perform
similar functions. In the fly olfactory circuit, both lateral inhibition (LI)
and neuronal spike frequency adaptation (SFA) are thought to enhance pattern
separation for odor learning. However, it remains unclear whether these
mechanisms play redundant or distinct roles in this process. In this study, we
present a computational model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate odor
discrimination under varying noise conditions that simulate complex
environments. Our results show that LI primarily enhances odor discrimination
in low- and medium-noise scenarios, but this benefit diminishes and may reverse
under higher-noise conditions. In contrast, SFA consistently improves
discrimination across all noise levels. LI is preferentially engaged in low-
and medium-noise environments, whereas SFA dominates in high-noise settings.
When combined, these two sparsification mechanisms enable optimal
discrimination performance. This work demonstrates that seemingly redundant
modules in biological circuits can, in fact, be essential for achieving optimal
learning in complex contexts.

### [7] [Unveiling the Spatial-temporal Effective Receptive Fields of Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21403)
*Jieyuan Zhang,Xiaolong Zhou,Shuai Wang,Wenjie Wei,Hanwen Liu,Qian Sun,Malu Zhang,Yang Yang,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了时空有效感受野(ST-ERF)来分析基于Transformer的脉冲神经网络的感受野分布，发现这些模型在建立稳健的全局ST-ERF方面存在问题。为此提出了MLPixer和SRB两种通道混合器架构来增强全局空间ERF，提升视觉长序列建模任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络在视觉长序列建模任务中难以达到有竞争力的性能，而有效感受野是分析视觉长序列建模中特征提取能力的重要工具。

Method: 引入时空有效感受野(ST-ERF)分析各种基于Transformer的SNNs的感受野分布，并提出MLPixer和SRB两种通道混合器架构来增强全局空间ERF。

Result: 在Meta-SDT变体和目标检测、语义分割任务上的广泛实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的ST-ERF框架可以为更广泛任务中设计和优化SNN架构提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) demonstrate significant potential for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing through an event-driven paradigm. While
training methods and computational models have greatly advanced, SNNs struggle
to achieve competitive performance in visual long-sequence modeling tasks. In
artificial neural networks, the effective receptive field (ERF) serves as a
valuable tool for analyzing feature extraction capabilities in visual
long-sequence modeling. Inspired by this, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal
Effective Receptive Field (ST-ERF) to analyze the ERF distributions across
various Transformer-based SNNs. Based on the proposed ST-ERF, we reveal that
these models suffer from establishing a robust global ST-ERF, thereby limiting
their visual feature modeling capabilities. To overcome this issue, we propose
two novel channel-mixer architectures:
\underline{m}ulti-\underline{l}ayer-\underline{p}erceptron-based
m\underline{ixer} (MLPixer) and \underline{s}plash-and-\underline{r}econstruct
\underline{b}lock (SRB). These architectures enhance global spatial ERF through
all timesteps in early network stages of Transformer-based SNNs, improving
performance on challenging visual long-sequence modeling tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on the Meta-SDT variants and across object detection and
semantic segmentation tasks further validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. Beyond these specific applications, we believe the proposed ST-ERF
framework can provide valuable insights for designing and optimizing SNN
architectures across a broader range of tasks. The code is available at

### [8] [Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Optimal User Order Routing: Multi-Objective Solver Optimization in CoW Protocol Batch Auctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21647)
*Mitchell Marfinetz*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种混合遗传算法架构，用于CoW协议批量拍卖中的区块链路由优化，结合多目标NSGA-II引擎和确定性基线方法，在拍卖截止时间内实现用户盈余、gas费用、滑点和执行风险的多目标优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性单目标启发式方法在区块链路由中经常无法充分利用跨多个并行路径的分流机会，也无法统一考虑gas、滑点和执行风险约束。需要一种能够处理多目标优化并适应实时拍卖环境的解决方案。

Method: 采用混合遗传算法架构，结合多目标NSGA-II引擎与自适应实例分析和确定性基线。核心引擎编码可变长度的路径集和连续分流比例，在帕累托目标向量F=(用户盈余,-gas,-滑点,-风险)下演化候选路由和容量分配。自适应控制器在GA和基于Bellman-Ford负环检测的双重分解优化器之间选择。

Result: 在14层基准测试中，混合方法在中小订单上实现约0.40-9.82 ETH的绝对用户盈余增益，收敛时间中位数约0.5秒（软上限1.0秒），在2秒限制内完成。系统通过8/8测试验证安全性和正确性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了首个公开记录的多目标遗传算法，具有端到端安全性，适用于实时DEX路由，能够在拍卖截止时间内实现多目标优化，为区块链路由问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: CoW Protocol batch auctions aggregate user intents and rely on solvers to
find optimal execution paths that maximize user surplus across heterogeneous
automated market makers (AMMs) under stringent auction deadlines. Deterministic
single-objective heuristics that optimize only expected output frequently fail
to exploit split-flow opportunities across multiple parallel paths and to
internalize gas, slippage, and execution risk constraints in a unified search.
We apply evolutionary multi-objective optimization to this blockchain routing
problem, proposing a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) architecture for real-time
solver optimization that combines a production-grade, multi-objective NSGA-II
engine with adaptive instance profiling and deterministic baselines. Our core
engine encodes variable-length path sets with continuous split ratios and
evolves candidate route-and-volume allocations under a Pareto objective vector
F = (user surplus, -gas, -slippage, -risk), enabling principled trade-offs and
anytime operation within the auction deadline. An adaptive controller selects
between GA and a deterministic dual-decomposition optimizer with Bellman-Ford
based negative-cycle detection, with a guarantee to never underperform the
baseline. The open-source system integrates six protection layers and passes
8/8 tests, validating safety and correctness. In a 14-stratum benchmark (30
seeds each), the hybrid approach yields absolute user-surplus gains of
approximately 0.40-9.82 ETH on small-to-medium orders, while large
high-fragmentation orders are unprofitable across gas regimes. Convergence
occurs in about 0.5 s median (soft capped at 1.0 s) within a 2-second limit. We
are not aware of an openly documented multi-objective GA with end-to-end safety
for real-time DEX routing.

### [9] [REvolution: An Evolutionary Framework for RTL Generation driven by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21407)
*Kyungjun Min,Kyumin Cho,Junhwan Jang,Seokhyeong Kang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: REvolution框架将进化计算与LLMs结合，用于自动生成和优化RTL代码，解决了功能正确性和PPA优化的挑战，通过双种群算法和自适应机制显著提高了生成代码的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLMs的RTL代码生成方法存在功能正确性和PPA优化不足的问题，且迭代反馈方法局限于局部搜索，难以找到全局最优解。

Method: 结合进化计算和LLMs，采用双种群算法将候选设计分为失败组和成功组分别进行错误修复和PPA优化，并引入自适应机制动态调整提示策略的选择概率。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM基准测试中，REvolution将各种LLMs的初始通过率提高了最高24.0个百分点，DeepSeek-V3模型达到95.5%的最终通过率，且生成的RTL设计在PPA方面显著优于参考设计。

Conclusion: REvolution通过结合LLMs的生成能力和进化计算的广泛搜索能力，克服了先前方法的局部搜索限制，为RTL设计提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code
generation, but they face two main challenges: functional correctness and
Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) optimization. Iterative, feedback-based
methods partially address these, but they are limited to local search,
hindering the discovery of a global optimum. This paper introduces REvolution,
a framework that combines Evolutionary Computation (EC) with LLMs for automatic
RTL generation and optimization. REvolution evolves a population of candidates
in parallel, each defined by a design strategy, RTL implementation, and
evaluation feedback. The framework includes a dual-population algorithm that
divides candidates into Fail and Success groups for bug fixing and PPA
optimization, respectively. An adaptive mechanism further improves search
efficiency by dynamically adjusting the selection probability of each prompt
strategy according to its success rate. Experiments on the VerilogEval and
RTLLM benchmarks show that REvolution increased the initial pass rate of
various LLMs by up to 24.0 percentage points. The DeepSeek-V3 model achieved a
final pass rate of 95.5\%, comparable to state-of-the-art results, without the
need for separate training or domain-specific tools. Additionally, the
generated RTL designs showed significant PPA improvements over reference
designs. This work introduces a new RTL design approach by combining LLMs'
generative capabilities with EC's broad search power, overcoming the
local-search limitations of previous methods.

### [10] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training方法，通过在适配器训练中为混淆因素提供捷径，防止目标属性与偶然因素的纠缠，提高生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于适配器的训练方法在捕获特定目标属性时，容易将目标属性与姿势、表情、光照等偶然因素纠缠在一起，这种虚假相关性限制了模型的泛化能力和对输入文本提示的遵循能力。

Method: 提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training方法，在适配器训练期间通过ControlNet或LoRA等辅助模块为混淆因素提供捷径，消除适配器内部化这些因素的动力，然后在推理时移除这些辅助模块。

Result: 当应用于面部和全身身份注入等任务时，该方法提高了生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，当寻求解耦表示时，最有效的路径可能是为不应该学习的内容建立捷径。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [11] [An Automatic Detection Method for Hematoma Features in Placental Abruption Ultrasound Images Based on Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21495)
*Xiaoqing Liu,Jitai Han,Hua Yan,Peng Li,Sida Tang,Ying Li,Kaiwen Zhang,Min Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出改进的EH-YOLOv11n模型，通过小样本学习实现胎盘超声图像中血肿特征的自动检测，检测准确率达78%，比YOLOv11n提升2.5%，比YOLOv8提升13.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎盘早剥是妊娠期严重并发症，传统超声诊断方法依赖医生经验，存在主观偏差和诊断不一致性问题，需要自动准确的诊断方案。

Method: 基于小样本学习改进YOLOv11n模型，集成小波卷积和坐标卷积增强频域和空间特征提取，引入级联分组注意力机制抑制超声伪影和遮挡干扰，提高边界框定位精度。

Result: 实验结果显示检测准确率78%，在精确率-召回率曲线、置信度得分和遮挡场景下表现显著优越，兼具高精度和实时处理能力。

Conclusion: 该模型为胎盘早剥的计算机辅助诊断提供了可靠解决方案，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) 是一种新的视频生成范式，通过将参考视频作为语义提示，利用冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer和可插拔的Mixture-of-Transformers专家实现统一、可泛化的语义控制，无需特定条件微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中统一、可泛化语义控制的关键挑战，现有方法要么引入伪影，要么依赖不可泛化的特定条件微调或任务特定架构。

Method: 使用参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer和可插拔的Mixture-of-Transformers专家架构，结合时间偏置位置嵌入来消除虚假映射先验。

Result: 作为单一统一模型，VAP在开源方法中达到最先进水平，获得38.7%的用户偏好率，与领先的特定条件商业模型相当，并展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: VAP在通用可控视频生成方面取得了显著进展，支持各种下游应用，标志着向通用目的可控视频生成的重要进步。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出GenPT生成式点跟踪框架，通过流匹配建模多模态轨迹，在遮挡点跟踪上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前判别式模型在跟踪点轨迹时只能回归到均值/众数，无法捕捉多模态不确定性，特别是在视觉遮挡和外观变化时

Method: 使用流匹配框架，结合判别式跟踪器的迭代细化、跨窗口一致性的窗口依赖先验，以及针对点坐标优化的方差调度

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中表现优异，特别在遮挡点跟踪上达到SOTA，同时可见点跟踪性能保持竞争力

Conclusion: GenPT能够有效捕捉点轨迹的多模态特性，显著提升遮挡点跟踪准确性，为点跟踪任务提供了生成式解决方案

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

TL;DR: 3DReasonKnee是首个用于医学图像的3D基础推理数据集，包含494k个高质量五元组，支持解剖区域的3D定位和逐步推理，填补了现有3D医学图像数据集的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型难以在3D医学图像中定位解剖区域并进行逐步推理，这是真实世界诊断评估的关键要求。现有3D数据集提供定位标签但不支持这种"基础推理"能力。

Method: 创建3DReasonKnee数据集，包含7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积，每个样本包括：3D MRI体积、针对特定解剖区域的诊断问题、3D边界框定位、临床医生生成的诊断推理步骤、结构化严重程度评估。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估框架，基准测试了5个最先进的视觉语言模型，为3D基础推理和严重程度评估提供了基线性能。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的存储库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐的定位决策能力提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标注稀缺领域性能下降的问题，传统监督微调不可行，而生成语言模型的自监督适应策略在视觉编码器模型中效果不佳。

Method: 基于自蒸馏范式，使用多视角物体中心视频进行自监督微调，精心调整预测头并部署参数高效适应技术，防止模型遗忘预训练知识。

Conclusion: VESSA通过多视角物体观察有效学习对多样化捕获条件的鲁棒性，无需标注即可成功适应视觉基础模型到新领域。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计流程在工业环境中面临检测瓶颈，特别是在杂乱、光照差和复杂背景等挑战条件下性能下降。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，采用低光图像增强和基于开放词汇检测的背景去除，抑制原始SAM输出中的误报，为下游姿态估计提供更可靠的检测。

Result: 在真实工业bin-picking基准测试上的大量实验表明，该方法显著提升检测精度，同时带来可忽略的推理开销。

Conclusion: 该方法在工业环境中有效且实用，能够显著提升未见物体的检测性能。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 研究表明通过图像数据收集、标注和深度学习方法，可以在不同损伤情境下实现快速自动化的灾害后损伤检测。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

Motivation: 现有3D场景图生成方法局限于单视图、不支持增量更新、缺乏3D几何接地，这些对于具身场景至关重要。

Method: 利用VLM推理生成丰富的2D场景图，然后通过深度信息将其接地到3D空间，节点包含开放词汇对象特征、3D位置和语义上下文，边捕获空间和语义关系及物体间距离。

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架成功实现了零样本3D场景图生成，支持增量更新和几何接地，为下游机器人应用提供了有效的场景理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveSeg是一种新颖的解码器架构，通过联合优化空间域和小波域的特征细化，利用小波域频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，在语义分割任务中实现高效精确的分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义分割网络过度依赖强大的预训练编码器，但大多采用简单的解码器，导致语义上下文和细粒度细节保留之间的权衡不理想。

Method: 提出WaveSeg解码器架构：1）从小波域学习高频分量作为显式先验；2）应用双域操作（DDO）进行多尺度融合；3）提出频谱分解注意力（SDA）块，利用Mamba的线性复杂度长程建模；4）使用重参数化卷积在小波域保持低频语义完整性；5）残差引导融合集成多尺度特征。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，WaveSeg在定量和定性上都持续优于最先进的方法，实现了高效和精确的分割。

Conclusion: WaveSeg通过小波域频率先验与基于Mamba的注意力机制相结合，能够产生语义和结构丰富的特征图，在语义分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在肠肌丛分类任务中表现良好但缺乏可解释性，且不符合医生的决策方式，需要将专家知识融入模型以提高临床相关性。

Method: 基于对比语言-图像预训练的视觉语言模型，使用LLM生成专家来源的提示文本，通过QuiltNet编码，将临床相关语义线索与视觉特征对齐。

Result: 模型在准确率(83.9%)、精确率(86.6%)和特异性(87.6%)上均优于VGG-19、ResNet-18和ResNet-50等CNN模型。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有潜力，融入专家知识可以产生更具临床相关性的模型输出。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

Conclusion: HistRetinex是一种高效的低光照图像增强方法，在保持良好增强效果的同时显著提升了处理速度

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是视觉推理的重要扩展，当前模型在主动推理能力上存在根本性差距，需要进一步发展能够主动探索环境并整合信息的智能体。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向对象的、不确定性感知的城市规模LiDAR变化检测方法，通过多分辨率NDT和点面ICP对齐，结合几何和语义信息进行跨时期关联，在保持内存效率的同时实现高精度变化检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DSM差分和基于图像的方法对垂直偏差、地面坡度和视角失配敏感，而基于点的神经模型和体素编码需要大量内存且假设完美预对齐，无法处理分裂/合并情况且忽略不确定性。

Method: 使用多分辨率NDT和点面ICP进行时期对齐，通过注册协方差和表面粗糙度计算检测水平，结合几何代理、语义分割和类约束二分图分配来处理分裂合并，采用分块处理控制内存使用。

Result: 在15个代表性Subiaco区块上达到95.2%准确率、90.4% mF1和82.6% mIoU，在Decreased类别上IoU达到74.8%，比Triplet KPConv提高7.6个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法在城市规模LiDAR变化检测中表现出色，特别是在处理分裂合并情况和不确定性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

*Alec Helbling,Shruti Palaskar,Kundan Krishna,Polo Chau,Leon Gatys,Joseph Yitan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SafetyPairs框架，通过生成仅安全相关特征不同的图像对来系统研究图像安全性，构建了包含3020对图像的安全基准，用于评估和改进视觉语言模型的安全识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集标注粗糙模糊，无法隔离驱动安全差异的具体特征。需要系统区分良性图像和问题图像，因为图像的细微变化（如侮辱性手势或符号）会彻底改变其安全性含义。

Method: 利用图像编辑模型对图像进行针对性修改，仅改变与安全策略相关的特征，从而翻转安全标签，同时保持安全无关细节不变。通过这种方法构建反事实图像对。

Result: 构建了包含3020对SafetyPair图像的安全基准，涵盖9个安全类别。该基准能有效揭示视觉语言模型在区分细微差异图像方面的弱点，并可作为数据增强策略提高轻量级防护模型的训练效率。

Conclusion: SafetyPairs框架提供了首个系统研究细粒度图像安全差异的资源，既能用于模型评估，又能作为数据增强工具提升防护模型的性能。

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NoisyGRPO框架，通过注入高斯噪声到视觉输入来增强探索，并使用贝叶斯方法估计优势函数，从而提升多模态大语言模型的推理泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在提升多模态大语言模型的链式思维推理能力时，往往难以泛化到训练分布之外。

Method: 1. 噪声注入探索策略：在视觉输入中加入可控高斯噪声，鼓励模型在更广泛的视觉场景中探索；2. 贝叶斯优势估计：将优势估计建模为贝叶斯推断问题，结合噪声水平和轨迹奖励计算稳健的后验优势估计。

Result: 在标准CoT质量、通用能力和幻觉基准测试中，NoisyGRPO显著提高了泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在小规模MLLMs（如Qwen2.5-VL 3B）的RL设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过系统性的多模态RL框架，有效解决了MLLMs在CoT推理中的泛化问题，为提升小规模模型的推理能力提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于CycleGAN的级联合成器方法，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA，以规避碘对比剂带来的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CTPA依赖碘对比剂，存在肾毒性和过敏反应风险，特别是在高危患者中。

Method: 使用基于CycleGAN的级联合成器，在410对CTPA和NCCT扫描上进行训练和验证。

Result: 该方法在定量指标(MAE、PSNR、SSIM)和定性可视化方面表现最佳，血管分割和量化任务也显著优于NCCT输入。

Conclusion: DCCTPA能有效增强血管结构，特别是小血管，为高风险患者提供更安全的诊断替代方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG)作为视觉空间智能的网格化结构化表示方法，通过显式编码物体布局和空间关系来解决基础模型中空间智能评估的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型中的视觉空间智能评估主要依赖纯文本提示和VQA式评分，这种方法模糊了几何信息、引入了语言捷径，且难以归因于真正的空间技能。

Method: 开发了SIG结构化网格模式，作为文本的补充通道，提供场景结构的忠实组合表示。基于SIG构建评估指标，量化模型的内在视觉空间智能。

Result: 在少样本上下文学习中，SIG相比纯VQA表示在所有VSI指标上都获得了更大、更稳定、更全面的提升。发布了包含1.4K驾驶帧的SIGBench基准数据集。

Conclusion: SIG作为数据标注和训练模式，在学习和评估视觉空间智能方面展现出巨大潜力，能够有效分离空间能力与语言先验。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM)框架，将生成轨迹划分为多个时间段，每个段由专门的小型速度块建模，提高推理效率和样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Flow Matching模型使用单一大型网络学习从噪声到数据的整个生成轨迹，难以同时捕捉不同时间步的显著信号特征，且推理成本高昂。

Method: 采用分块设计，将生成轨迹划分为多个时间段，每个段由专门的速度块建模；引入语义特征引导模块，使速度块基于预训练表示的语义丰富特征；提出轻量级特征残差近似策略。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上的实验表明，BFM相比现有Flow Matching方法建立了显著改进的Pareto前沿，在保持相似生成性能的同时实现了2.1倍到4.9倍的推理复杂度加速。

Conclusion: BFM通过分块设计和语义特征引导，有效解决了传统Flow Matching模型的局限性，在提高推理效率的同时提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP是一种基于CLIP的零样本异常检测框架，通过动态令牌对齐机制实现细粒度异常学习，将视觉令牌与可学习的文本子空间进行定制化对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用单一文本空间来对齐不同对象和领域的视觉语义，这种无差别对齐阻碍了模型准确捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Method: 提出令牌级适配框架，将令牌无关的文本空间扩展为一组正交子空间，通过最优传输问题动态分配每个令牌到语义相关的子空间组合，并使用top-k掩码稀疏化传输计划。

Result: 大量实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性能。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过动态令牌对齐机制有效提升了零样本异常检测的准确性和细粒度学习能力。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

Motivation: 现有静态基准存在数据污染和饱和风险，导致性能评估失真，需要更可靠的评估协议。

Method: 使用图表示VQA样本，通过知识增强的基准演进(KBE)框架，整合多模态知识重构和扩展问题，实现难度可控的动态评估。

Result: 实验表明KBE能缓解数据污染和饱和问题，提供更全面的MLLM能力评估。

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了更可靠、动态的评估方法。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成和拓扑约束成功实现了高质量3D网格生成，在效率和保真度方面表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

Motivation: 3DGS虽然具有照片级实时渲染能力，但缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性，限制了其在视觉语言导航(VLN)中的应用。

Method: 提出SAGE-3D框架，包含：(1)对象中心语义标注，为3DGS添加对象级细粒度标注；(2)物理感知执行连接，在3DGS中嵌入碰撞对象并构建丰富的物理接口。

Result: 构建了包含1K对象标注3DGS室内场景数据的InteriorGS，以及首个基于3DGS的VLN基准SAGE-Bench（含2M VLN数据）。实验显示3DGS场景数据更难收敛但泛化性强，在VLN-CE Unseen任务上提升基线性能31%。

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS升级为语义和物理对齐的可执行环境，显著提升了VLN任务的性能，为缩小模拟与现实差距提供了有效工具。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出VL-SAE稀疏自编码器，将视觉-语言表示映射到统一概念集，实现多模态表示的可解释性，并能增强视觉-语言对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言模型的多模态对齐组件缺乏可解释性，难以将多模态表示的语义映射到统一概念集。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器编码视觉-语言表示，通过距离编码器和模态特定解码器确保语义相似表示具有一致的神经元激活，建立神经元-概念关联。

Result: 在多个VLM模型上验证，VL-SAE能有效解释和增强视觉-语言对齐，在零样本图像分类和幻觉消除等下游任务中提升性能。

Conclusion: VL-SAE为视觉-语言对齐提供了概念级解释，并能通过概念级对齐增强模型性能，是多模态表示可解释性的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

TL;DR: FORM是一个机器学习框架，用于预测扰动诱导的三维细胞结构变化，通过形态编码器和扩散模型捕捉细胞形态在扰动条件下的演变轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算框架仅限于二维表示，无法捕捉细胞形态在扰动下的复杂性，这限制了准确虚拟细胞模型的发展。

Method: FORM包含形态编码器（通过多通道VQGAN端到端训练学习紧凑3D表示）和基于扩散的扰动轨迹模块，在包含65,000多个3D细胞体积的大规模数据集上训练。

Result: FORM支持无条件形态合成和条件模拟扰动细胞状态，能够预测下游信号活动、模拟组合扰动效应，并建模未见扰动的形态动力学转换。

Conclusion: FORM和MorphoEval通过高分辨率预测模拟连接形态、扰动和功能，推动3D虚拟细胞的实现。

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CNN-Transformer-CLIP（CT-CLIP）多分支识别框架，结合CNN提取局部病变细节特征和Vision Transformer捕获全局结构关系，通过自适应特征融合模块动态融合特征，在复杂果园环境中有效识别苹果叶部病害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多尺度特征融合方法在复杂果园环境中面临挑战，因为不同苹果叶部病害的表型异质性导致病变形态和分布多样性，这些方法仅整合CNN提取的多层特征，未能充分考虑局部和全局特征之间的关系。

Method: 提出CT-CLIP多分支识别框架：使用CNN提取局部病变细节特征，Vision Transformer捕获全局结构关系，自适应特征融合模块（AFFM）动态融合这些特征；采用多模态图像-文本学习方法，利用预训练CLIP权重实现视觉特征与病害语义描述的深度对齐。

Result: 在公开苹果病害数据集和自建数据集上分别达到97.38%和96.12%的准确率，优于多个基线方法，在复杂环境条件下显著提高了识别准确率。

Conclusion: CT-CLIP在农业病害识别方面表现出强大能力，为农业应用中的自动化病害识别提供了创新且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态语义感知相关建模跟踪框架，通过动态语义相关性生成器增强搜索区域从模板中提取重要信息的能力，提高了无人机跟踪在相机运动、快速运动和低分辨率等挑战下的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪方法主要强调速度而缺乏语义感知探索，这阻碍了搜索区域从模板中提取准确的定位信息，导致在典型无人机跟踪挑战下性能不佳。

Method: 提出了动态语义感知相关建模跟踪框架，核心是动态语义相关性生成器，结合Transformer的相关图探索语义相关性，并设计了剪枝方法来提高跟踪速度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了无人机跟踪中的语义感知不足问题，提高了在挑战性场景下的跟踪性能，同时提供了灵活的速度-准确性权衡方案。

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅需在训练时使用眼动数据的视觉语言模型正则化框架，通过眼动引导的注意力机制提升自我中心视角下的未来事件预测和当前活动理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼动数据能提供关于注意力、短期意图和未来行动的有价值线索，是建模自我中心行为的强大信号。

Method: 使用眼动正则化注意力机制，将模型关注点与人类视觉注视对齐，该设计灵活模块化，可泛化到多种使用注意力的VLM架构。

Result: 相比无眼动正则化的基线模型，未来事件预测的语义预测分数提升高达11分，当前活动理解提升约7分。

Conclusion: 眼动引导训练能显著提高自我中心VLM的准确性和鲁棒性，为在辅助机器人和人机协作等现实场景中增强VLM预测能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的合成CT生成管道，使用2.5D U-Net++架构和IMPACT-Synth感知损失，评估了两种配准策略（Elastix和IMPACT），发现IMPACT能提供更准确的结构对齐但存在评估偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成CT生成中配准误差传播到监督学习的问题，开发更鲁棒和可泛化的sCT合成模型。

Method: 使用2.5D U-Net++架构，ResNet-34编码器，结合像素级L1损失和IMPACT-Synth感知损失，评估Elastix和IMPACT两种配准策略。

Result: 在本地测试集上，IMPACT配准实现了更准确的结构对齐和更低的MAE，但在公共验证集上Elastix配准得分更高，反映了评估偏差。

Conclusion: 配准误差会影响监督学习的训练和评估，IMPACT通过促进解剖一致性对齐来减轻这种偏差，支持开发更鲁棒的sCT合成模型。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于实时网络带宽约束的自适应扩散模型框架，通过端到端训练使模型能够根据可用带宽调整生成质量，避免不必要的计算浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用固定步数的去噪过程，不考虑下游传输限制，在带宽受限的云到设备场景中会导致过度压缩和计算浪费。

Method: 引入联合端到端训练策略，通过轻量级质量嵌入引导去噪过程，使模型能够根据目标质量水平自适应调制去噪过程，实现早期停止采样。

Result: 实验结果表明，相比简单的早期停止方法，该方法显著提高了带宽适应生成的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法为带宽受限环境中的高效图像传输提供了有前景的解决方案，仅需最小架构改动。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Motivation: 当前生成式数据增强框架是任务孤立的，每个视觉任务需要训练独立的生成模型，并且忽略了地理信息和空间约束的建模。

Method: TerraGen引入了地理空间布局编码器，统一了边界框和分割掩码输入，结合多尺度注入方案和掩码加权损失来显式编码从全局结构到精细细节的空间约束。

Conclusion: TerraGen展示了强大的跨任务泛化能力，为遥感视觉任务提供了一种统一的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法通过深度一致性约束和优化策略，成功解决了视差引起的图像拼接问题，在保持最优性能的同时显著提高了算法效率。

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

Conclusion: ArtiLatent为关节3D物体的合成和操作提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，能够生成具有精细几何、准确关节和逼真外观的3D物体，显著提升了跨关节配置的视觉真实感。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and

### [52] [Anisotropic Pooling for LUT-realizable CNN Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21437)
*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种各向异性池化策略来改进基于查找表（LUT）的图像恢复CNN方法，通过广义中值池化和学习数据依赖的池化系数来替代传统的平均池化，从而更好地处理各向异性信号结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LUT的CNN图像恢复方法使用平均池化融合不同方向的像素块结果，但这种方法不适合处理各向异性信号结构，限制了性能提升。

Method: 引入广义中值池化方法，并进一步扩展为学习数据依赖的池化系数，使不同方向的像素块贡献能够自适应加权。

Result: 在各种恢复基准测试中，所提出的各向异性池化策略在感知质量和数值指标上都优于现有的LUT可实现的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化策略能够有效提升基于LUT的CNN图像恢复方法的性能，特别是在处理各向异性信号结构时表现更佳。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

*Lisa Weijler,Sebastian Koch,Fabio Poiesi,Timo Ropinski,Pedro Hermosilla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenHype提出了一种使用双曲潜在空间表示3D场景层次结构的新方法，解决了现有方法在效率和泛化性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建模3D对象和场景的层次结构对于自主代理全面理解环境至关重要，但现有隐式表示方法存在多渲染通道导致推理时间增加，或依赖预定义离散层次结构泛化性差的问题。

Method: 使用连续双曲潜在空间表示场景层次结构，利用双曲几何特性自然编码多尺度关系，通过潜在空间中的测地路径实现层次结构的平滑遍历。

Result: 在标准基准测试中优于最先进方法，展示了在3D场景理解方面更高的效率和适应性。

Conclusion: OpenHype通过双曲几何表示有效解决了3D场景层次建模的挑战，为自主代理提供了更好的环境理解能力。

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Motivation: 从有限的真实世界视频数据中学习物理一致的动态模型具有挑战性，特别是对于具有空间变化物理特性的可变形物体。

Method: 首先在MPM模拟器中构建物理一致的数字孪生，然后对物理属性进行部分感知扰动生成多样化运动模式，最后使用这些演示训练轻量级GNN世界模型。

Result: PhysWorld实现了对各种可变形物体的准确快速未来预测，并能很好地泛化到新的交互场景。

Conclusion: PhysWorld在保持竞争力的同时，实现了比现有最先进方法快47倍的推理速度。

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MoniTor方法，一种基于记忆的在线评分队列方案，用于无训练的视频异常检测，通过在预训练视觉语言模型中引入流式输入、LSTM启发的预测机制和动态评分队列，有效解决在线VAD的实时性和计算复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频异常检测研究主要关注离线方法，而在线VAD由于实时约束和计算强度很少受到关注。本文旨在解决在线VAD的固有复杂性，利用大语言模型和视觉语言模型的潜力实现更细致的异常理解。

Method: MoniTor采用流式输入到VLMs，结合LSTM启发的预测机制来捕获时间依赖性，设计评分队列和异常先验来动态存储最近分数并覆盖监控场景中的所有异常，为LLMs提供区分正常和异常行为的指导。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence两个大型数据集上的评估表明，MoniTor优于最先进方法，并且在不训练的情况下与弱监督方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MoniTor通过创新的记忆机制和在线评分方案，成功解决了在线视频异常检测的挑战，展示了在无训练条件下实现高性能异常检测的可行性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidSplice将视频修复分解为多帧一致性图像修复和掩码区域运动传播两个子任务，通过间隔帧先验和拼接机制提升时空稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在严重内容退化时表现不佳，且忽视时空稳定性，导致对视频后半部分控制不足

Method: 提出VidSplice框架，包含CoSpliced模块进行首帧传播策略，以及上下文控制器模块注入拼接视频到I2V生成主干

Result: 在多样化视频修复场景中取得竞争性表现，显著提升前景对齐和运动稳定性

Conclusion: VidSplice通过解耦任务和引入时空线索，有效解决了现有方法在内容退化和时空稳定性方面的局限性

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CXR-LanIC是一个用于胸部X光诊断的可解释AI框架，通过任务对齐模式发现从预训练分类器中提取可解释的视觉模式，实现了准确性和可解释性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中的黑盒问题，为临床医生提供透明、可验证的解释，以增强对自动化诊断的信任并识别潜在失败模式。

Method: 在BiomedCLIP诊断分类器上训练基于转码器的稀疏自编码器，将医学图像表示分解为可解释的视觉模式。通过在MIMIC-CXR数据集上训练100个转码器，发现了约5,000个单语义模式。

Result: 在五个关键发现上实现了有竞争力的诊断准确性，同时提供了透明归因，预测可分解为20-50个可解释模式，并具有可验证的激活图库。

Conclusion: CXR-LanIC证明了医学AI系统可以同时具备准确性和可解释性，通过透明、临床基础的解释支持更安全的临床部署。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Motivation: 现有病理基础模型主要关注全局组织上下文，但忽略了细胞级特征建模，这对于癌症亚型分类等细粒度任务至关重要。

Method: 采用双流架构，包含组织流和细胞流；提出接受度加权的键值聚合模型（循环变换器）以线性复杂度捕获细胞间依赖关系；引入双向组织-细胞交互模块实现局部细胞线索与周围组织环境的相互关注。

Result: 在四个组织病理学亚型分类基准测试中，所提方法优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 细胞级聚合和组织-细胞交互在细粒度计算病理学中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

Conclusion: 块级优化为基于GRPO的方法展现了良好前景，通过将优化范式从步级转向块级，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法无法捕捉学生模型认知能力的动态演变，导致知识传递效果不佳

Method: 基于Gompertz曲线的阶段感知蒸馏策略，动态调整蒸馏损失权重；使用Wasserstein距离度量特征差异，梯度匹配对齐反向传播行为；多损失目标统一框架

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，使用ResNet50和MobileNet_v2等架构，比传统蒸馏方法分别提升8%和4%准确率

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN通过模拟学习进程的动态调整机制，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Motivation: 现有的Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)方法基于不同的理论解释，限制了设计空间并模糊了关键设计选择。需要统一视角来理解和完善条件引导机制。

Method: 将条件引导重新框架为定点迭代问题，寻找生成一致输出的黄金路径。提出Foresight Guidance (FSG)，在早期扩散阶段优先解决更长间隔的子问题并增加迭代次数。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型架构上的广泛实验验证了FSG在图像质量和计算效率方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为条件引导提供了新的视角，并释放了自适应设计的潜力。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

TL;DR: 该研究将后验解释方法应用于基于神经网络的海洋动物检测模型，以增强生态学中对AI模型的信任度，通过评估解释的定位保真度、忠实性和诊断效用，揭示了模型的局限性并提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态学中计算机视觉应用滞后，部分原因是缺乏对黑盒神经网络模型的信任。研究旨在通过后验解释方法为预测提供证据，并记录野外部署的重要限制。

Method: 使用Glacier Bay国家公园的航空图像训练Faster R-CNN检测海豹，并应用梯度类激活映射（HiResCAM、LayerCAM）、局部可解释模型无关解释（LIME）和基于扰动的解释方法。

Result: 解释集中在海豹躯干和轮廓而非周围环境，移除海豹会降低检测置信度。分析揭示了系统性错误源，包括海豹与黑冰和岩石的混淆。

Conclusion: 通过将目标检测与后验可解释性结合，可以超越"黑盒"预测，开发出可审计的、支持决策的保护监测工具。

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foley Control是一种轻量级视频引导Foley方法，通过冻结预训练的单模态模型，仅学习它们之间的小型交叉注意力桥接来实现视频到音频的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要端到端重新训练多模态系统，计算成本高且缺乏模块化。本文旨在开发一种轻量级方法，在保持预训练模型性能的同时实现视频-音频同步。

Method: 连接V-JEPA2视频嵌入到冻结的Stable Audio Open DiT文本到音频模型，在现有文本交叉注意力后插入紧凑的视频交叉注意力，通过池化视频token来减少内存和稳定训练。

Result: 在精选的视频-音频基准测试中，Foley Control在时间和语义对齐方面表现有竞争力，参数量远少于最近的多模态系统，同时保持提示驱动的可控性和生产友好的模块化。

Conclusion: Foley Control提供了一种高效且模块化的视频到Foley生成方法，相同的桥接设计可扩展到其他音频模态如语音。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATrack是一个专门为夜间无人机跟踪设计的系统，通过多尺度层次融合、自适应关键令牌门控和夜间模板校准器三个核心模块，解决了夜间跟踪中的特征一致性、复杂背景识别和长期稳定跟踪等关键问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪面临低光照条件、复杂背景和频繁视角变化等挑战，现有方法存在视觉伪影、计算成本高和难以充分利用动态对象信息等问题。

Method: MATrack采用三个核心模块：多尺度层次融合增强静态和动态模板间的特征一致性，自适应关键令牌门控准确识别复杂背景中的目标信息，夜间模板校准器确保长期序列中的稳定跟踪性能。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，MATrack的精度、归一化精度和AUC分别比最先进方法提高了5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。真实无人机平台测试验证了系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: MATrack能够为夜间搜救和边境巡逻等关键机器人应用提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

TL;DR: TIGER是一个两阶段的文本图像超分辨率框架，通过"文本优先，图像后处理"范式，先重建精确的文本结构再指导全图像超分辨率，解决了传统方法在图像质量和文本可读性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本，造成图像质量和文本可读性之间的根本性权衡。

Method: TIGER采用两阶段框架：第一阶段重建精确的文本结构（字形恢复），第二阶段使用这些文本结构来指导后续的全图像超分辨率（图像增强）。

Result: TIGER实现了最先进的性能，在保持整体图像质量的同时显著提升了文本可读性。

Conclusion: TIGER通过解耦字形恢复和图像增强，打破了图像超分辨率中图像质量和文本可读性之间的权衡，为场景文本超分辨率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

*Pauline Mouches,Julien Jung,Armand Demasson,Agnès Guinard,Romain Bouet,Rosalie Marchal,Romain Quentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出两种深度学习模型（ANN和CNN）用于自动检测MEG记录中的癫痫发作间期棘波，在仅有单专家标注的真实临床数据上表现优于现有方法，并采用交互式机器学习策略提高标注质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耐药性癫痫术前评估中，MEG检测癫痫发作间期棘波对定位癫痫灶很重要，但手动检测既繁琐又容易出错，现有自动化方法要么需要大量标注数据，要么在非典型数据上缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出两种模型架构：基于特征的人工神经网络（ANN）和卷积神经网络（CNN），在59名患者数据上训练，采用交互式机器学习策略迭代改进数据标注质量。

Result: 两种模型在10名测试患者上的表现均优于现有最优模型（F1分数：CNN=0.46，ANN=0.44），交互式机器学习策略证明模型对噪声标注具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单架构的模型在分析复杂且标注不完美的数据时表现出鲁棒性，交互式机器学习方法为快速数据标注提供了潜力，模型是自动检测癫痫发作间期棘波的有效工具。

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测面临数据受限问题，昂贵的像素级标注导致相关子任务需要单独训练模型。

Method: 使用多模态扩散管道创建包含139,000+高分辨率图像的S3OD数据集，通过扩散和DINO-v3特征提取标签；提出流线型多掩码解码器处理检测中的固有模糊性。

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型在跨数据集泛化中实现20-50%错误率降低，微调版本在DIS和HR-SOD基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 大规模合成数据和模糊感知架构能显著提升显著目标检测的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源受限场景下，大规模预训练模型（如CLIP）因数据质量差或相关性弱而导致的过度自信和性能下降问题

Method: 使用随机扰动引入可控噪声模拟不确定性，结合嵌入平滑校准嵌入空间中的相似度分布，共同降低过度自信

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，Modest-Align在检索任务中优于最先进方法，仅用CLIP 1/100的训练数据和1/600的GPU时间就取得了竞争性结果

Conclusion: 该方法为现实世界低资源场景下的跨模态对齐提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过极线几何约束来改进视频扩散模型，解决几何不一致、不稳定运动和视觉伪影问题，使用基于偏好的优化方法直接处理相机轨迹不稳定和几何伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然在潜在扩散变换器和整流流技术方面取得进展，但仍存在几何不一致、不稳定运动和视觉伪影问题，无法呈现逼真的3D场景。3D一致视频生成对下游生成和重建任务具有重要影响。

Method: 使用成对极线几何约束通过基于偏好的优化来对齐扩散模型，直接处理不稳定相机轨迹和几何伪影，无需端到端可微分性。在静态场景和动态相机上进行训练以确保高质量测量。

Result: 评估表明，经典几何约束比现代学习指标提供更稳定的优化信号，学习指标会产生噪声目标而损害对齐质量。模型能有效泛化到多样化的动态内容。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种实用方法，在不损害视觉质量的情况下生成空间一致的视频。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

TL;DR: 提出DAP-MAE方法，通过自适应整合跨领域点云数据集知识来解决点云数据稀缺问题，在预训练和微调阶段分别采用不同模式，实现通用点云分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云数据在不同领域的训练数据规模有限，现有方法混合不同领域数据进行MAE预训练，但学到的先验知识与下游任务不匹配，导致性能下降。

Method: 设计异构领域适配器，预训练时使用适应模式全面学习跨领域信息，微调时使用融合模式增强点云特征；引入领域特征生成器指导特征适应不同下游任务。

Result: 仅需一次预训练，在四个点云分析任务中表现优异：ScanObjectNN物体分类达95.18%，Bosphorus面部表情识别达88.45%。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE能有效解决跨领域点云数据整合问题，通过自适应机制在单一预训练中实现多任务优异性能。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了长尾识别方法在野生动物物种识别中的应用，在NACTI数据集上实现了99.40%的Top-1准确率，显著优于95.51%的基线，并在跨域测试中展示了更强的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野外数据收集通常存在严重的类别不平衡问题，NACTI数据集中最大的'Head'类别占整个数据集的50%以上，需要专门的长尾识别方法来处理这种不平衡。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统研究了各种LTR损失函数和LTR敏感正则化方法，构建了减少偏差的测试集来评估域偏移。

Result: 最佳配置在NACTI测试集上达到99.40% Top-1准确率，比标准交叉熵的95.51%显著提升；在跨域测试中达到52.55%准确率，优于WCE损失的51.20%。

Conclusion: LTR增强调度器选择与最先进的LTR损失函数结合在野生动物领域表现一致优异，但LTR方法仍无法充分解决严重域偏移下'Tail'类别的灾难性失效问题。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统突触分类需要监督学习，但该方法无需预先知道突触类型数量，为选择涵盖突触结构范围的ground-truth提供了原则性方法。

Method: 利用同一神经元内邻近突触相似性高于不同细胞随机突触的观察，进行无监督分类，应用于果蝇数据。

Result: 成功分离出突触类别，无需预先指定类型数量。

Conclusion: 该方法为突触分类提供了新的无监督途径，具有无需预知类型数量和提供原则性ground-truth选择的优势。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全玻片图像的快速生成需要自动化方法进行高效处理和准确分类，以应对日益增长的数据处理需求。

Method: 使用UNI和Virchow2基础模型提取补丁级嵌入，通过均值聚合策略聚合成玻片级特征，然后训练多种机器学习分类器（逻辑回归、梯度提升树、随机森林）。

Result: Virchow2提取的特征在大多数玻片级分类器中优于UNI，逻辑回归模型达到90%准确率，但差异无统计学意义。均值聚合方法提供了可靠的玻片级特征表示。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自动化全玻片图像分类中具有潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展且有效的方法，并为玻片级表示学习的未来发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临关键挑战：2D提升方法存在视图间几何和外观不一致，3D隐式表示难以扩展，当前3D基础模型多为对象中心，限制了场景级生成的应用。

Method: 采用三个核心组件：(1)数据整理流程提取高质量场景块用于训练；(2)3D块修复机制实现上下文感知的场景扩展；(3)从粗到细的生成策略确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了构建大规模虚拟环境的能力，并为构建未来世界模型提供了潜力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BachVid是首个无需训练、无需参考图像就能实现一致性视频生成的方法，通过分析DiT的注意力机制和中间特征，提取前景掩码和匹配点，并将缓存变量注入新视频来确保多视频间的前景和背景一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖参考图像或大量训练，且往往只解决角色一致性，将背景一致性留给图像到视频模型处理。生成具有一致角色和背景的多个视频仍是一个重大挑战。

Method: 基于对DiT注意力机制和中间特征的系统分析，发现其在去噪过程中能提取前景掩码和识别匹配点。首先生成身份视频并缓存中间变量，然后将这些缓存变量注入到新生成视频的对应位置。

Result: 实验结果表明，BachVid在无需额外训练的情况下实现了生成视频的鲁棒一致性。

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种新颖高效的一致性视频生成解决方案，无需依赖参考图像或额外训练。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

TL;DR: 视觉扩散模型可直接在像素空间中解决几何问题，包括内接正方形问题、斯坦纳树问题和简单多边形问题，将几何推理转化为图像生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉扩散模型作为几何求解器的潜力，解决长期存在的几何难题，建立生成建模与几何问题求解之间的桥梁。

Method: 将几何问题实例视为图像，训练标准视觉扩散模型从高斯噪声生成近似有效解的图像，学习将噪声几何结构转换为正确配置。

Result: 模型成功生成了与精确解高度匹配的有效近似解，证明了视觉扩散模型在解决复杂几何问题上的有效性。

Conclusion: 在图像空间中操作为解决困难几何问题提供了通用实用框架，为处理更广泛几何任务开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Conclusion: 自反思方法能有效识别视觉模型对特定视觉特征的依赖，为模型鲁棒性和可解释性分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种人机协作流程，可将手绘平面草图转换为语义一致的3D BIM模型，利用多模态大语言模型实现多智能体推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让专家和非专家都能仅通过手绘草图来创建BIM模型，使BIM创建过程更加便捷和普及。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，结合感知提取、人工反馈、模式验证和自动化BIM脚本生成，将草图迭代优化为结构化JSON布局，再转换为可执行脚本生成3D BIM模型。

Result: 在10个不同平面图上测试显示：门窗开口初始捕获可靠性高，墙体检测初始准确率约83%，经几次反馈迭代后达到近乎完美对齐；所有类别的精确率、召回率和F1分数均保持在0.83以上，几何误差通过反馈修正逐步降至零。

Conclusion: MLLM驱动的多智能体推理能够使仅使用手绘草图创建BIM模型变得可行，适用于专家和非专家用户。

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型在开放领域创意生成中要么遵循熟悉的文化模式，要么在追求新颖性时牺牲连贯性的问题。

Method: 使用两个在WikiArt概念上微调的GPT-2模型：概念连贯性模型评估概念在艺术品中共同出现的合理性，文化背景模型估计这些组合在艺术家作品中的典型程度。CAS选择高连贯性、低典型性的概念组合。

Result: 在人类评估中优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，在感知原创性和和谐性方面与艺术专业学生表现相当。定量研究显示比GPT-4o产生更多样化的输出和更广泛的概念空间探索。

Conclusion: 人工文化异化可以释放自主代理的创造潜力，在保持内部一致性的同时生成偏离文化惯例的创意想法。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

Result: 提出的方法能够有效解决传统模糊数运算的问题，并通过多个应用实例进行了验证，提供了C++实现。

Conclusion: 外延模糊数为模糊数运算提供了一种更高效和实用的替代方法，扩展了模糊数的应用潜力。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录系统中药物数据标准化难题，特别是阿片类药物使用障碍治疗处方的跨系统监测问题。

Method: 定制开源大语言模型（Llama、Qwen、Gemma、MedGemma），从异构数据中提取统一处方属性，通过JSON模式处理、标准化和一致性检查。

Result: 在25,605条记录上评估，Qwen2.5-32B达到93.4%覆盖率和93.0%准确率，MedGemma-27B达到93.1%/92.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了脆弱的站点特定ETL流程，支持本地隐私保护部署，实现跨站点MOUD暴露、依从性和保留的一致性分析。

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在可靠性方面超越人类专家，需要建立原则性框架来确定何时应遵从AI输出而非人类判断，特别是在高风险情境中。

Method: 借鉴社会认识论理论，分析AI优先主义的经典反对意见，并发展基于全证据的AI遵从理论，强调AI输出应作为贡献性理由而非替代性理由。

Result: 提出基于全证据的AI遵从理论具有三大优势：防止专业知识萎缩、为有意义的人类监督提供认识论依据、解释AI不可靠时的合理不信任。

Conclusion: 基于全证据的AI遵从理论为确定何时应遵从AI提供了原则性方法，特别适用于需要严格可靠性的高风险情境。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

Motivation: 解决SQL和PostGIS等地理空间工具的复杂性对非专家用户造成的障碍，克服单智能体方法在处理空间查询语义和语法复杂性时的局限性。

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架，包含实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成和审查智能体，通过知识库、程序化模式分析和语义增强来确保查询正确性。

Result: 在KaggleDBQA基准测试中达到81.2%的准确率，在空间查询测试中达到87.7%的准确率（相比无审查智能体的76.7%有显著提升），且生成的查询语义更符合用户意图。

Conclusion: 该工作使空间分析更易访问，为空间文本到SQL系统提供了稳健且可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous

major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

Method: 首先识别与上下文中毒知识强相关的毒响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，并通过观察到的归因信号重用有前景但最初不成功的外部知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验结果显示，持续实现超过90%的高群体覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了知识冲突问题，能够大规模生成有效的RAG中毒知识。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

*Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt是一个自动化的提示优化框架，通过进化图优化方法改进LLM的提示设计和推理过程，在真实世界任务中显著提升性能并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在领域特定任务中为大型语言模型设计最优提示和推理过程是必要但具有挑战性的，需要解决如何整合领域知识、提高推理效率以及为领域专家提供知识整合指导等关键问题。

Method: EGO-Prompt从专家构建的初始语义因果图开始，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程生成推理指导，并迭代优化语义因果图和推理机制，使LLM能有效利用指导信息。

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务中，EGO-Prompt比最先进方法提高了7.32%-12.61%的F1分数，使小模型以不到20%的成本达到大模型性能，并输出可解释的领域特定语义因果图。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt成功实现了提示和推理过程的自动化优化，显著提升了LLM在领域特定任务中的性能、效率和可解释性。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

*Kou Misaki,Takuya Akiba*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SSoT是一种新的提示方法，通过让LLM先生成随机字符串来增加熵，然后从中提取随机性来选择答案，显著改善了LLM在概率指令跟随任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在需要单一确定性答案的任务中表现出色，但在概率指令跟随任务中表现不佳，存在偏见问题，影响需要非确定性行为的应用（如人类行为模拟、内容多样化、多人游戏）和生成响应的多样性。

Method: 提出String Seed of Thought (SSoT)提示方法：让LLM先生成一个随机字符串以产生足够的熵，然后通过操作这个字符串来提取随机性并推导最终答案，从而在保持多样性的同时遵守特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLM在概率指令跟随任务中的表现，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能。在NoveltyBench上的实验表明，SSoT的好处不仅限于闭集任务，还能通过增强响应多样性来改善开放式任务。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能够解决LLM在概率指令跟随任务中的偏见问题，提高生成响应的多样性，适用于需要非确定性行为的各种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

TL;DR: NuSA-CL是一个轻量级、无需内存的持续学习框架，通过低秩适应和约束任务特定权重更新到模型参数的近似零空间，来保护预训练视觉语言模型的零样本能力，同时避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在真实部署中面临环境变化和新类别出现的挑战，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法来适应变化同时避免遗忘。

Method: 使用低秩适应技术，将任务特定的权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已学知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效保护了零样本迁移能力，并在持续学习基准上取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL是实际可行的解决方案，适用于资源受限的真实世界持续学习环境中的零样本视觉语言模型持续演化。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出Shylock方法，用于在少样本和正常多变量时间序列中发现因果关系，通过组扩张卷积和共享核减少参数数量，结合全局和局部约束提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果关系发现方法依赖人工经验、统计方法或图形标准方法，容易出错、依赖理想化假设和大量数据。多变量时间序列存在数据缺口，现有方法容易过拟合。

Method: 使用组扩张卷积和共享核来指数级减少参数数量，结合全局和局部约束实现网络间信息共享，设计数据生成方法生成带时间延迟的MTS数据。

Result: 在常用基准测试和生成数据集上的广泛实验表明，Shylock在少样本和正常MTS上都优于两种现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Shylock方法能有效解决多变量时间序列因果关系发现问题，特别是在数据稀缺情况下表现优异，并开发了Tcausal库便于使用。

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large

Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business

process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

Motivation: 随着AI自主系统能力的扩展，如何严格证明其安全性成为关键挑战。OOD检测能够处理系统生命周期中的新颖和不确定情况，因此受到研究界和安全工程社区的日益关注。

Method: 通过全面文献综述，分析OOD检测技术，定义相关概念，探究OOD产生原因，识别ML开发生命周期中可用的技术，并讨论在系统生命周期中集成OOD检测的注意事项。

Result: 识别了一系列可在ML开发生命周期中使用的OOD检测技术，并提出了这些技术在支持安全保证论证中的适用阶段。

Conclusion: 总结了自主系统安全开发和运营面临的挑战，并提出了未来研究方向，以促进跨领域自主系统的安全发展。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度不鲁棒，在具有密集奖励的游戏中使用固定探索常数会导致性能问题。

Method: 评估了文献中提出的以及五种新提出的λ策略，包括基于Q值标准差的自适应方法。

Result: 新提出的λ=2σ策略在各种任务中优于现有λ策略，无论是单一参数值还是优化后的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 推荐使用λ=2σ作为UCT探索常数的自适应选择方法，该方法对游戏奖励尺度具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

Method: 分析多种大型推理模型的推理轨迹，发现自我越狱现象，提出Chain-of-Guardrail训练框架，重组或回溯不安全推理步骤，引导模型回到安全轨迹同时保持有效推理链。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoG显著提高了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Guardrail框架有效解决了大型推理模型的安全与推理权衡问题，通过重组不安全推理步骤实现了安全性的显著提升而不损害推理能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可信AI研究主要关注技术属性（可靠性、鲁棒性、公平性），而忽视了理解真实世界环境中AI可信度所需的社会技术维度，需要全面审视AI伦理社区如何概念化、测量和验证AI可信度。

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议论文集进行范围综述，系统分析可信度在不同研究领域中的定义、操作化和应用方式，重点关注概念化方法、测量方法、验证技术、应用领域和基础价值观。

Result: 研究发现虽然透明度、问责制和鲁棒性等技术属性的定义取得显著进展，但当前研究往往过度强调技术精度而牺牲社会伦理考量，AI系统的社会技术性质较少被探索，可信度成为由有权定义者塑造的争议概念。

Conclusion: 需要结合技术严谨性与社会、文化和制度考量的跨学科方法，AI伦理社区应采用整体框架，真正解决AI系统与社会之间复杂相互作用，促进对所有利益相关者有益的责任技术发展。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代码即策略方法在动态或部分可观测环境中存在环境基础不足的问题，导致代码生成错误或不完整，影响任务成功率。

Method: 结合显式符号验证和交互验证过程，在验证阶段生成探索性代码与环境交互获取缺失观测，同时保持任务相关状态。

Result: 在RLBench和真实世界动态部分可观测场景中的实验表明，任务成功率比Code-as-Policies基线提高46.2%，任务相关动作可执行性达到86.8%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强代码生成的环境基础，显著提高了动态环境中任务规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

Result: 在各种CXR解释任务上表现出色，能提供视觉证据并良好泛化到不同复杂度的临床任务。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协作和证据验证机制，显著提升了CXR分析的适应性、可靠性和诊断能力。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成创新想法时往往局限于训练数据中的常见概念，现有方法依赖不可靠的自评估启发式方法，需要更原则性的探索机制。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索，结合语义罗盘向量进行长程引导，以及基于景观感知的价值函数进行局部决策，平衡内在一致性、外在新颖性和叙事进展。

Result: 在生成科学想法方面，Magellan显著优于ReAct和ToT等基线方法，产生更具合理性和创新性的想法。

Conclusion: 对于创意发现，原则性引导搜索比无约束探索更有效，为LLM成为创新合作伙伴铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，SFT+RL模型在不同计算预算下表现更好，准确率更高，token使用量减少超过40%。

Conclusion: 强化学习可以恢复长上下文训练带来的损失，整体提升数学推理性能。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的LLM符号集成分类法，通过四个维度组织现有文献，包括集成阶段、耦合机制、架构范式以及算法和应用层面，旨在解决LLM透明度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在关键领域表现出色但缺乏透明度，现有神经符号AI方法主要针对传统神经网络，不适用于LLMs的特性，需要系统性地理解如何将符号AI有效集成到LLMs中。

Method: 首先回顾已建立的神经符号AI方法，然后提出LLM符号集成的新分类法，并制定将符号技术与LLMs合并的路线图，通过四个维度分类框架组织现有文献。

Result: 提出了包含四个维度的分类框架：LLM不同阶段的符号集成、耦合机制、架构范式、算法和应用层面视角，识别了当前基准、前沿进展和关键差距。

Conclusion: 通过突出最新发展和文献中的显著差距，为将符号集成框架实施到LLMs中以增强透明度提供了实用见解，并提出了未来研究的路线图。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

*Ankur Sinha,Shobhit Arora,Dhaval Pujara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoOpt-11k是一个包含11,000多个手写和打印数学优化模型图像的数据集，配套开发了AutoOpt框架，通过深度学习模型自动识别数学表达式并生成优化求解代码，实现从图像到优化问题求解的端到端自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决数学优化问题求解过程中需要人工建模和编程的繁琐过程，开发一个能够直接从图像识别优化问题并自动求解的系统。

Method: 开发了三模块框架：M1使用深度学习模型进行数学表达式识别生成LaTeX代码；M2使用微调的小型LLM将LaTeX转换为PYOMO脚本；M3使用双层优化分解方法求解优化问题。

Result: MER模型在BLEU得分上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；BOBD方法在复杂测试问题上比内点算法和遗传算法表现更好。

Conclusion: AutoOpt框架成功实现了从优化问题图像到自动求解的完整流程，在数学表达式识别和复杂优化问题求解方面都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MoSES框架，通过状态可分解MDP和专家混合机制，让统一求解器能够复用基础VRP变体的专用求解器，提升多任务车辆路径问题的求解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法学习统一求解器处理多约束VRP，但未充分利用VRP变体的组合结构，错失了专用基础求解器的优势。

Method: 提出状态可分解MDP将状态空间表示为基础状态空间的笛卡尔积，开发潜在空间扩展，通过混合函数在潜在空间复用最优基础策略，实现MoSES求解器。

Result: 在多个VRP变体上的广泛实验表明，MoSES优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过感知VRP变体间的共享组件特性并复用基础求解器，可以有效提升多任务VRP的求解性能。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EU-Agent-Bench是一个评估LLM代理在欧盟法律框架下合规性的基准测试，通过人类策划的场景测试代理是否会在看似良性的用户请求下采取非法行动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在各种场景中的部署增加，它们可能表现出不可预测的行为，包括采取不良和/或不安全的行动，需要评估其在欧盟立法背景下的潜在非法倾向。

Method: 创建可验证的人类策划基准，涵盖数据保护、偏见/歧视和科学诚信等多个类别，通过比较模型函数调用与详尽法律引用的评分标准来评估法律合规性，并研究在系统提示中提供相关法律摘录对合规性的影响。

Result: 评估了前沿LLM的法律合规性，并发现提供相关法律摘录和明确合规指令对代理行为有影响。发布了公开预览集供研究社区使用，同时保留私有测试集以防止数据污染。

Conclusion: 鼓励未来工作将代理安全基准扩展到不同法律管辖区以及多轮和多语言交互，并发布了代码供研究使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-Sight通过冲突感知元验证(CAMV)和可信推理结构化事实(TRSF)机制，将推理转化为可证伪和可审计的过程，解决了LLM智能体长程推理中的验证不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体的长程推理失败往往不是因为生成能力不足，而是由于中间推理过程缺乏充分验证。

Method: 使用CAMV将验证重构为冲突识别和针对性证伪，只在专家智能体间的分歧热点分配计算资源；TRSF通过结构化事实模块持续组织、验证和同步证据。

Result: 在GAIA上达到84.4%准确率，Humanity's Last Exam上35.5%，Chinese-SimpleQA上93.8%，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Co-Sight为LLM智能体提供了可扩展的可靠长程推理范式，结构化事实基础和冲突感知验证的协同作用是改进的关键。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用模仿学习训练神经控制屏障函数的方法，无需明确指定故障状态集，仅需专家演示数据即可学习安全约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶等关键领域，故障状态集往往难以形式化定义，而专家演示数据更容易获取。现有方法需要明确指定故障集，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用模仿学习训练约束函数来分类系统状态为安全或不安全，然后用该函数标注模拟轨迹来训练神经CBF。

Result: 在四个不同环境中实证评估，该方法优于现有基线，性能接近使用真实安全标签训练的神经CBF。

Conclusion: 该方法能够仅从专家演示中学习安全约束，无需明确指定故障集，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

TL;DR: 本文提出Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM)方法，通过估计编码代理的自我改进潜力(CMP指标)来指导自我修改树的搜索，在SWE-bench等基准测试中优于现有方法且耗时更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编码代理的自我改进方法假设更高的软件工程基准性能意味着更好的后续自我修改潜力，但作者发现自我改进潜力与编码基准性能之间存在不匹配问题。

Method: 提出CMP指标来评估代理的自我改进潜力，并基于此构建HGM方法，通过估计CMP来指导自我修改树的搜索过程。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified和Polyglot基准测试中，HGM优于现有方法且使用更少的计算时间，优化后的代理在SWE-bench Lite上达到人类水平性能。

Conclusion: HGM方法通过正确评估自我改进潜力而非仅关注当前性能，实现了更有效的编码代理自我改进，并展现出良好的迁移能力。

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

Conclusion: 这项工作向更通用和强大的现实世界应用代理迈出了一步。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

Result: 评估57个代理和22个代理类，发现AI在科学辅助方面虽有进展但仍有很大差距

Conclusion: 需要更严谨的基准来推动AI科学代理的发展，当前AI远未解决科学研究的辅助挑战

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，无需限制目标本体或实体的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建全面的知识图谱需要使用多个本体来充分将数据置于领域上下文中。简单的成对等价映射无法提供相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成。

Method: 使用检索增强生成选择相关类来组成映射，并过滤匹配参考映射作为示例来增强上下文学习。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中，CMOMgen在类选择方面优于基线方法，F1分数至少达到63%，在两个任务中优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。手动评估显示46%的映射获得最高分。

Conclusion: CMOMgen能够构建语义合理的复杂多本体映射，在生物医学领域表现出色。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

Motivation: 企业公关活动常存在言行不一的问题，如石油公司的"漂绿"行为。理解大规模框架及其变化有助于分析公关活动的目标和性质。

Method: 构建了一个包含Facebook和YouTube视频广告的基准数据集，标注了13种框架类型，涵盖50多家公司和20个国家，专门用于视觉语言模型评估。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1能检测环境信息，F1分数达79%，但最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅达46% F1分数。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源行业战略沟通的多模态分析研究，同时揭示了视觉语言模型在处理隐含框架、不同长度视频和文化背景等方面的挑战。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
