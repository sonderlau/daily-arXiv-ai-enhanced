In recent years, advancements in Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new\nheights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,\ntraditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting\npredefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The\nadvent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this\nlimitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can\nidentify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This\nbreakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in\naerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD\nin the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles\nof OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a\nspecialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic\ntaxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides\na comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review\nenables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the\nintersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline\npromising future research directions and application prospects. This survey\naims to provide a clear road map and a valuable reference for both newcomers\nand seasoned researchers, fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving domain.\nWe keep tracing related works at\nhttps://github.com/zhouyang2002/OVOD-in-UVA-imagery"}

However, existing architectures, such as\nYOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales\nwhile balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework\ndesigned to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving\ndetection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:\nFrequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which\nrefines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency\nfiltering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive\nHierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively\nintegrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen\nhierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,\nand Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation\ncapabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while\nreducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and\nintegration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that\nachieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational\nefficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios.

To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper\nintroduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.\nThe dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,\nwith data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.\nWe also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid\nfoundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on\nour newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian\nattribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for\nperson re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only\neffectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event\nstreams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic\nfeatures. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully\nvalidated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.\nThe benchmark dataset and source code will be released on\nhttps://github.com/Event-AHU/Neuromorphic_ReID"}

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism.

In this paper, we explore\nVAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation\nprocess for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel\nmethod that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating\noptimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their\nrespective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method\nto mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented\nKey-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation.

Their\nsupervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,\nedited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect\nonly prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical\nplausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated\nedit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an\nautomated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,\nresolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative\nmodels and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned\nGemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,\nremoving any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and\ncompositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,\nenabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most\nrepetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training\nwithout human labeling effort. To democratize research in this\nresource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k\nhigh-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses\nall public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source\nfine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our\nexperiments."}

Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in\nSSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to\nlarge codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to\naccount for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we\nintroduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on\nnested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features\ninto increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,\nenabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a\nnovel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional\nbiases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic\ncontent. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions\nestablish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and\nopen a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for\nthe broader AI community.

Starting from\nstandard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired\nlearning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to\nuse in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired\nlearning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a\nsingle rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of\nbio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on\nCIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on\nImageNet.

However, diagnosing AD remains a significant\nchallenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection\nbias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention\nframework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal\nIntervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language\nmodel (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining\nstructured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.\nThe ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)\nimages and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into\nCognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of\nconfounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,\nnon-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,\ngenerating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates\nconfounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the\noutstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,\nachieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics.
