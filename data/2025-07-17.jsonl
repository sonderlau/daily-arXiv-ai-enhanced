While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages.

The nature of this\nNIW--mesoscale interaction depends on how dispersive the waves are. For weakly\ndispersive waves, ray tracing suggests that the NIW frequency should be shifted\nby $\\frac{1}{2}\\zeta$, where $\\zeta$ is the mesoscale vorticity, and that the\nwaves are refracted into anticyclones. Strongly dispersive waves, in contrast,\nretain the large-scale structure of the wind forcing and exhibit a small\nnegative frequency shift. Previous in situ observational studies have indeed\nrevealed varying degrees of NIW--mesoscale interaction. Here, observations of\nNIWs from drifters are used to map the geography of NIW--mesoscale interactions\nglobally, and idealized simulations and a simple model are used to identify the\nunderlying physical processes. Almost everywhere in the ocean, with the notable\nexception of the North Pacific, the NIW frequency is strongly modulated by the\nmesoscale vorticity, with the slope of the frequency shift vs. vorticity taking\nvalues of approximately $0.4$. Concentration of NIW energy into anticyclones is\na common feature throughout the ocean. Other aspects of the observations,\nhowever, show signatures of strongly dispersive waves: a negative frequency\nshift and weaker concentration into anticyclones in regions with strong eddies\nas well as weak modulation of the NIW frequency by mesoscale eddies in the\nNorth Pacific. The signatures of both weakly and strongly dispersive NIW\nbehavior can be rationalized by the geography of the wave dispersiveness and\nthe fact that wind forcing excites multiple vertical modes with different wave\ndispersiveness. These results have implications for NIW-induced mixing in the\nupper-ocean."}

These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing\nLLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such\nas linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark\ncovering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic\nevaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a\n7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on\nhard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel\nsynthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a\nlimited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for\ndiversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key\ninsight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong\ncorrectness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such\nguarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse\nformulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both\napproaches and the importance of combining them."}

For the NR model, we extract the global\nmean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware\nrepresentation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we\npre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA\ndataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset.

Designing intelligent systems with\nhuman-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial\nintelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable\nsuccess in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs\nor parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often\nmeans retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,\nwhich increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific\napproaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver\n(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we\nprove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of\nestimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we\nillustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional\ngenerative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a\nsingle round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning\nability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of\nzero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from\nunseen AVR tasks in the testing phase."}

Although unsupervised\npart discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot\nmaintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts\ntheir application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more\neffective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part\nAutoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map\nfrom the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the\noriginal images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part\ndescriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.\nBy restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become\nbetter aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from\nunmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that\nclosely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,\nseveral looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to\nidentify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an\nunsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges\nposed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple\ncategories.

Simulation results further\nshow that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing\ngeometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU,\nwe introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation\ncoefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with\ndiverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC\nshow that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses\nacross various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in\nsmall object detection, confirming their effectiveness."}

While 3D CNNs have been effective at\ncapturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage\nself-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain\ncomputationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this,\nwe propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which\ndistills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a\ncompact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net\nutilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to\nsignificantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.\nWe employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal\nfocal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the\nVideo-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate\nDVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it\nagainst recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR).\nAdditionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of\nforward KL divergence.
